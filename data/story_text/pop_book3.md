**Chapter 1: Dangerous Secrets**

***July 8, 1899***

***Godric's Hollow***

***3:14 PM***

Godric's Hollow was a quaint little place that reminded Gellert of Kirchdorf. A squat town square made up the village's centre, surrounded by dense thickets of trees. Muggles dwelled here just like back home. Gellert's lip curled. *Their taint is everywhere.*

Britain was just as bad as Germany. Gellert had arrived here just last night and asked his aunt whether or not Godric's Hollow was made up only of witches and wizards. She had laughed and told him that the nearest purely wizarding settlement was miles away in a place called Hogsmeade. *Disgusting.*

This was the first time Gellert had been so close to muggles in years. How he craved to draw his wand and dole out justice. He could use one of them. The experiment that had him thrown from Durmstrang need not have been wasted. It would be merciful --- better that than to live without magic.

Gellert turned off the cobblestone walkway and up to the front door of a small home surrounded by a high fence whose wood was peeling. It looked a sorry sight, but he could feel the magic saturating every inch. *These people have sense keeping the muggles away. Aunt Bathilda keeps decent company.*

Gellert knocked thrice upon the door, then waited. No sound came but it soon opened, revealing a thin boy who brushed auburn hair away from piercing blue eyes. *There's a sharpness in his stare*.

"Good afternoon."

"Good afternoon. You are Albus Dumbledore?"

"I am, yes. Who might you be?"

"My name is Gellert Grindelwald. I believe you know my Aunt Bathilda?"

"I do. She's been a good friend of the family. Has she sent you?"

"She offers your family invitations to join us tonight." Keeping his voice level became difficult. "She believes the two of us will get on well."

The first thing his aunt said upon his arrival was how much he reminded her of this Albus Dumbledore. No one had ever been like Gellert. Why his aunt thought differently now, he knew not.

Dumbledore's face twitched. He looked bitter, but only for a heartbeat.

"Is something the matter?"

"There are just things that might make attending more difficult than it ought to be."

*This boy's not like me at all. Nothing would stop me from doing as I wanted.* The longer he watched, the more he thought he was missing something. Dumbledore looked wary. *Does he know of me? Has my reputation spread, or is my aunt a blabbermouth?*

Gellert looked up and met those eyes again. A small girl wept beneath a canopy of bright green leaves. The leaves began changing --- green, then orange, then brown --- and tumbled from the trees, dead by the time they reached the ground.

Sharp pain stabbed behind his eyes. He caught it and twisted, reaching out for another strand of memory. His psychic fingers were brushed aside. *An occlumens.*

Those blue eyes widened, but then Dumbledore's expression smoothed. "Tell your aunt that I, at least, will attend. My sister is sick and I'm unsure whether she or my brother will make it."

Gellert bowed his head. *He is more than I expected.* "Good day to you, Dumbledore."

"Grindelwald," Gellert tilted his head to the side. "I expect you won't treat my family so invasively if and when you meet them."

A thin smile crested his lips. "I would never dream of it."

"I'm surprised you waited as long as you did to start showing me memories again," said Harry, peering around the tower cell.

"I am generous to those who deserve my courtesy."

"So you knew Dumbledore before the duel?"

"I knew him better than anyone alive except perhaps his own brother."

"What was he like?"

"Albus?"

"No, Aberforth. He taught Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts last year."

Grindelwald tilted his head. "And you were not fond of him?"

"I don't know."

"How is this?"

"It's a long story. He just picked a rough way to go about things."

Grindelwald's lips twitched. "That sounds characteristic."

"I never knew he had a sister."

"I am unsurprised. Albus always liked his secrets. That one was guarded closely." Grindelwald peered out from between the bars covering his window, then looked back at him. "Do you have any more questions?"

Harry chewed his words, trying to choose the right ones. "When you walked up to the door, I could feel magic; it was all over the house."

"It pleases me that you noticed. What did it feel like?"

It suddenly struck Harry how mad this all was. The way they talked, it was like nothing had ever been wrong. *Get over it; if he wanted to kill you, you'd be dead. Think how much you'll learn.* "It felt... thick, maybe heavy. I don't know how to explain it."

"Oppressive."

"Yeah, that." There was a pause. "So what was that all about?"

Grindelwald interlaced his fingers. "There was a collection of wards. I had mastered the ability to sense magic --- you experienced that in the memory."

"Sense magic?" Harry remembered feeling waves of something rolling off the Mirror of Erised. *Was I doing it then without realizing? Like how I made things happen before Hogwarts?*

"The craft is invaluable but immensely complex. You will master it in time."

Harry perked up. "Will I?"

"You will."

"How?"

Grindelwald smirked. "I intend to help you master many things now that we are on such open terms."

***July 11, 1993***

***The Burrow***

***9:12 AM***

Ron nearly slammed his head against the kitchen table, his mother's scream echoing inside his skull. He grimaced, shutting his eyes against the noise. *One of these days, she'll break a window.*

Something did break. Percy flinched, slamming his hand against a cup and sending it tumbling to the floor. Ron's elder brother flushed. He would be able to fix things like that with magic in just over a month, but not quite yet.

"Arthur!" Molly shouted. His father was moving towards the door to leave for work. "Arthur, come back! We won!"

Ron heard his father's footsteps halt. "Won?"

"Yes, Arthur! Won! The galleon draw! We won!"

Ron suddenly realized that his mother was crying. He exchanged uncomfortable looks with the twins as the sound of their father's footsteps returned. *Galleon draw?*

"Did we really?" he asked once back, moving behind his wife's chair and reading that morning's *Daily Prophet* over her shoulder. "Merlin, we really won."

Ron watched as his mother leapt up and hugged his father, sobbing into his chest.

*This is nice and all, but do they have to do it here?* A grin spread across his face regardless.

Smiling felt odd. That expression had been so scarce since leaving the Chamber of Secrets that Ron had almost forgotten what it felt like.

The only times he had smiled were when Cedric was over, much like last summer. *If only he knew what really happened.*

Thinking about that just made him remember blonde hair pooled around an innocent face, crimson fingers reaching from her chest, spreading across the dark stone floor.

His nightmares made those memories worse. Ron wasn't alone in his suffering, though regret tugged so hard at him that he felt it in his stomach. Luna had been one of Ginny's oldest friends. Never had they been thick as thieves, but he still heard her sobbing from her bedroom the first few nights and knew how it felt to lose a friend. He ought to have gone to her, but what would he say? *I can't even figure myself out; it's not like I could help her.*

*Idiot! Snap out of it! First good thing that happens all summer and you're ruining it.* "What are we going to do with it?" his mother was asking.

"We need to save," his father said, scratching his balding head. "Merlin knows we can't let ourselves get so low on gold again."

His mother tutted. "Yes, but it's seven hundred galleons! We can save half and still do something special."

"Let's think about it; there's no need to do anything rash." His father looked out the kitchen window while he straightened his robes. "I really must be off."

"Yes, yes, get to the ministry."

Something special? *Weird. Mum's always nervous about spending money.* Then he looked across the table and saw the shadows beneath Ginny's eyes. The pain in his stomach returned, tenfold now. *It's because of everything that's happened... Merlin, why is everything my fault?*

***July 17, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***8:53 AM***

Harry was fond of the dining hall at Black Manor. Probably because it was the opposite of the one he'd grown up with on Privet Drive. Vernon and Petunia\'s was bright, flanked by white walls. The one at Black Manor was set before towering windows made from black stained glass dimming any light that entered.

Harry sat waiting at the table, lit by a handful of floating candles. The loud crack accompanying Kreacher's appearance no longer startled him. "Can Kreacher be making Master Harry breakfast?"

Harry smiled, still bemused. *Merlin*, he thought, *we've come a long way in a month.*

***Earlier...***

The train slowed, King's Cross Station looming up ahead. *No kidnappings this time; I'll take that as a win.* The entire journey felt like a dream. Tension still remained between Harry and Draco, but being able to talk with Pansy and Theodore made up for that. *I can't believe how natural it feels after so much time.*

The platform was full to bursting. They all filed behind Crabbe and Goyle, who forced a path through the crowd of bodies.

Draco went to his father the moment they found him, but Theodore placed a hand on Harry's arm. "I might not see you for a while."

Harry raised an eyebrow. "Why not? Are you and your father travelling again?"

Theodore's face was unreadable. "No, I don't think so. Father just wants my help with some things."

Images flashed behind his eyes. Tiberius Nott sitting at a long table, curtains drawn across the window behind him. The world bathed in billowing steam, blissful air tickling chalk-white skin.

A shiver ran up Harry's spine. *What was that last one?* "Hopefully he doesn't keep you busy all summer," said Harry, feigning a smile.

"I'm sure I'll slip away for your birthday." Theodore held out his hand and Harry took it, shaking firmly. "Take care, Harry."

"You too, Theodore, have a nice summer."

Not until Theodore and the Malfoys left did Harry remove a raven-shaped pendant from his pocket. "Toujours Pur."

Something tugged behind his naval. His heart raced, breath caught in his chest as the world blurred around him. *Get a grip! This one was planned; you're not being kidnapped!*

Harry's feet slammed against a well-polished floor. *This must be the entrance hall.* Obsidian pillars flanked towering windows obscured by dark curtains. A mosaic sprawled across the floor; a field of blooming roses beneath a star-filled sky. Plinths were interspersed around the hall's edge, each topped with a raven carved from stone.

*CRACK!*

The oldest elf he'd ever seen appeared. Wispy white hair sprouted from its ears, its teeth past rotting and its grey skin hung in places.

"Kreacher's new master is here, and what a master he is, tainted by muggle filth. They say he lived with them. What would my mistress say?"

"Something foul if she was sensible." The elf looked up, wide-eyed. Harry almost laughed. "Did you expect me to defend them?"

Kreacher's ears perked. "Master doesn't seem tainted to Kreacher."

Harry scowled. "You can't live with muggles and not be tainted."

Kreacher frowned. "Kreacher is confused by his new master."

***Back in the present...***

"Yes, please. I'll take some eggs with bacon and toast."

Kreacher bowed so low his nose scraped against the floor, then he was gone with another loud *CRACK.*

"I don't know how you've won him over so quickly," said Regulus, sipping at his tea.

Harry shrugged. "It wasn't that hard. I just acted like a pureblood and let him know I hated muggles."

"That does go a long way in this family, yes."

"Your mother's portrait probably didn't hurt."

"No, I imagine not." Regulus chuckled. "My dear old mother would die another death if she realized she was teaching a halfblood."

Regulus said his mother had gone insane, but her portrait here was done long before that happened. Harry could see the seeds of madness, but she was relatively sane. There had only been a few outbursts whilst she taught him the finer points of wizarding etiquette, and none about him. The moment Regulus introduced him as a pureblood heir and the best friend of Narcissa Black's son, all had gone smoothly.

Regulus had still been concerned, warning him before that first meeting. *"So long as you don't bring up muggles, muggleborns, Grindelwald, the Dark Lord, or my brother, you should be fine."*

*"Is that all?"*

*"Probably not, but those are the important ones. Best not mention that you're a halfblood, but we've covered that already."*

"What are you reading?" Harry asked as he took the chair nearest Regulus, who held something too thick to be that morning's paper.

"I ordered you a copy --- here." The Black Lord withdrew his wand and gave it a flick, summoning a rectangular box. Harry frowned and opened it.

His breath caught. An auburn-haired teenager stared out at him from the cover with familiar blue eyes, arm in arm with a blond-haired youth who could only be Grindelwald.

Harry removed the book, turning it to read the back cover.

*Stripping away the serene facade of silver-haired wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals all. A disturbed childhood and lawless youth, lifelong feuds forming from a suspicious demise, guilty secrets leading to the death of millions --- all of this and more is uncovered in the riveting* Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore*.*

***July 18, 1993***

***The Headmaster's Office***

***9:00 PM***

A strong summer wind blew outside, rattling panes of glass. Fawkes lifted his head and peered at Severus, then out the large window. The sky was a deep shade of purple and the light was fading fast.

A clock chimed and Dumbledore looked up from a heaping stack of papers. "I apologize for my tardiness. Thank you for coming, Severus."

Severus inclined his head. "I am here to serve, Headmaster."

"A fact for which I will always be grateful." *His smile is too strained. His news is dire.*

Severus curled his lip. "I presume you have not brought me here to offer the position I have long thirsted for?"

Dumbledore smiled a sad smile. "I'm afraid not. You are much too valuable; I would not leave you to the mercy of Lord Voldemort's curse."

Severus suppressed a shudder at the Dark Lord's name. *He says it with no regard for those around him.* "What of your brother? He is safe and whole; I see no obvious signs of a curse."

Dumbledore opened a desk drawer and removed a thick book, his own face smiling up from the front cover. "Have you paid Miss Skeeter's work much mind?"

"I have read some. My faith in her writing is low."

Dumbledore sighed. "She has done well this time around. I fear how she learned these pages' secrets, but many are true."

Severus studied him. "You fear how she learned them?"

"She writes about things only three living people know of. I told her nothing, nor did Aberforth."

"Who is the third?"

"Bathilda Bagshot. A delightful woman who is well past her age and vulnerable to the whims of youth."

His lip curled again, bile rising in the back of his throat. "Have you not reported her?"

"Not while Lucius Malfoy holds such a tight grip on much of the ministry. Reports may be seen as flustered defences. That is the last thing I need after the school's recent fiasco."

"What does any of this have to do with your brother and the curse?"

Dumbledore put the book down on his desk. "This book taints Aberforth as well as I. He knew it would when it was announced and resigned. Had he stayed, the parents and governors would have forced his hand."

Severus narrowed his eyes. "Does it not slander you more fiercely?"

"It does."

"And you intend to remain at Hogwarts?"

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "I have advantages Aberforth does not and am not so easily replaced, if you will pardon my arrogance."

*The two greatest wizards I have ever known and the difference between each is so stark.* "If you wish to blame the curse for Skeeter's writings, then very well. What is it you summoned me for?"

"I wished to ask if there were any signs pointing to Lord Voldemort's return?"

Severus crushed a flash of shock and kept his face schooled. "Signs?" Something nagged at him, but it slipped through his fingers each time he reached for it. *Strange.*

"Yes. I think it is suspicious his evil has touched Hogwarts two years in a row. That is saying nothing about Tiberius Nott's newest accessory."

Severus paused. "Newest... accessory?"

"Tiberius wears a glove any time I have seen him in public. It is a queer choice that I consider suspicious."

*Why must the world's greatest wizard be so utterly mad?* "I fail to see a connection between the Dark Lord and a glove."

Dumbledore's smile returned, bitter this time. "Do you? Answer me something, Severus. If you were to concoct a ritual that might return Voldemort to his powers, how would you do it?"

*Ah... ominous.* "There would be blood," he admitted.

"Sacrifice, yes, one of the few things powerful enough to achieve what he seeks. I suspect many might be surprised if they looked beneath that glove."

His pulse quickened. *Bloody hell.* "So you think the Dark Lord has returned?"

"I am unsure. The ritual could simply have returned him to a rudimentary form. When I faced him in that corridor more than a year ago, he was scarcely a shadow."

Severus cleared his mind; he had bargained for none of this. "I have heard nothing. None of the old guard trust me completely. People like Lucius remain amiable, but many consider me a traitor."

"Yes," said Dumbledore, scratching at his beard. "I had hoped for other signs, though I don't know what they would be." That nagging returned, but Severus ignored it. *My mind is playing tricks, how strange.* "Do keep your eyes peeled and watch out for Harry."

Rage built inside him. *How am I to watch a boy who cares nothing for himself?* He sneered. "I hope only that Potter has heeded my warnings."

Dumbledore shoved the book back into the drawer it came from. "Is that what you call them, Severus? I have heard you were most unpleasant this past year."

"If the boy would read between the lines, he would know that I am advising caution and responsibility. It is all good so long as Lily's magic protects him, but there are others to consider. I hoped that pairing him with the Crabbe dolt would prompt greater consideration for those around him."

Dumbledore's lips curved down. "You have strange ways of making your point. Regardless, watch him for me?"

Severus stood, bowing before he left the room. "Always."

**Book 3: The Looming of Shadows**

**Chapter 2: Black Tidings**

***July 24, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***4:13 PM***

Heavy black curtains were pulled shut over towering windows, plunging the Black family library into darkness except for the candles and torches burning throughout the room. The shelves reached up so high that some of them were lost in shadow. They reminded Harry of the tunnel leading to the Chamber of Secrets. *This place is probably about as dangerous.*

Regulus had warned him about the Black family library the first night of summer. *"It might be the country's largest collection of books on twisted magic."*

Most of his time here hadn't been spent reading any of the Blacks' books, but *The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.*

The book had divided public opinion. Rita Skeeter had droves of devoted readers who took everything she said as gospel. They were a raging mob, shouting for Dumbledore to relinquish his positions of power.

*"Do you think they'll get their way?"* Harry had asked Regulus over dinner.

Regulus just shook his head. *"Not a chance. Dumbledore has too much power and support. It would take something catastrophic for him to lose his positions unless the ministry or Wizengamot actively pushed for it."*

*"And neither of them are?"* Regulus shook his head again, chewing his steak. *"I would have thought people like Lord Malfoy would take the chance to try weakening Dumbledore's base of power."*

*"You're learning, but slowly."*

*"What do you mean?"*

*"Plenty of idiots believe everything Skeeter says, but plenty more have functional minds and think for themselves. Skeeter has spouted off too much nonsense over the years for people to believe all this. It's a start. If something else happens, Dumbledore would have a hard time fending off the masses. He might still give up a position for the sake of public appearances, but no more than that. People like Lucius will be hoping for something bigger to happen while Dumbledore is more vulnerable than he's ever been. That's when they'll pounce. Not over a book full of rumours."*

*If only people realized most of the rumours might actually be true.* Dumbledore really had been friends with Grindelwald. How far that had gone, he did not yet know, but there had been something there.

***July 20, 1899***

***The Dumbledore Family Home***

***6:22 PM***

"Believing any trail to them remains here is foolish."

Days had been spent together since that first dinner. The two of them had bonded from the moment his aunt mentioned the Deathly Hallows. Gellert's obsession had reignited with another believer onside, and they had talked of little else since.

Now they sat in Albus's living room and rehashed the old debate. It never ceased to frustrate Gellert. *Never have I met anyone so controlled by their own closed-mindedness.* A fire swirled inside his chest, purpose unlike anything he had ever known. *I must break these barriers --- for him and the world.*

"Why are you so insistent on this?" he asked. "This is the resting place of the most successful Peverell. Surely you do not mean to tell me you believe the tale's fancies about Death after all this time?"

"I've found the same sources and drawn the same conclusions you have about the Peverells."

"Then why would this not be the beginning? Ignotus once called this place home. The others might have for all we know. There must be traces."

"I have told you already that I've known of the Hallows for longer than you. I heard the story years ago."

"As did I."

"But I didn't wait. Patience has never been a virtue of mine. I searched everywhere I could. You don't think I've scoured Ignotus Peverell's grave? You don't think I've searched every corner of this infernal place?"

Gellert smirked. "Perhaps I just think I'm more gifted than you are and believe that I can do something that you could not."

"Then you're more arrogant than I took you for."

"What one man calls arrogance, another calls confidence. It has always served me well; I see my paths and speak them into being."

Albus's lips thinned. "I have never been fond of Divination."

"Why not? There are records that prove its power."

"A small number of records over thousands of years. My point isn't that Divination doesn't exist. My point is that so few have the gift that the subject is all but obsolete."

Gallery smirked again. "How shortsighted of you."

"I prefer to call it pragmatic."

Gellert laughed, a cold and wild sound that poured from his lips. *I never realized how rarely I laughed; the sound has changed since I was a boy.*

"Do you, Albus?"

Gellert's head snapped around. The voice came from the sitting room's entrance.

Standing at the threshold was a boy who looked remarkably like Albus; he had the same long face, auburn hair, and the same piercing blue eyes, but he was shorter and not quite so thin. A girl hung from his arm. Gellert thought for a moment that she was a partner, but then he looked closer and remembered her sitting beneath a canopy of dying leaves.

"Your siblings?"

"Yes. Aberforth, Ariana, this is Gellert Grindelwald. He is Bathilda's nephew and has become a dear friend of mine."

"That explains a lot," snarled Aberforth, scowling. "I've never seen you so neglectful."

The air grew frosty. *Neglectful? What nonsense is he speaking?*

"Aberforth, there is a time and a place---"

"That time is now. Look at her!" He turned the girl towards her older brother. *Frail is not the half of it; Albus understated.*

"Ariana, what's wrong?"

The girl trembled, tears welling in her eyes. Gellert watched as his friend deflated. *There is more here than I realized.*

*"Tell your aunt that I, at least, will attend. My sister is sick and I'm unsure whether she or my brother will make it."*

Gellert's pulse quickened, anger boiling beneath his skin. *Another wizard made a slave to lesser beings. When does it end?* Albus agreed about the muggles. Those talks always made him uneasy, but he agreed. *Why let them control him? He must know there's nothing he can do for her.*

Gellert formed tendrils of magic and reached out towards her. The gesture was small and subtle; just enough to brush her mind.

Flaming daggers descended inside his skull. A short breath escaped him and his hand drifted towards his wand. Albus must have noticed; he would attack at any moment.

Nothing came. The girl was looking at him with wide, fearful eyes. The boy beside her still stared at Albus. *Impossible; she's a child.* There was no other explanation. *A natural occlumens? How can she possess such skills but be so broken?*

"I'll leave." There was nothing to be done. Albus would see reason in his own time; he had to. "It was a pleasure meeting you both." He smiled at the youngest Dumbledore. "I hope your health improves, Ariana."

"You don't need to leave," said Albus. Gellert almost grinned at the look on his face. *Yes, he will learn soon; he resents it already.*

His stomach twisted. Thinking of Albus like he did others always made him feel sick. He was better than them --- the only person who ever made Gellert feel whole. *It will be better for him; you act for the greater good.*

"It's all right. I'm sure we'll talk soon."

"I'll owl you this evening; our discussion is unfinished."

Gellert threw a careless grin over his shoulder. "I look forward to your letter."

***Back in the present...***

*I'd ask him to speed the memories up if it wasn't letting him win.* Giving Grindelwald inches worried him. Giving him the chance to take a mile was almost unthinkable. But Merlin, he was curious. *How did they go from being so close, to the greatest duel of all time?*

Skeeter wrote about Grindelwald fleeing after Ariana's death, but he hoped that was untrue. If Grindelwald had been the one to kill her... that did odd things to his mind when he considered how similar they were, often surfacing another memory.

*"We're similar, you know. Both halfbloods, both orphans raised by muggles unfit to lick the hems of our robes. We were both sorted into Slytherin House and quickly became prodigies in our own right. We're probably the only two Parselmouths who have come through this school since the great Salazar Slytherin himself and we even look somewhat alike."*

*Shut up, Riddle! I'm nothing like you! I'm better --- I'll prove it!*

***Meanwhile, in Cairo, Egypt...***

"I dunno how you put up with it," Ron told Bill as the two of them trudged through a sea of sand that smouldered under a blistering sun. "That portkey was awful."

"International ones are never pleasant, but getting paid to take them helps."

"Guess it would, yeah," Ron grunted, wiping sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand.

Bill had greeted them an hour ago, waiting at their point of arrival. Having spent the past handful of years working here, he knew the land well and had taken time off work, sans a few low-risk expeditions he said would take little time.

Bill had been staring a hole right through him from the moment they'd arrived. *The hell did mum tell him?*

"Is it always this hot?" Ron asked.

Bill pushed sweat-soaked hair back from his eyes. "You lot chose the hottest time of the year to pay me a visit, but it's never exactly like back home."

"Somewhere in between would be nice."

"Funny how things usually don't end up that way. How have you enjoyed Hogwarts?"

That was a trap question if he'd ever heard one. *Blimey, Bill's the one I always got on well with.* "Snape's as big a git as any of you said, and Quidditch is great."

Bill snorted. "Youngest seeker in a century they've taken to calling you?"

Ron blushed. "They did in first year. The nickname died a bit when I lost to Potter."

"I heard about that too. Something about a cursed bludger?"

"It wouldn't leave him alone. Chased him no matter what he did. Fred and George have never let me live that down; the fact I lost to someone who was busy flying away from a bludger the whole game."

"Not your finest moment, no." Bill came to a stop and withdrew his wand, conjuring a blanket and taking a seat, gesturing for Ron to do the same. "We've been walking for almost an hour. It's best to rest in this heat."

"I'm fine," Ron defended, wiping more sweat from his face.

Bill gave him a hard look. "Poor choice of words."

"What---"

"You're a lot of things, but I doubt fine is one of them. Not after how your last two years at Hogwarts ended."

Ron's cheeks burned. "Have Mum and Dad---"

"No one's put me up to anything. If you must know, they did write to tell me what happened, but nothing more than that." He gave Ron a pointed look. "I first saw a friend die during an expedition *after* I graduated."

Ron sobered. "Sorry," he muttered. "I never knew that happened."

"Every cursebreaker sees it. We got too close to a violent ward; he was the closest." Bill removed two flasks of water from his bag, handing one to Ron and taking a deep pull from the other. "That day popped up in my dreams for months, and I wasn't eleven."

Ron hunched his shoulders. "That was more than a year ago. It was really hard, but I've had time."

Ron shifted beneath his brother's gaze. *Did I mess up?* "I was under the impression that Neville Longbottom fell down a flight of stairs."

Cold seeped through his veins despite the blazing sun. *I definitely messed up.* "What---"

"I said that I watched someone die and you implied you went through that same thing after his death."

"I didn't mean---"

"Didn't mean to tell me? No, I imagine not." Bill took another sip of water while Ron fussed with his robes, heart pounding against his ribs. "Since you've been bottling it up for a year, do you care to actually tell someone how Neville Longbottom died?"

"I didn't see it. Honest, I didn't."

"So you were proxy to it; it's close enough."

*Why does he have to be so bloody smart?* "I can't."

"Why not?" asked Bill, lying down on the blanket and peering up at Ron. "You know I'm not the type to run off and tell Mum or Dad."

Ron wrung his hands. "I promised Dumbledore I wouldn't say anything to anyone --- even my family."

"Did you now?" Bill asked with a frown. "Serious business, then. Is it at least safe to say what happened was no simple accident at school?"

Ron nodded. "It wasn't, no. I... wish it was."

Bill scowled. "Then you're a fool."

Ron's eyes widened. "What---"

"If it was no accident, then it meant something. Some stupid fall down a jinxed set of stairs is meaningless. It doesn't do the person justice. I don't know how Longbottom died, but your reactions tell me it had more purpose than that."

Ron swallowed a lump in his throat. "It... yeah, it did."

"There you go. What about Lovegood's?"

Ron blinked back hot tears. "I saw that one."

It was so close. Ron could feel the truth on his tongue. The moment was perfect, but something gave him pause. The last thing he wanted was for Bill to think him some sort of fool. *And that's if he doesn't think I'm a killer.*

"And that's the worst part for you?" He nodded. "There's no easy advice to help with this one. All I can say is that you'll work through it and that you should learn from it."

Ron swallowed hard again. "What do you mean learn from it?"

Bill shrugged. "It's hard to say without knowing more. I know that you were in the Chamber of Secrets with that supposed Heir of Slytherin. It must not have been a pleasant thing to see, but there was probably a lesson to be learned. Something that can be taken away from it that will make you better."

Another lump formed in Ron's throat. "I'll think about it," he rasped. "I just don't want to think about it all that much."

"Distractions are nice." Bill took his longest sip of water yet, but his eyes never left Ron. "Do you remember what you said when I first told the family I wanted to be a cursebreaker?" Ron shook his head. "You said that you were going to become one, too." Bill grinned. "If professional Quidditch didn't work out, of course."

Heat flooded his cheeks again. "It sounded cool."

"Does it still? Even after I've told you about colleagues stumbling to their deaths?"

"That doesn't make it any less cool. It just means it's more serious than I realized as a kid."

Bill chuckled. "You're still a kid whether you like it or not. You'll tell me I was right in two years, then again in another two, then again two years after that."

"Yeah, yeah, whatever. So, what were you saying about cursebreaking?"

"The sites I'll be off to whilst you lot are here have already been examined. It's simple work. Go in, take down some wards, and remove whatever they're protecting."

"So?"

"If you wanted the distraction and any of those expeditions landed on days the family wasn't doing anything interesting, I was going to offer to take you along."

Ron's jaw fell open. *Merlin...* "You'd take me?"

"So long as you promised to listen at all times and stay back until told otherwise."

His heart sank. "Mum would never---"

"I'm sure I can talk her around."

"Are you?"

"I am. You need it and she knows that."

The two boys sat in silence for a long time. "Thanks, Bill. I need all this."

***Malfoy Manor***

***1:07 PM***

It felt strange being back at Malfoy Manor. Nearly a month of summer had passed, but finally Harry's friends were all freed up from whatever had been keeping them busy.

Harry was the first to step from the fireplace and was fawned over by Narcissa until Pansy's arrival not long later. The dark-haired girl was practically vibrating with excitement as she chattered away at a hundred words per minute.

Crabbe and Goyle arrived just seconds apart, but the arranged meeting time came and went before Theodore finally stepped from the fire.

*He looks different.* His skin was a touch too pale. His eyes too looked wrong, too blank and guarded.

"Summer taking a lot out of you?" Harry asked, quietly enough so only Theodore would hear whilst they all walked outside.

"Just tired is all." Theodore fidgeted. *He doesn't look tired to me...*

"Quidditch?" Draco asked Harry, Crabbe, and Goyle. *Guess he figures the others won't be interested.*

Harry shot one last glance back at Theodore before agreeing. Theodore must not have expected it because his expression slipped. *Something really is wrong,* Harry thought as he mounted his Nimbus. *I've never seen him look so worried.*

***July 28, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***9:04 AM***

Theodore's expression plagued him those next few days --- mixed with his worries about Grindelwald and half a dozen other things. A string of beautiful days all dawned, bright and vibrant, but none of them washed his worries away.

Those worries were strong this morning, so Harry made his way down to the sitting room to eat breakfast with Regulus, who usually said something interesting to take his mind off things.

This morning, that thing was Quidditch. "I just don't really know anything about professional Quidditch," Harry admitted.

Regulus sipped his tea. "You enjoy the game, though?"

"Yeah."

"You'd love watching professional Quidditch."

"Probably. I've just never had the chance. I don't even know all the teams."

Regulus smirked. "You hardly need to know all the teams. Teams like the Chudley Cannons haven't been relevant in a century."

"Aren't Chudley the orange ones?"

"That's them." Regulus grinned. "See? You know more than you realize."

Harry shrugged. "Not really. Draco just mocked Ron Weasley loads for supporting them."

"Probably one of his better reasons for mocking someone." A shadow passed across Regulus's face. "Your father and his group of friends sometimes went around the halls loudly supporting Chudley for the sake of being contrarians." Regulus shook his head. "That and starting fights."

Harry laughed as Kreacher popped into the room with that morning's mail. Harry's laughter ceased the moment Regulus glanced down towards the *Prophet's* front page.

It was like all the blood vanished from his body for how quickly he paled. His hands trembled so badly he was forced to set down his cup of tea.

*That's not good.* "Regulus, what---"

"I'm sorry, Harry. I'll be in my study. Call for Kreacher if you need anything."

Never had Regulus dismissed him so soundly. It stung worse than expected, but he ignored it and reached for the paper while Regulus rushed off. *What the hell could make him react like that?*

A handsome face stared out at him with eyes so much like his brother's. Long black hair tumbled past his shoulders, grinning like he knew some secret no one else did.

***July 28, 1993***

***Malfoy Manor***

***8:44 PM***

It had been a strange day. Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban had rocked the nation and Regulus remained shut up in his study.

Harry knew who Sirius Black was but found himself feeling disconnected. He had never grown up fearing his name and could not make himself hate a man for killing a dozen muggles. *Maybe I am like Voldemort.*

*No!* he told himself. *There's nothing wrong with hating muggles; you're no Voldemort, you'll be better.*

The day grew stranger when an owl from Narcissa arrived that afternoon. Harry frowned as he read, something felt off. She wanted to meet with him that night. *Why does she sound so worried? It's like she's afraid something big will happen before we meet tonight.*

He was no less perplexed by the time he stepped through roaring green flames and into the Malfoys' opulent manor.

*CRACK!*

Harry's hand drifted towards his wand when he saw the familiar, filthy pillowcase, but he relaxed when he realized this was not Dobby.

"Master be here to see Mistress Narcissa?"

Harry nodded. "She told me to come and talk to her after I was done with everything for the day."

"I be taking you to her now."

They walked through a maze of winding halls that gave way to a large sitting room. Setting sunlight streamed through windows stretching from floor to ceiling, pooling around Narcissa as she paced back and forth. A nervous prick pierced Harry's confusion. *I've never seen her look nervous before.*

"I be bringing the young master to you, Mistress Narcissa."

Harry's nerves hardened when she spun a fraction too fast. *She's jumpy, too.* "I see that. Begone; ensure no one interrupts."

"Is everything all right?" Harry asked once the elf was gone.

"I wish I could tell you that it was."

*She sounds like she expects an explosion, or something.* "What's wrong? Does this have something to do with Sirius Black?"

It was like the fatigue of a long day caught up with her all at once. "Everything."

*Why is she so worried by Black? He's on the same side as her husband.* "What is it? I wouldn't have expected you to be so worried about him."

"It's not him I'm worried about, it's you."

Harry hesitated. *Me?* "How much of what we talked about in the hospital wing did Lord Malfoy tell you?"

"I am aware of the conversation. You know that Lucius faithfully serves the Dark Lord in whatever way he can."

Harry studied her. "He said that the Dark Lord doesn't want me to fear him."

"That's true as far as I know."

"Then why would I need to worry about Sirius Black? Everyone says he was the Dark Lord's lieutenant."

Narcissa twirled a lock of hair around her finger. "Everyone says plenty about situations they know nothing about." Her voice lowered.

"What is there to know? Black killed a wizard and a dozen muggles in broad daylight."

"So did most of the Dark Lord's followers. My own sister did worse before being sent to Azkaban."

"Your sister?"

"Bellatrix Lestrange."

"Oh, right. She was a Black."

Narcissa gazed back out the window. "She was."

"Wasn't she the one arrested for torturing the Longbottoms?" Harry had researched the Longbottoms after Neville's murder in his first year. The story had filled his nightmares until Grindelwald took them over.

"Along with her husband, his brother, and Barty Crouch's son, yes."

His pulse quickened. *She must be using Occlumency. No one looks that calm a few seconds after being so panicked. Merlin, what's going on?* "So what is it about Black that has you so worried if it isn't what he did?"

"Not to the muggles or to Peter Pettigrew." She lowered herself onto one of the couches, hands folded in her lap. "I think it's best if you sit." Harry sat with bated breath. Whatever made her speak so gently must not be good.

"I've told you that your father was part of an infamous group of delinquents whilst at Hogwarts."

Harry nodded slowly. "I remember."

"What I haven't told you was who his friends were."

Dread coiled in the pit of his stomach. "Black was a Gryffindor, wasn't he?" Narcissa nodded. "So Black was friends with my father?"

"Him and Peter Pettigrew, along with another boy named Remus Lupin." She appeared to chew her words. "The reason I didn't tell you is because Black's allegiances in the Purity War were more complicated than most would have you believe."

Harry tilted his head. *Complicated?* "They seem obvious."

"Black wasn't always loyal to the Dark Lord. He was driven from his parents' house as a teen and spent the next few years living with your father."

"So he joined Voldemort after school even though he was friends with my father?" There was something else. This was all new but meaningless. What did he care if his father once lived with a madman who may not yet have been mad?

"The first group Sirius joined was a vigilante organization run by Dumbledore. They were more effective in fighting the Dark Lord than the ministry for most of the war."

"What changed?" It was the only question left, but he dreaded the answer. What could have turned Black away from his best friend and into the open arms of Voldemort?

Narcissa wrung her hands. "No one knows. I'm sure the Dark Lord did before he attacked you, but it's not as though anyone has been able to ask him."

"So he just joined him?"

Narcissa's mask cracked. *Here we go...* "It wasn't that simple."

Harry scowled. *Get to the point.* "None of this seems to be simple."

"I know, but it's going to get worse."

"Just say it."

Narcissa closed her eyes. She looked like a porcelain statue as she pondered. "Have you ever heard of the Fidelius Charm?"

Harry opened his mouth to answer no, then remembered something Dumbledore had once told him.

*"It was much more complicated than that, but yes. It was first sent to Gringotts while I ensured certain protections were in place at the castle. Other things were considered, too. The Fidelius Charm was taken under strong consideration, but I dismissed it. Nicholas has participated in the charm's casting as many times as a person can and I confess, I wanted to save my available usages of it for a later date."*

"I've heard it mentioned. Something about available usages?"

"It's a very complicated spell. It involves two people --- the caster and the secret keeper. The caster casts the spell and it's bound to the secret keeper. Anything the spell is cast on will be hidden so completely that it's impossible to find."

Harry's suspicion rose. *That seems like it would have been a better protection for the stone.* "Why isn't that used all the time?"

"The available usages factor you mentioned plays a part."

"I don't actually know what it means. I just heard someone say it."

Narcissa toyed with her hair again. "It means that no one can be the caster or the secret keeper more than once."

"Wait, what?"

Narcissa shrugged. "The theory is beyond me. Very few witches or wizards have ever successfully cast it."

Harry hated that his first idea was to ask Grindelwald about the spell. He shivered. *Stay on-topic, this is more important right now.* "What about Black? What does this have to do with him?"

"Have you not guessed?" Harry shook his head. A pained look crossed Narcissa's face and unease slithered in his stomach. *This won't be good.* "Your parents went into hiding under the Fidelius Charm. Your mother was the caster and Sirius was the secret keeper."

Numb shock washed over him. It all made sense. Why Narcissa had been so worried, why she had wanted to be the one to tell him, and even why there was so little information about Sirius Black as a Death Eater. This meant...

Heat stirred beneath his skin. "So he betrayed my parents?"

"Yes."

Something was building in the pit of his stomach. Something hot and vile that threatened to burn straight through his flesh and spill out across the floor.

"Why?" was his only question.

"The only one who ever knew was the Dark Lord."

"This was why you wanted to tell me. Because you were afraid if I learned from someone else, I would think... something."

"I don't know what you're thinking now or what you would have thought, but this is a family matter. It should be handled with family, and it should be family who support you."

Harry ran a trembling hand through his hair. His Occlumency wavered. How he craved for the power to suppress his emotions.

"Is there anything else?"

"Are you all right?" Narcissa asked, moving closer.

*No! There's nothing worse than a traitor!* "I just... I need time to think."

"I think it's best if you're not alone."

"We can talk again, I just... is there anything else? I need to go."

"Harry---"

"Tell me!"

Narcissa pulled back. Guilt tried forming in his stomach --- he should never have yelled at her --- but the anger burned it to ash. It was winning, chipping at his defences brick by brick. Soon they would crumble and he would explode; he had to leave.

"Some people think that Black had personal reasons for betraying your father. It would explain why he went after Pettigrew and I've heard it said he would have killed you when he got to the house had Dumbledore's man not beaten him there."

Dumbledore's man had been Hagrid. Harry remembered the giant telling him how he had carried him across the sea the night his parents died.

Then it struck him what Narcissa was saying and he almost exploded right there. This was all too much. First Voldemort, then Grindelwald, and now this? It wasn't fair! None of this was fair! *When will everyone leave me alone?*

Tears stung the corners of his eyes. Every part of him trembled, rage seeping from every pore. "And now Black might come to try and finish the job, whether the Dark Lord wants him to or not."

"He will fail. We're here for you. Me, Lucius, Regulus, Diana, Draco, all of us. No one is going to hurt you --- no matter how hard they try." The tears were no longer silent. It was overwhelming.

He almost leapt from his skin when he felt her touch him. Harry leant back, but Narcissa was faster. She snaked her arms around his back and held him close. He stilled, shivering when cool fingers stroked his hair.

*It's too much.* The shaking worsened as weakness crept through him. His body collapsed and he buried his head in her shoulder, wracked by furious tears.

***July 30, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***The Library***

***2:33 PM***

It had been a long two days.

Harry had not returned home that night, instead sleeping at Malfoy Manor in the room he had occupied the previous summer.

The dreams had been awful.

Dreams of waking to that face looming over him, smiling the way it had in the *Daily Prophet's* photograph before everything vanished in a flash of green light.

Black had consumed his thoughts that next day; angry thoughts that boiled his blood and sent raging shivers up his spine.

*Why?* he'd thought. *I don't get this mad when thinking about Voldemort. Why does Black bother me so much worse?*

Both had played their parts in killing his parents, and both together had doomed him to a decade of hell on Privet Drive. The differences in how he felt about each of them confused him for a time, but it began making sense the longer he pondered.

Voldemort had acted to preserve himself. Harry's existence had been a threat to his own. *I can understand that.* What would he have done had he held the power to kill the Heir of Slytherin when his life was so threatened down in the Chamber of Secrets? *I can't blame him for being paranoid.*

Black's crimes felt more personal. *He betrayed them; he was their friend and he betrayed them.* The thought made him sick. How many times had Harry been betrayed? The Dursleys, Gemma, Draco, Daphne, the list went on and on. Each betrayal cut deep and left scars harsher than the ones carved by his parents' death. *I'll never forgive a traitor.*

Duelling lessons had resumed with Lord Corban Yaxley and he was improving fast. *Not fast enough --- I need to be ready when he comes for me.*

He looked around the library, considering the shadowed shelves with a frown. "*It might be the country's largest collection of books on twisted magic."*

*CRACK!*

Harry's head whipped up as violent fancies faded. "Kreacher?"

"There's a letter, master."

Harry leapt from his seat when he saw the bright orange envelope. Something so lurid could only have come from one man.

*Good day, Harry,*

*I'm afraid I've been quite inundated by letters these past few weeks, so I must apologize for the tardiness of my reply.*

*I will not claim my youth was savoury, nor even shout of blasphemy from the rooftops. Miss Skeeter's book is well-researched, just know that some things have been dressed up for public consumption.*

*Ariana's death was a tragic accident born at the end of a strife-filled summer. I wish Miss Skeeter would have let the dead rest --- there is no honour involving them in politics like this --- but there is certainly some truth in what she writes.*

*Thank you for your concern and I look forward to seeing you back at Hogwarts.*

*Kindest regards,*

*Albus Dumbledore*

*So it's true --- all of it is true.* Dumbledore meant to avoid the question, but he had given enough. *I can't blame him. It's not like he realizes I've already seen the start of that summer and can put the rest together.*

He closed his eyes but opened them the moment Sirius Black's face swam before his vision. *Damn him! I need a distraction!*

A tragic accident, Dumbledore had said? What sort of tragic accident could kill his sister and end a friendship he had once cherished? It was true, then --- it had to be; there was nothing else that explained everything so succinctly.

Grindelwald's pendant felt heavy against his skin, its metal cooler than usual. Or maybe that was just the cold that crept through him any time he considered leaning more on Grindelwald. If there were any doubts the memories were fakes, this disproved them, but giving the once dark lord an inch still unnerved him.

High, cold laughter filled his thoughts. His grip on the letter became vice-like as he closed his eyes. *Grindelwald might not have driven me mad, but thinking about Black for long enough will.*

"I did not expect you."

Harry opened his eyes and stared unblinkingly at Grindelwald. "I want another memory."

Grindelwald studied him. "Another memory?"

"Yes." He hesitated. "There's been a book published. It's about Dumbledore and it talks about what happened that summer."

"And you wish to know whether what it says is true?" Looking at Grindelwald suddenly became much harder, so Harry stared past him and out over the waters of Lake Königssee far below. "I must arrange flowers for the author if her work is what has piqued your interest."

Harry scowled. *Dumbledore is right; she should have left things alone.* "She's probably drowning in them already. Dumbledore has a lot of enemies and people are talking."

"I'm sure it means little to them compared to what it means to me. Their squabbles are petty, your interest might change the world. It is precious beyond anything they will ever own."

The room faded.

***August 4, 1899***

***The Dumbledore Family Home***

***3:21 PM***

Albus watched him for any sign of doubt as he so often did, but he would find none. "You truly mean to do everything you say? To unite the Hallows and then the world under a single banner."

Gellert trembled, excitement coursing through him. "Under the banner of those fit to rule. You have said it yourself. We are ruled by creatures who are made inferior."

"And you understand how difficult that will be?"

*Of course it will be difficult. There would be no need if it was easy.* "Of course it will be difficult, but you know my plans."

Albus gazed out the window. "You can't believe that old tale."

Gellert scoffed. "I think we've both made it clear that we believe the tale."

"But to believe possession of all three Hallows makes one---"

"The Master of Death? No, we both understand how foolish that is."

"Then what---"

*Why does he play these games? He understands this all himself.* "It is not about becoming the Master of Death. Think. Think what we could do with the Death Stick under our command, or with a stone powerful enough to raise armies of the dead."

"It would take decades if it was possible at all."

"Alone, perhaps."

"We've been over this before. You know I can't---"

"Then don't."

Albus blinked. "I beg your pardon?"

"You cannot leave your sister behind because she is too broken by what those muggles did to her." It had been days after first seeing Ariana when Albus explained the truth. All it did was make him surer that Albus would join him. *He must crave it just as deeply --- anything else is impossible.*

"You are correct."

"Then don't. Take her with you. She will be safer with us."

Albus laughed without mirth. "Safer whilst we oppose everything those with power believe in?"

Gellert sneered. "I scoff at their power. Political prestige will mean nothing when the systems that value it are torn to the ground. Magical prowess will mean nothing against us. We are better and you know it; the two most gifted sorcerers in the world. One of us will control the Death Stick whilst the other leads an army of the dead. No amount of might will save them then!"

A faraway look crossed Albus's face. "The cloak."

Gellert frowned. *What?* "What of it?"

"The cloak never fit into our plans."

"Why would it? It grants an ability we already have."

"An ability my sister lacks."

Gellert's chest swelled with glee. "Yes! That's it! See? You have no reason to turn down fate. We are destined to rule; everything fits so smoothly in place."

"Does it?"

Albus leapt from his chair. "Aberforth! What have I told you about entering uninvited?"

The foolish boy glared. "You want to lecture me, Albus? You talk of neglecting Ariana and you want to lecture me?"

"When did I ever---"

"Who would care for her whilst you two chased fame and glory? What would happen when she had an episode? Would the cloak hide her from her own disease?" Gellert clenched the arms of his chair so tight that his knuckles paled. *Fame and glory? Does the boy understand nothing? There would be no need to hide --- his sister would have justice!* "Admit it, Albus! You can't answer."

"There is no question to answer!" Gellert raged. "Think before you speak, boy. Think before you accuse---"

"Gellert, no!"

He glanced to his left and saw that Albus was tense and glaring. His stomach writhed. *How dare he choose that fool!* "Fine. I will leave you to quarrel with this lackwit yourself. Good day, Albus."

"Gellert! Wait!" Gellert had already left the kitchen and was most of the way to the door. He strode from the house without a backwards glance, pausing only when he saw her sitting cross-legged on the front lawn.

She looked up at him but shrank back from his glare, teary-eyed. *How is she so weak? How could such pathetic creatures break her so easily? They tested me and I grew stronger. She's gone through so much less and is frailer than a child.*

***July 31, 1993***

***Malfoy Manor***

***8:36 PM***

Grindelwald's memory had not provided the distraction Harry had hoped for. No longer did he obsess over Black and how he could work towards his destruction, but he was consumed by a new question. *Is it more dangerous to want Black dead, or to sympathize with Grindelwald?*

Harry walked the lawns of Black Manor the morning of his thirteenth birthday, hoping the fresh air and bright sunrise would lift his mood. It helped some, but he was aided more by Regulus, who was waiting for him in the dining room by the time he came back inside. The Lord Black had hidden away since his brother's escape from Azkaban, but today he was all smiles. *It's almost like it never happened.*

The day and its festivities did a better job still at taking his mind off things. A heaping breakfast greeted Harry and his friends at Malfoy Manor, followed by an afternoon out on the grounds playing Quidditch, chasing each other around the lake, and finally lounging near the water's edge.

The water had darkened and become split by a line of fading sunlight by the time they were summoned inside for dinner, joined now by the respective parents and their partners.

The feast left Harry full and sluggish, but presents stirred him just moments later. Books and trinkets dominated the haul, but all that changed when he opened the Malfoys' gift.

"The World Cup?" he asked, his heart fluttering.

"Britain is hosting next summer," Lucius explained. "These were devilishly hard to get ahold of, but I thought you might enjoy attending. I purchased tickets for us as well," he gestured to himself, his wife, and his children.

Harry grinned, glancing at Regulus, who looked a fraction too pleased. *I bet that talk about professional Quidditch was him gauging my interest for Lucius.*

The final gift was from Regulus and it was no chain this year; the box was much too large.

"Open it, then," said Regulus.

Draco gasped aloud when something red and gold rolled out. A second passed during which Harry wondered whether Regulus had pranked him with a Gryffindor-themed gift, but then he saw it.

"What is this?" he asked, running his fingers along the smooth, polished surface of a racing broom with red-coloured twigs. All he knew was the name, printed on the handle in golden letters.

"State-of-the-art racing broom," Regulus said with a grin. *I've never seen him look so happy*. "Some of the top World Cup teams will be using these next year. They're supposed to be miles ahead of any Nimbus and aren't technically in stock yet. Getting ahold of this one was a nightmare."

*Merlin...* "How much did this cost?"

Regulus waved a hand. "I was a seeker. No one is willing to spend more money on a broom than a seeker."

One awkward hug later, he found himself reacquainted with his friends' parents. *Thank Merlin for that portrait's lessons. They must have thought I was an idiot last summer.*

He finally extricated himself and slipped from the room, making for the nearest balcony. *I need some air.*

"Harry!"

Harry's hand drifted towards his wand. He might have jumped had he not recognized the voice. "Draco?"

"Something's wrong."

Harry's eyes narrowed. *I'm too stressed for this right now.* "What do you mean?"

The blond began fidgeting. "Father... he keeps looking at you. I don't know, it's just wrong."

*What is he on about?* "Looking at me?"

Draco wrung his hands. "Yes! It's like... I don't know. It just... I don't know. Something's not right."

Harry's heart fluttered. "What's his expression like? What makes it look wrong?"

"I don't know! He looks exhausted every time and my mother just left about ten minutes ago. They were whispering together when she stormed out. She didn't look pleased. Something's going to happen, but I don't know what."

Harry shifted from foot to foot, his hands on his wand. "What could happen? It's a birthday party."

"I don't know, just... Harry. I'm scared."

"I beg your pardon, masters." The squeaking voice made Draco jump and draw his wand, but it was only a house elf.

"What?" snapped Draco.

"It be Mistress Narcissa, sirs. She wants to see the young master." The elf bobbed its head at Harry. *It looks nervous, too.*

Harry looked from Draco to the elf. Could this be another betrayal? Had Lucius planned this whole thing with his son? *I don't think so. I believe him; he's never been good at hiding things.* Which meant that if Lucius and Narcissa had argued, this summons may be against Lucius's will. *I trust Narcissa more than him. She might be leading me away from whatever trap her husband set.*

"Where is she?" Harry asked.

"I be showing master if he follows me, sir."

Draco grabbed his arm once the elf moved away. "Be careful!"

Harry faked a smile. "Always."

Harry was led down the familiar path of corridors leading to the same room he had met Narcissa in earlier in the week. His nerves calmed some when they reached the room's entrance, but his head had begun aching.

"S-she be inside m-m-master." *What is it with the Malfoys' elves being so nervous about everything?*

Black curtains were drawn across the windows Narcissa had paced near the last time Harry was here. There were no torches or candles; the room was so dark that Harry could barely see the sofa. *This headache isn't helping anything. Merlin, it's getting bad.*

"Narcissa?" he asked as the pain swelled. He shook his head but no relief came, nor did it grow worse. Harry closed his eyes against the pain... the pain that came exclusively from his scar. Oh... *fuck!*

"I'm afraid she won't be joining us."

He clasped his hand over his scar as it exploded with pain. Suddenly he could see better and his head loomed higher, watching the boy shrink back. *Strange. Does my presence pain him?*

Harry forced his mind clear and the pain receded some. He removed a shaking hand and raised his eyes, staring across the room.

A pair of red eyes fractured the darkness, illuminating a chalk-white face that began moving closer...

**Book 3: The Looming of Shadows**

**Chapter 4: Face to Face**

***July 31, 1993***

***Malfoy Manor***

***9:03 PM***

Harry drew his wand but knew it was hopeless. Days had been spent lamenting how he was not yet ready to face Sirius Black, and Voldemort was an entirely different monster.

The Dark Lord chuckled. "Do you mean to kill me, Harry?"

"You killed my parents." He was surprised how calm his voice sounded. "Why shouldn't I?"

"Such childish words, should and shouldn't. Who is to say what you should and shouldn't do? The Ministry of Magic, the most corrupt magical organisation in the country? Is that who you defer to in times like this?"

Harry took a deep breath. "You don't always need to be told---"

"You never need to be told. Not those of us with power. Should and shouldn't, right and wrong; they are cut from the same cloth of lies. Why *should* someone with power bend to the whims of those who are weak? Why *should* they not do what is best for them and instead do what they're told?"

The pain in his scar was still blinding. Harry clamped down harder on his emotions and the pain receded, still present but less violent. It was like he had unblocked a river; his mind was moving again. *Not that it's helping. How can I answer a question I've asked myself before?*

"Lucius Malfoy told me I have no reason to fear you."

"And what do you think?" Voldemort asked, his voice soft and quiet.

*I can hardly think at all.* "It doesn't make any sense."

Harry heard Voldemort move but could still see nothing. *Enough of this; if I'm going to die, it won't be in the dark.* He lit his wand, shocked and horrified by the sight before him. Scarlet eyes stared out from a chalk-white face, bald and noseless. *It's like he's half man, half snake.*

Voldemort spread his hands; skeletal things with long, pale fingers that were like spider legs made only from bone. "Do you see what you have accomplished, Harry?"

"A-accomplished?"

"I have conquered death, yet my defeat still haunts me. This body reminds me every day of what happened that night."

Every nerve screamed for him to run, but he held his ground. Fleeing would result in nothing but death; surely Voldemort would never take that chance. "So why are you talking instead of killing me?"

Voldemort spread his hands. "Magical blood is precious, every spilled drop is a tragedy."

Harry forced down the urge to scowl. "That's never stopped you before. Why should it now?"

"Is that what they've told you?" Voldemort's voice remained quiet but he might as well have shouted for how hard his words hit home. *It's like what Grindelwald said the first time we met. The* Dark Lord looked angry for the first time as he stood, waiting. "Answer me."

"I don't---"

"Is that how they label me? A tyrant who killed for sport and pleasure?"

*He wants the answer, and something tells me lying would be a bad idea.* "Sort of," he admitted.

"Explain," the Dark Lord demanded.

Harry forced himself not to muss his hair. "People's stories are different. No one seems to say the same thing, but most people think that. They say you wanted to kill anyone who wasn't a pureblood."

"Do they now?" Voldemort moved towards the window, pacing back and forth. Harry watched his every step and realized that Voldemort wasn't even looking at him. "Do you remember what I told you the night we met at Hogwarts?"

*How could I forget? That's the night that started everything, the night I started thinking for myself.* "You talked about muggles and how they fear what they don't understand. You mentioned that they were dangerous and that the Statute of Secrecy would fall. You've said it's come close before."

The words were like chalk on his tongue. They had kept him up for days back then, but he had ignored them. Now it was impossible. *How can I ignore them after what I've seen?* A broken girl lay in a pool of snow and blood, disfigured past recognition. Flames crawled up dry wood, licking at the hem of dark robes as a crowd of muggles cried for blood. *He's right --- everything he said about them was right.*

Bile rose in his throat. Why was the world so broken? Why did it make him agree with men like this? Harry wanted it all to go away. Voldemort, Grindelwald, all of it...

*Do you?* a small voice asked. *Do you really want them gone? Look what they're making you.*

"Muggles," hissed Voldemort. "The operative word is muggles. Where in what I told you did I mention the purity of blood?" Harry opened his mouth, but closed it. "Speak your mind," Voldemort commanded. "Now is the time to ask your questions. I will strike you down for none of them."

Wariness remained, but he decided to ask anyway. *Not that I have much choice.* *Sod it, Grindelwald surprised me, maybe he will, too.* "Tell me the truth, then?"

Voldemort ceased his pacing and turned his crimson stare on Harry. "The truth?"

"You seemed upset over what I'd heard about you and the war. Tell me the truth. What should I know? Convince me."

Voldemort's misshapen lips curved into something Harry thought was supposed to be a smile. "I have told you already what I want."

"Tell me more clearly." It was a mark of how far Harry's Occlumency had come that he was able to speak like this. *One wrong word might mean death.*

Voldemort considered him. "I wish to eliminate muggles and the threat they pose. That has always been my goal."

Harry's heart raced, but his voice stayed level. "What about your followers? Most of them were famous blood supremacists."

"What of them?" asked Voldemort.

*He sounds so casual.* "You say that you don't care about blood supremacy, but then you keep them around."

"Why should their opinions matter to me? All I care about is how well they serve. Those witches and wizards pledged themselves to me. I don't track every step they take because I have nothing to fear from them. If the job is done and done well, why should it matter if they go the extra mile?"

*This doesn't add up. Everything I've read says he's a tyrant. At least some people argue Grindelwald meant well.* "What about people like my father?" Harry asked, scrambling for anything to throw at Voldemort. "He was a pureblood and you killed him."

"I did." Voldemort's voice was calm and casual. *Should it bother me how easily he talks about killing them?* Harry had never known their faces back on Privet Drive. *Am I a monster because I don't cry for people I never knew?*

"Why?" he asked, unsure what else to ask.

"They opposed me. There was no malice, only purpose."

*I still think of Privet Drive anytime I look at him, but I can't hate that answer.* How could he hate someone for trying to survive? Harry wondered what he would have done in Voldemort's place, but thinking about it made his skin crawl. "So you only killed them because it helped your cause?"

"Yes."

"And you would do it again, wouldn't you?"

"Of course."

"Then why am I different?"

"Why would you not be?"

"I know about the prophecy." Voldemort's expression remained unchanged. "It said that a child born as the seventh month died would be the one to vanquish you. Dumbledore says you thought it was me, which is why you killed my parents and then attacked me."

Voldemort spread his hands. "And I was right, was I not? You were born as the seventh month died, and just as the prophecy foretold, you vanquished me. That is the end of it; the prophecy has been fulfilled and we are free of its bindings."

Harry's mind blanked. "We're... what?"

"Vanquished, not destroyed. My powers were shattered by magic I never considered. I was weaker than a ghost, scarcely a shadow drifting through distant lands. Does that not sound like I was vanquished? Did the prophecy not already come true?"

"Dumbledore made it sound---"

"Like there was more? Like it was your duty to throw yourself between him and I?" Harry said nothing. "Dumbledore has always been content letting others die. Grindelwald broke Europe while he sat comfortably in an office and marked my essays. I rose up years later and challenged everything he stood for, yet he never fought me. His servants died, but did he ever lift a finger?" Voldemort smiled again --- an image of cruelty that chilled Harry to the bone. "Why would Dumbledore fight now when he has the perfect pawn? One who has already taken a king off the board?"

*That's impossible, Dumbledore would never use me like that...*

*He did leave you with the Dursleys,* a dark voice whispered. *Even now he's admitted that he's not telling you everything. Why not? Does he not trust you, or does he not trust what you would do if he told you?*

*"The Malfoys might view you as a tool, but that doesn't mean all of us do."*

*I won't be used again, not unless I'm getting something out of it.*

"So you still want me to join you?" asked Harry. Thinking of that was easier than contemplating his own paranoia.

Voldemort smiled. "I want it more now than ever."

Harry forced himself to remain calm and ignore the blood rushing in his ears. "Why should I believe you? Why should I believe that it isn't just some plan to kill me?"

Amusement danced in Voldemort's eyes. "Think, Potter. We have been alone in this room with you at my mercy. If I wanted to kill you, you would be dead."

"My mother's sacrifice---"

"Is not all-powerful. There are always ways. I cannot touch you --- fine. I doubt that blessing would stop me from conjuring a storm of fire and burning you alive."

*Stop using logic that I can't just disprove.* "What about you manipulating me? How can I trust you're not doing that?"

Voldemort smiled. "That's better. I have no use for fools." He spread his skeletal arms again. "Ask anything of me and you will have it, so long as it doesn't weaken myself or my cause."

Harry's mind blanked. *He can't be serious.* He cleared his mind at top speed. "So you're bribing me to join you?"

"I am offering you a compromise and giving you a reason to take it. I'm not demanding your loyalty, I am asking for a chance to earn it." *That has to be a lie; Voldemort would never want to earn anything he could just take.* "We want the same things. You will see that soon."

*This sounds too good to be true.* "What if I refuse? What if I run back to Black Manor and write a letter to Dumbledore?"

"Then you die and waste the opportunity of a lifetime." His red eyes gleamed. "There are things I can give you that no one else can, not even Dumbledore."

Harry felt like his breath had frozen solid. Muscles ached each time he breathed. Could he do this? *There's no way he'll just let me take the offer and* *hang around forever. He'll demand my loyalty eventually. How long will he give me?*

He thought of his parents again and what they would think. He imagined their disappointed faces and expected to feel sadness. Instead he felt rage. *If they were worth anything, they'd want the best for me. But is this best? The risk is so high...*

A broken corpse lay in reddening snow, surrounded by discarded rocks and screaming mobs. Wood snapped beneath his feet as white-hot flames licked at the hems of his robes. The world faded, lost to the unimaginable pain of the Cruciatus Curse. A cupboard door slammed and darkness swallowed him, bitterness clawing at his chest.

That was when he decided. *The risk is worth it --- anything to never feel helpless again.*

***August 3, 1993***

***Egypt***

***1:48 PM***

Ron had expected it to be cooler underground, but it was just a different kind of heat. His skin no longer burned, but the air was so thick and stuffy that it was difficult to breathe.

"We're getting closer," said a tall man with dark skin and long black hair.

Bill had kept his word and convinced their mother to let Ron go with him on this job. Ron had half-expected that her mind would change, up until the moment he portkeyed away with Bill. *I still don't know how Bill convinced her.*

They had met up with the others and taken a flying carpet to their excavation site. Ron had never been on a flying carpet and remembered his father complaining that they were illegal back home. *Doesn't beat a broom, but I'd buy one if I could.* A sea of sand spread out beneath them, dotted with small towns and scarce mirages that were there for a heartbeat, then gone.

Bill had rolled up the carpet and shoved it into the bag slung over his shoulder when they'd landed. "Can't you just shrink it down?" Ron had asked.

"No," said Bill. "Altering its properties like that would disturb the runic array. We wouldn't be taking it back with us if I did that."

*I didn't even know what that meant a few weeks ago.* Percy asked Bill runic questions often and Ron had taken to listening in. Most of it was beyond him, but he had gathered some basics. *Wonder what Hermione would say if she knew I was going out of my way to learn stuff.* His bubble of pride popped when he remembered the electives he'd chosen. *Stupid, stupid!*

"It's darker than hell down here," Ron complained in a whisper, squinting through the black void ahead. One of the cursebreakers' wands was lit, but Ron hardly noticed.

"That's typical," Bill explained. "One of the most common wards we deal with is one that blocks light. It's a nightmare to cast, but the Egyptians were *good*."

"Couldn't you, like, I don't know, break it?"

One of Bill's colleagues laughed. Another --- a quiet, older man --- was more serious. "It's not worth the risk. If it's tied into a larger scheme, we could trigger much nastier traps."

"Left or right?" one of the men asked when they came to two branching paths. Sand made up the floor while rough stone of the same colour comprised the walls and ceiling.

"Left," said the man who'd assured them they were getting close. How he knew any of that as they sloped further down into the darkness, Ron knew not.

***August 7, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***10:32 AM***

Harry could hear his robes flapping in the wind as he soared in a great circle around Black Manor. He swerved hard to avoid Regulus, who had been flying the same circle but in the opposite direction.

Harry righted the broom; he had swerved too hard and flown off course. *I thought my Nimbus was responsive. It's like this thing reads my thoughts.*

Regulus signalled for them to land, so they swooped down, touching down just feet from the manor's front door. Both ran hands through windswept hair and grinned.

Few grins had crossed his face these past few days, so lost he was in troubled thoughts. Voldemort's red eyes and pale skin haunted his nightmares, whilst Harry dwelled on that final choice and how it made him feel in his waking moments.

*Not enough... I should feel more, more than just worry it will backfire.* Maybe Grindelwald's visions had done more than he realized. *I still don't want them to stop... oh, Merlin, what's happened to me?*

"What are you thinking?" Regulus asked once the pair stepped inside. Harry made a face; the inner conflict must have shown in his expression.

*If he wants to know, then fine.* "Did you know?"

Regulus frowned. "Know what?"

"Did you know that Voldemort planned to trap me alone on my birthday?"

Regulus paled, but his expression remained calm. "No."

Harry wrung his hands. "You serve him, don't you?"

Regulus stared past Harry and out the nearest window, a far-away look in his dark grey eyes. "I think you knew that already."

*I want to believe him... everything he's ever said seems so honest.* Black Manor was the first home he'd ever known outside of Hogwarts. *I just want this to work out.*

Harry shrugged as casually as he could. "I wanted to see how you answered."

"Clever. If I lied about one, then I lied about the other." Harry nodded. "May I ask whether the Dark Lord asked for your loyalty?"

Harry met his eyes, his stare unblinking. "You swear you didn't know?"

Regulus stared right back. "I swear it."

**Book 3: The Looming of Shadows**

**Chapter 5: Daunting Paths**

***August 6, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***9:33 PM***

Wind rattled the windows, raindrops pounding against the glass. Thunder boomed and Harry looked up from his book. Towering shelves cast long shadows that crawled through pools of flickering torchlight. He had once mistaken those shadows for movements in the corner of his eye, but he had grown used to them.

Until tonight, when all the old ticks returned.

Harry looked out the window to take his mind off things. He could see nothing through heavy sheets of rain but for the tops of distant trees.

He glanced down at his book but grimaced at the first spell. He had stayed away from the more gruesome tomes for over a month, but Voldemort's return changed everything. *I have to be ready. It's the only way I'll ever be free; the only way I won't always be afraid.*

Harry had done well that night and really did believe that Voldemort had no plans of killing him, but he knew that plans could change. The longer he pondered, the clearer his path became. His heart raced just thinking about it --- a long, treacherous path cloaked in death and shadows.

*It's not like I have better options. I could go to Dumbledore, but what would it get me?* House points and less time, he guessed. Would the headmaster still take time to teach him while busy combatting Voldemort? And if he did tell, Voldemort would know... *I hate feeling trapped. I hate being afraid.*

Harry's choices were two pits of vipers, but at least one offered prizes for taking the plunge.

He glanced back down at his book, steeling his nerves.

*Ossio Exploso*

Harry looked from the spell to its diagram, face unchanged by the shifting images of exploding blood and gore. *It doesn't bother me like it would have before.* Harry thought back to a cold, winter's day, stood atop a mountain overlooking Lake Königssee. Gone were the fear and worries about sliding down a slippery slope. All that remained was anger and an iron purpose. *I never want to be like her... I'll never feel helpless again.*

***August 13, 1993***

***Egypt***

***5:57 PM***

Ron looked around one last time. A small village lay behind him, whilst in front, the sand appeared to stretch on forever, covered in long shadows as the sun began setting. A hot breeze blew, kicking up sand that broke against his cloak.

Ron wouldn't miss the sand. It got everywhere and was impossible to clean without magic, but it and the heat were the only things he looked forward to leaving behind.

This trip had been the happiest he'd been since Neville's death. People like Cedric had tried to help, but Bill had done more in three weeks than any of them had in more than a year. Ron found talking with Bill easy. Bill listened and never treated him as if he were made of glass. *I'm gonna miss him.*

A hand landed on his shoulder and he looked up. "You don't look thrilled to leave," said Bill.

Ron swallowed a lump in his throat. "I'd have liked to go on another job or two."

Bill smiled. "Those don't come around all that often, not ones like the last. Most of them would be too dangerous to take you on."

Ron wrung his hands. "But I actually learned stuff this trip --- important stuff, stuff that'll actually help me."

"Study," Bill told him.

Ron grimaced. "It's not the same. I like doing things, not reading about them. I'm good with that sort of stuff and it feels like I was just getting the hang of runes."

Bill raised an eyebrow. "You know you could take them at Hogwarts?"

Self-loathing gnawed at him as he looked down towards the sand. "I can't. We picked our courses ages ago and I chose Care of Magical Creatures and bloody Divination. I just wanted easy classes, I never thought of how useful stuff like runes is."

"You can always ask McGonagall if she can change your timetable."

Ron looked up. "I can?"

Bill let out a long sigh. "She's your Head of House; things like this are exactly what she's there for."

Ron had never thought of it like that. McGonagall had always just been their Transfiguration Professor. *Guess she just doesn't feel like our Head of House compared to Snape running around and giving Slytherins points for breathing.*

"What about Arithmancy? Should I take that, too?"

Bill pursed his lips. "Why do you want to take Ancient Runes?"

Ron scratched his head. "Well, they're dead useful, aren't they?"

"A lot of things are useful. What about their use appeals to you?"

Ron wiped sweat from his forehead. "Wards are important, and you said runes can be used in duels, right?"

"It's an unusual approach, but I've seen it done."

"There you go. I want to take care of myself." His eyes fell back towards the sand. "I want to take care of my friends."

Bill squeezed his shoulder. "Then stick with runes. There's plenty of use for Arithmancy, but it's not the weapon of men who want to fight."

"Ron, hurry!" called his mother, beckoning for him to come back over to where the others gathered around a weathered old saddle.

"Go," said Bill. "Just remember you can write. I'll try and make sure I reply whenever I can."

Ron hugged him before walking off towards the rest of his family, jumping when a hand landed on each of his shoulders.

"Ancient Runes, Ronikins?" Fred asked in a low voice just before they reached their mother.

***August 14, 1993***

***Diagon Alley***

***12:04 PM***

Harry stepped through emerald flames and into a dimly-lit room. A well-dressed waiter rushed over. "Welcome, sir, we..." he trailed off, eyes lingering on Harry's forehead.

*Why does everyone stare? It's just a scar.* "I should be under a reservation made by Lord Lucius Malfoy," he said, ignoring the man's stare.

The waiter swallowed. "Right this way, sir."

Draco and Diana were already waiting for him, as were Crabbe, Goyle, and Cassie. Theodore, Cassius, and Pansy had yet to arrive.

"Pass along my thanks to your father," Harry told Draco when he sat down between Diana and Cassie. Draco smiled, but there was no hint of his usual smugness. *Weird. His father probably spent a fortune on this place, I was sure he'd be insufferable.*

Theodore arrived next. Harry watched him closely. *His smiles look strained.* The Notts were notorious blood supremacists and close with the Malfoys. *Is it Voldemort? Is that why he looks so awful?* Harry shuddered at the thought. Surely Theodore's father would keep him away from all of that.

His eyes flicked towards Cassie. She was the oldest in the room, plus the best duellist. *If anyone in our group's gonna be involved, it's her.* The Yaxleys had never been linked to Voldemort, but that meant little, especially when most of Lord Yaxley's friends had been.

Cassius entered, calm as still water. Pansy too looked normal, if a bit flushed.

"I never thought I'd meet anyone less punctual than Cassius," Diana said when Pansy arrived.

Her nostrils flared. "I was being lectured by my parents."

Theodore smirked; it was the most normal he had looked all summer. "That sounds like a convenient way of saying that makeup took longer than you expected."

Pansy rounded on Cassius. "How long were you here before me?"

He shrugged. "About five minutes."

"See? That's not that bad. What was your excuse?"

Cassius grinned. "Flying."

"Flying?" Pansy asked, whirling back to Diana and Theodore. "You have the nerve to give me grief after his excuse was flying?"

"Flying is a perfectly good reason to be late," Draco said with the hint of a smile, turning his grey-eyed stare on Harry. "Don't you agree?"

"Completely."

Pansy huffed. "You're all menaces. No one's safe from the lot of you."

*Oh, Pansy...* His eyes went from the Malfoy siblings to Theodore, and then to Cassie. *You have no idea how right you might be...*

***Hours later, in Knockturn Alley...***

The day was spent shopping and gossiping.

*"Father thinks it's different than last year,"* Draco had said when asked about their next Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor. *"He doesn't think Dumbledore's playing any games at all; he really does think no one wants the job."*

*"Can you blame them?"* Pansy had asked. *"No one's made it the full year since the late sixties."*

*"Skeeter didn't help anything,"* Diana added. *"She brought even more attention to the curse last year, and I bet her book on Dumbledore hasn't helped."*

*"They say he's going to resign as Chief Warlock tomorrow,"* said Theodore.

*"Do you really think any of it's true?"* Pansy asked. Harry forced down a lump of cold. *More than you know.*

Diana nodded. *"Some of it must be. The details are too fleshed out for them all to be fake, but it's Skeeter, so I'm sure plenty of it is nonsense."*

*"Do you think he was really friends with Grindelwald?"*

Harry schooled his features. He alone knew the truth but would say nothing. Those were questions he wanted no part of.

*"It wouldn't surprise me,"* said Cassie. *"Gifted people connecting is pretty normal. Father's been trying to convince me I should start writing to the Romanov heiress. She's apparently a duelling phenom at Durmstrang."*

*"I've thought about trying to write Viktor Krum,"* Draco admitted.

Harry seized the opening to change topics. *"He's the teenage Quidditch phenom, isn't he?* *The one who got subbed in for Bulgaria's World Cup qualifying matches back in June and hasn't missed a snitch?"*

*"That's him,"* said Cassius. *"He's brilliant --- one of the best I've ever seen."*

Pansy's throat clearing halted their conversation before they could get too carried away. *"And what about Dumbledore and Grindelwald?"*

*Damnit, Pansy.* Harry chewed his words. *Careful. "We know Dumbledore had connections. Wasn't he in contact with Flamel before graduating?"*

*"That much has been known for years."*

The sun had begun setting when Cassie proposed a stroll down Knockturn Alley. Harry's heart had missed a beat. His stare became suspicious. *It's like she waited until it was almost time for my meeting there...*

It was the first time Harry had been to Knockturn Alley without an adult, and the first time at night. The buildings looked ugly and grotesque in the light of day, their displays odd but unimpressive. That changed at night, when most of the alley's light came from its larger and more well-lit neighbour. Things that looked comical before lost their humour and made hairs rise on the back of Harry's neck. He fingered his wand, ready to draw at a moment's notice.

No need had come by the time the sun dipped below the tops of nearby buildings. Harry looked around, heart racing. Most of his friends looked unsurprised when he excused himself. Only Pansy asked after him whilst Crabbe and Goyle looked confused. The others were all hard to read.

Harry moved down the dark and deserted streets alone. Briefly he had considered wearing his cloak, but he had dismissed the idea. *If I can't handle walking down an alley, how will I ever be ready for someone like Black?*

Harry stopped in the shadow of a tall building that looked fit to collapse. Plaster peeled from rotting walls and mould crept across grease-stained windows.

"A charming place, isn't it?"

This time he had warning --- Regulus had given him the invitation days ago --- but still the voice made Harry shiver.

"You look different," he said, turning to face the man he knew was Voldemort. Gone was his chalk-white skin and gleaming red eyes, replaced by a strong jaw and carved, handsome cheekbones.

"Coming here would be ill-advised if I looked the same as when we last met."

"You have a good memory. I doubt I could remember what I looked like years ago well enough to recreate it."

If the comment surprised him, Voldemort showed no signs. "You would be surprised by the things a man remembers."

"Occlumency, right? Something about improving memory recall?"

The Dark Lord smiled. "Or maybe you would be unsurprised. Has Dumbledore begun teaching you Occlumency?"

Harry knew his expression had given him away and saw no reason to lie. "It was the only way he'd tell me the prophecy."

"The old man always liked his secrets." Voldemort raised a hand and Harry could feel... something change. *Weird. It's like the wards in Grindelwald's memory, but I can't sense magic like him.* "Occlumency can be used to recall memories perfectly."

*Bloody hell, that sounds useful.* "Passive Occlumency, I'm guessing?" Voldemort nodded. "I haven't learned any of that yet."

"What would you say if I pointed out that you were using it as we speak?"

*What?* Harry frowned. "Probably that I don't know what you're talking about."

"Any time you force yourself calm or inspect your own emotions, you're using a form of Passive Occlumency." Riddle's blue eyes sparkled. "The form is just less interesting than others you could use."

"What would you do if I asked you for that? If my one request was for you to help me master Occlumency."

Voldemort spread his hands. "I would see you become among the world's best."

A bitter taste coated his tongue. *He and Grindelwald talk the same way. It's like they already know their goals will happen just like they plan.* It was hard not believing them.

Voldemort leant forward. "Is this what you're asking of me?"

"I don't know yet," Harry admitted. "I'm still thinking."

"So you have not yet come to a decision?"

"Not yet." The path looked clear, but that last step was daunting. There was still one thing he planned on doing before taking that leap.

"You have until the summer's end," said Voldemort, turning away from him. Harry watched him step into the shadows and vanish without a sound. *Why does everything have to be so complicated?*

***August 18, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***8:56 PM***

Harry sat atop his bed and peered out the nearest window, lost in thought. *Thinking so much about dark lords can't be healthy.* First it had been Grindelwald with his memories, and now it was Voldemort with his return.

The worst part was that, by now, his thoughts just went in circles. *One choice makes Voldemort an enemy and gives me nothing, the other gives me almost anything I want.* He pulled a face. *So why is choosing so hard?*

Could it be his parents? *I never knew them.* Harry tried imagining their disappointed faces and felt naught but anger. They would want the best for him. *If they turned on me for making the smart choice, then they're not worth thinking about.*

No, his parents\' memory wasn't holding him back. *I'm paranoid and don't know what to ask for. I don't know what could be worth the risk.*

Grindelwald's pendant burned beneath his shirt, yet still it felt icy cold against his skin. *This is mad,* he thought, fingering the pendant.

Long hours had been spent lamenting his lack of freedom. Grindelwald wanted to use him more than anyone. *Why doesn't that bug me if I hate being used so much?* Grindelwald had the decency to be honest, which was one thing, but there were other reasons. *He wants to use me for something good, not just so he can be powerful again.*

It was the one problem he had with Malfoy's manipulations. Harry had gained and would say nothing so long as that continued, but he saw what was really going on.

"I wondered when you would next come."

"But you knew I would." Harry looked across the tower cell, watching the man staring at him from atop his battered cot. *I'm not nervous anymore. The memories are working. That should bother me.*

"I expect your return each time you leave, but always I wonder whether I may be wrong."

Harry swallowed a lump in his throat. "I don't think you'll be wrong any time soon."

A smile split Grindelwald's face. "It gladdens me to know you have considered what I have shown you and that my time has not been wasted." He steepled bone-thin fingers and let his smile fall. "I presume you have something for me to consider tonight."

Harry mussed his hair. "I know you can get things out of the cell if you want." Grindelwald remained still and made no attempts at lying. "If I tell you something important, will it stay a secret?"

"You are my last chance to change the world. I would not throw away that chance and your trust for the sake of gossip."

*Merlin, he's telling the truth, I can feel it.* Harry took a deep breath. "Voldemort is back."

"Back?" Grindelwald asked.

"Back," Harry repeated. "No one knows except a few of his followers."

"And you. How is it you came to know his most treasured secret?"

Harry shifted from foot to foot, a cool breeze blowing through the bars and splaying hair across his forehead. "It's complicated. I'm friends with Lucius Malfoy's kids and he's one of Voldemort's followers. There was a party at his manor, but he set up a meeting between Voldemort and I without me knowing."

"Yet you live."

Harry chewed his lip. "I don't think he wants to kill me."

"Explain." It was the sternest he'd ever heard Grindelwald speak.

Harry drummed shaking fingers against his thigh, deciding where to start. "I met him at the end of my first year. He was a wraith or something---"

"A wraith?"

"Or something. He lost his powers when he couldn't kill me. All he could do was possess people or animals. He possessed a professor and tried stealing the Philosopher's Stone."

Grindelwald took it all in stride. "So be it. What was he like?"

Harry frowned. "Kind of like you, but not. He gave me a speech about how awful muggles were and how the Statute of Secrecy was gonna fall. He could have killed me, but he wanted me to join him."

"And I presume he offered something similar upon your recent reunion?"

"Kind of. He wants a chance to win my trust, sort of like you did, but he's offering me anything I want as long as it doesn't go against any of his plans."

Grindelwald's face was unreadable. "A generous offer. Tell me, what do you think of him?"

That was a very loaded question. "What about him?"

Grindelwald closed his eyes. *He looks sad.* "You have not considered the things I asked you to."

Harry blushed, knots tightening in his stomach. *Why do I feel guilty?* "I have," he argued, "I've just been busy with the chamber and now this."

"You must consider things more closely. What is it you dream of? What differences do you plan to make in the world? Answer those questions and judge the merit of others against your own ambitions." Grindelwald waited for that to sink in. "So I ask you again, what is it you think of Voldemort? What does he intend and what do you think of his plans?"

Harry considered. *He really doesn't make it easy.* "He told me that muggles were dangerous and that they should be feared."

"You have no love for muggles. Less, I imagine, than when we first met." Harry scowled and nodded. He thought he'd known evil on Privet Drive, but now when he thought of muggles, he thought of punctured corpses and burning flesh.

His anger boiled and his hands curled into fists. "But they don't scare me."

"Don't they?"

"No," he insisted. "I just wish we weren't hiding. If they find us, everything that happens will be our fault."

A shadow flashed across Grindelwald's face. "Not ours. I have done everything to ensure us a position of power and, in time, I think you will too."

"Do they scare you?"

Grindelwald scowled. "They scared me the day I stood upon a burning pyre, but scarcely since. They are a threat to our existence and must be treated seriously, but the threat can be handled if only we act."

"I think Voldemort's afraid of them. He talks about the Statute falling like it would be a huge disaster. I think he wants to make sure it never happens."

"He is a fool. Someone so powerful should not be so defeated. Does Slytherin not house the ambitious?"

"So you don't like his plan?"

"His plan is meek and futile. The Statute will fall."

Harry shivered. "How can you be so sure?"

Grindelwald studied him. "I have foreseen it."

"Foreseen it?" Harry asked.

"You sound doubtful."

"I just don't think of Divination much, I guess." The words sounded weak, even to him. *You know of at least one prophecy that's true, why can't there be another?*

"Divination is scarce and unwieldy, but that does not mean it is without merit."

Harry nodded. *That should have been obvious.* "What did you see?"

"A shadow wreathed in fire, standing over their foe's charred corpse. A single hurdle stands between them and salvation, a hurdle beyond them or the weapon they carry despite its great power."

A shiver ran up Harry's spine. *If he was anyone else, I'd call him mad.* "You thought it was you," he said instead.

Grindelwald nodded, peering out the window. "It fit. I obtained a weapon of great power and knew I would one day face my greatest foe again."

"Dumbledore?"

"It could be no other."

Harry fidgeted. "But he beat you."

"Only fools believe they can bend the whims of fate. My naivety made me unworthy and I paid for it dearly."

*Weird way to describe it, unworthy.* "That's why you're helping me, isn't it?" he asked. "You think that could be me."

Grindelwald just shrugged his shoulders. "You or another, it matters not to me. I have long-since learned not to meddle in the affairs of fate. I shall not work to further the vision, I will do only what I think is best for the world."

*Him and his riddles...* "And you think what's best for the world is helping me?"

"I do."

"Then what would you do if you were me? What would you do if Voldemort made you an offer?"

"I would seize the opportunity with great caution, lustful of its rewards but wary of its giver."

A part of him breathed a sigh of relief. *That's what I've been thinking for ages.*

"You wish for something else of me," Grindelwald said, watching him. "Ask it."

Harry let out a long breath, running a hand through his hair. "I don't know what to ask from him. I feel like it should be something I can't get from anyone else. I could ask how he survived the backfiring Killing Curse---"

"He would not tell you."

Harry nodded. "That's what I thought." Frustration gnawed at him. "There's so much I could ask for, but I can't think of anything good."

A strong wind blew through the open window, rattling the bars. "There is something. Something that only Voldemort could give you if the whispers are true."

***August 22, 1993***

***The Black Library***

***3:44 PM***

Harry's mind calmed some after his talk with Grindelwald, but it remained plagued. There was no doubt how he felt about muggles, but talking of plans and opinions had gotten him thinking. What was the best way to handle them? *Grindelwald's sounds better. It can't be that hard to take them over --- we have magic.*

Harder to answer were the questions about Sirius Black. A dozen old copies of the *Daily Prophet* littered the desk in front of him. Lucius had been able to get him every paper that ever mentioned Black, but none had been helpful so far. *Narcissa wasn't kidding --- him switching sides really* does *feel random.*

*CRACK!*

Harry looked up with a sigh. *A break might not be the worst thing.* "Hello, Kreacher."

The elf bowed low. "Someone wishes to see you, young master."

Harry frowned. "Who is it?"

"They be telling Kreacher their name is Nott."

Harry had yet to talk alone with Theodore all summer, but every time they had met, he looked troubled. *This should be interesting.* "Send him in, but take these papers first. Leave them in my room, please."

Kreacher bowed and popped away; the papers vanished with him.

Harry walked to the nearest window and peeled back the curtains. The sun was drifting westward and towards a distant forest. The trees' shadows lengthened the further it sank.

The door opened soundlessly behind him; he could sense it despite hearing nothing.

"You look tired," said Theodore.

Harry rubbed at his eyes. "I haven't slept much," he admitted.

"I'm not surprised." Theodore stepped up beside him. "How are you handling everything?"

"Everything?" Harry asked.

Theodore glanced around the room then lowered his voice to a whisper. "We both know he's back." Harry tensed. *At least that answers the question whether or not he knows. Figures. If there was ever an obvious Death Eater, it's Tiberius Nott.* "There's no point pretending we don't."

His heart beat hard. "What else do you know?" Harry asked.

"What else do *you* know?" Theodore returned.

"Probably more than you." Theodore said nothing. "Fine." Now it was Harry's turn to look around the room despite knowing it was empty but for them and several thousand books. "I probably shouldn't need to say this, but let's keep this between us."

Theodore snorted. "I wouldn't have said anything if that wasn't the plan."

Harry collected his thoughts. *Here goes nothing.* "I know he's back and that he's keeping it quiet, and I know that a few of his followers know but that most don't." He looked away from the window, instead watching Theodore. "What about you?"

Theodore wrung his hands. "I know he's trying to recruit you and hoping for some kind of answer soon. Nothing else, really, besides that they're planning something."

Harry rubbed his eyes. "I doubt they're ever not planning something."

"Father's been gone more the last few weeks and he looks tired any time he's home."

"What happened to his hand?" Harry asked, remembering the glove he'd worn at his birthday party.

Theodore looked away. "I don't know. I haven't seen it since getting home from Hogwarts."

Something about that bothered him. *It's like the answer's on the tip of my tongue, but that makes no sense.* "Any guesses about the plan?"

Theodore looked away again. "Something involving Black, maybe? I doubt it's an accident he broke out right after the Dark Lord's return."

Harry scowled, rage churning inside his stomach. *And here we go again with Black...* "You're worried about me now that Black is out, aren't you?"

"We all are. Black was dangerous. There's a reason he was given life in Azkaban."

"I doubt V-the Dark Lord broke him out." Theodore's eyes were wide, his face pale. *Way to slip; you'll have to clean that up if you plan on taking his offer.* "If the Dark Lord broke him out," Harry went on, "I wouldn't need to worry about him, not if he wanted to recruit me."

"I don't know," said Theodore. "Azkaban's an awful place; most prisoners go mad."

Harry clenched his fists so hard, his palms grew hot. "I'm not afraid of him." All he felt was rage akin to the night Aberforth had made him kill the lamb, the night he had brutalized Cadmus Yaxley and revealed he was a Parselmouth.

Theodore sighed. "You're going to go after him, aren't you? The same way you went after the Heir of Slytherin?"

Harry imagined himself standing over Black, his wand aimed at the traitor's chest. A hungry beast roared inside his stomach, calling for blood. *Merlin, I'm just a kid and he's a murderer. What chance do I have?*

*None yet,* another voice whispered, *but with Grindelwald's help...* "I don't know."

Theodore screwed up his face and reached into the pocket of his robes. "At least take this. It might help."

"What is it?" Harry asked, scanning the blank cover of what looked like a very old book.

"One of the books from our family library." Theodore's voice became a whisper again. "Only Notts know the spells in here."

*So the rumours about old families and their magics are true?* That made the book priceless. "Theodore... you're sure?"

Theodore only nodded.

***August 29, 1993***

***Knockturn Alley***

***9:00 PM***

Voldemort was waiting in the shadow of the same building they had last met beneath. The Dark Lord was once more wearing Tom Riddle's face and drumming his fingers against the building's peeling wall.

"Was I late?" Harry asked, frowning.

"No," said Voldemort, removing his hand from the wall. "It's just that I have never been a patient man."

Harry took a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heart. "I still have questions."

"Ask them. I have waited long enough."

Harry steeled his resolve. "You once told me that you worried about the Statute of Secrecy. How do you plan to make sure it never falls?"

"The first step is seizing the ministry. I can begin severing ties more easily then."

*Severing ties? Does that mean the two governments work together?* Frustration gnawed at him but he kept it down. It was a well-worded answer. "What do you want from me?"

Voldemort tilted his head. "I have told you already. I would like an open mind and an opportunity to convince you my ways are right. I mean to one day offer you a place at my side."

Harry studied him, watching for any signs of deception. "So if I say yes, all you expect is that I keep in touch and listen?"

"I expect much from you, but I will not ask for it yet. Not until a firmer relationship has been agreed to." Harry looked for traps in Voldemort's words. "This agreement does not obligate you to fight for me, nor to take my mark."

Harry cleared his mind, steeling his nerves. *Here we go...* "Then I agree."

Voldemort's eyes gleamed. "Excellent. What is it you ask of me in return?"

***September 1, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***9:24 AM***

Raindrops drummed against the tall windows. It was hard to see much through the stained glass, but every few minutes, lightning would paint the grounds outside in a wash of white. Harry remembered the first day of school last year and how bright it had been. *That year wound up being a mess, so hopefully this is a good sign.* There was Sirius Black to deal with, but better him than Voldemort. Anxiety clamped down hard on his chest. *If he wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already. It's going to work out.*

"It's going to feel different without you," Regulus said, sipping at his tea.

It would feel different; the whole summer had felt different. *It's the first year I wasn't counting down the days until Hogwarts.* "It's gonna be weird leaving." A shadow crossed Regulus's face, aging him ten years. "Is everything all right?"

Regulus put down his glass. "I owe you an apology."

Harry frowned. "An apology for what?"

"The way I've handled my brother's escape from Azkaban."

"I get it," Harry assured him, "you don't need---"

"Yes, I do. You started off wary of me. I felt like I was making good progress, then I handled everything like a brooding child."

"It's all right," said Harry, blushing.

"None of how I've acted was all right," said Regulus. "I'm not your father and I doubt you want me to be, but you are my ward. I had a responsibility and I neglected that." That same shadow lingered atop his face. "Nothing about that is all right. I'm sorry."

*I don't think an adult has ever apologized to me before.* Dumbledore had, but not so plainly. *I think he regrets how the Dursleys acted more than anything. He wasn't sorry for sticking me with muggles.* The thought made him seethe, but the anger cooled while he stared across the table.

"Thank you," he muttered, unsure what else to say.

Regulus pushed hair back from his eyes. "My parents made many mistakes. Neglecting Sirius and I is just one of them, but I won't repeat it. There are things you should know before you leave."

His pulse quickened. "What kind of things?"

"Things that will help you if my brother attacks."

Harry straightened in his chair. "Like how he fights?"

Regulus looked past him and out the large windows, silent until another flash of lightning came and went. "I can't give you much there. Sirius fought for the Order of the Phoenix before I ever joined the Dark Lord."

Harry frowned. "The what?"

"The Order of the Phoenix. It's what Dumbledore called his vigilante group, but that's not important."

Harry made himself nod, quelling a rush of disappointment. "Right, Sirius."

"Sirius isn't the world's best duellist. They say the Dark Lord trained him, and maybe he did, but I doubt that's changed. Your father was better and so was Snape, but my brother could go toe-to-toe with either of them."

"Because he was smarter?" It was the obvious answer.

A sad smile played across Regulus's lips. "Not exactly. My brother was a Black and a Gryffindor. That's a dangerous combination. All our family's ruthless cunning with a stubborn boldness that goes against all of it."

*That just sounds like it contradicts itself.* "I'm not sure what you mean."

"I mean that predicting what Sirius will do is impossible. People like you and I might expect him to lay traps, then he'll jump out and face you in the open before you're ready. Then you'll learn and play on his pride next time, only for him to order a tactical retreat." Regulus pushed away his glass of tea. "My brother was the closest thing I've ever seen to chaos, and there's no predicting that."

*That sounds like a nightmare.* Harry studied Regulus across the table. "I thought you said you never fought him."

"I grew up with him. No one knows him better than me."

Harry remembered what Theodore said the last time they'd talked. "Theodore says Azkaban might have driven him mad."

"Theodore may be right. Sirius might have changed, but not that part of him. Madness can only change a man so much."

*It sounds like he's said that before, or at least thought it.* "So have a plan, but be ready to change it."

"Exactly."

Harry could do that. There had been no plan last year and still he had prevailed. *So what if I had help, I still did it.* There had been first year, but... *I'm better than that now.*

"Is there anything else?" Harry asked, wiping those dark thoughts from his mind.

Regulus's expression grew grim. "Have you ever heard of the term Animagus?"

***About two hours later, on the Hogwarts Express...***

Harry and Theodore made quiet small talk whilst they waited for the others. Draco arrived first, flanked on either side by Crabbe and Goyle. They had grown this summer; Harry had never seen a pair of third years so large.

"You're later than usual," Theodore remarked once Draco sat down.

"Father talked for longer than usual." It was the second time this past week Draco had missed a chance to look smug when talking about his father.

"Bad news?" Harry asked carefully.

Draco looked out the window. "I'll tell you once Pansy gets here."

Pansy arrived just seconds before the train's departure. Harry noticed that her hair and makeup were perfect --- she looked better than he remembered. *Weird, I just saw her in Diagon.* He shrugged it off. His planned meeting with Voldemort had loomed over him all day; he hadn't exactly been at his best.

Draco's lip curled when Pansy walked in. "Would it kill you to be on time?"

She made a face at him then leaned over Harry to place her luggage in the overhead compartment. Their bodies rubbed together. Pansy shifted but it only made it worse. Harry tried leaning away, but Pansy moved again, still fighting with her trunk. *You're over people touching you and she's just putting up her trunk, calm down.* He forced his mind clear and waited for her to finish, fighting down a blush.

"I don't think it would kill *you* not to be insufferable," Pansy snapped back at Draco once she'd finished, now sitting beside Harry.

"Being insufferable is half the fun. Being late just drags everyone down."

Theodore smirked. "Speaking of being insufferable, are you planning anything for Weasley?"

"No."

Theodore raised an eyebrow and Harry too was surprised. *That was a pretty short answer.* "Are you all right, Draco?" Theodore asked. "Do we need to take you to Pomfrey once we get there?"

Draco sneered. "I've grown up, Nott. You should try it sometime."

*That touched a nerve.* "I *still* haven't heard anything about the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher," said Pansy, pouting. *Good timing.*

Everyone looked at Draco. "Father hasn't mentioned anything; I don't think he knows."

"Dumbledore's leaving it late again," said Theodore.

Harry's thoughts drifted towards the memory of two boys and their talks of muggles and Hallows. "I know we talked about it in Diagon, but I bet Skeeter's book hasn't helped."

"That book really is something," Pansy said with a dreamy smile.

Theodore snorted. "You would think so. Skeeter must be your idol."

Pansy clicked her tongue. "I would never pick an idol with such poor fashion sense." She wrinkled her nose. "That jewellery makes me sick, and don't even get me started on the glasses or the hair---"

Harry cut her off. "There was something you wanted to tell us, Draco?"

Draco looked cross. "I'd hoped to wait a bit longer. It isn't pleasant news."

Harry grimaced. "The news I have is probably worse, so we might as well get it all over with."

"If what you have is worse, we're in for a long year."

"The world doesn't have a habit of doing nice things for me."

Pansy swatted Harry on the arm. "Bad joke," she chided.

Harry blushed. "Sorry."

Draco waited for quiet. "There are going to be guards at Hogwarts this year."

"Guards?" Harry asked. "What's so bad about guards?"

Draco grimaced. "I don't mean aurors."

Pansy paled and Theodore looked ill. "You can't mean---"

"Dementors."

Harry picked through his memories. "I don't know much about dementors, just that they guard Azkaban and that the *Prophet* mentioned they were helping aurors look for Black."

Pansy shivered. "They're awful creatures."

"Effective ones, though," said Theodore.

"What is it they actually do?"

Theodore shifted in his chair. "They feed on happiness. Father... well, he was held there after the Dark Lord fell while he waited for a trial."

Harry's eyes narrowed. *That can't be legal.* "They held him in Azkaban to wait for a trial?"

"Don't sound so surprised," Theodore said darkly. "The ministry didn't play fair last war and they knew they'd been infiltrated. Pretty much anyone they thought might be connected to the Dark Lord got that treatment."

"So he's met them first hand then?"

Theodore nodded. "He says the cold is the worst, says there's nothing like it; like your blood turning to icy water."

"I've heard they make people relive their worst memories," Pansy said quietly.

Now it was Harry who shivered. *Bloody hell. I hope Occlumency works against that.* Wylla Nurmen screamed and seeping blood spread slowly across a field of reddening snow.

Draco who nodded. "Father says they've driven men mad."

"But they won't do anything like that to us, right?" Goyle asked.

"That's not how it works," said Crabbe, surprising all of them. He blushed, looking down at the floor. "I like magical creatures."

Theodore made a sweeping gesture. "No, please, go on."

Crabbe's blush deepened. "Dementors don't see. They just kind of feel around and can't tell most people apart."

"And Dumbledore's letting them guard Hogwarts?" *That doesn't sound like him.*

"I don't think old Dumbles had much choice," said Draco. "His influence isn't what it was. That book has done a number on him. He stepped down as Chief Warlock, but some people still want him off the ICW."

"I'm shocked he's still headmaster," said Pansy.

Harry shook his head. "I'm not. Dumbledore would do anything before giving that up." *And Aberforth was right; he has enough titles to give up so people stay happy.*

"I never thought I'd wish that Dumbledore got his way," Theodore said with a scowl.

"Dementors must have a weakness though, right? Like how boggarts can be fought off with the Riddikulus Charm. They'll probably teach us all how to fight them."

Theodore smirked at him; it was a mirthless expression. "I forget how new you are to all this sometimes. It's cute you're so confident."

Dread crept through him. "You mean there's no way to fight them?" *It would explain why no one had escaped before Black, but that can't be right...*

"There's a spell, but they won't teach it. Father mentioned it once and said it was way beyond NEWT-level. Plenty of aurors can't cast it."

"What's the spell?" Harry asked.

"No idea, I just know there is one."

"Do you still think your news is worse?" Draco asked, leaning back in his seat.

Harry winced. "I wish I could say it wasn't, but I think Sirius Black being an Animagus is pretty bad."

Pansy screamed so loudly beside his ear that he smashed his head against the window.

***Meanwhile, in another compartment...***

Ron leant forward, a card between his fingers. The compartment was quiet as he reached out, waiting to see if the pile of cards would explode. Raindrops drummed against the train outside, but Ron focused on the cards. *Come on, come on.*

"Gah!" A small shape lunged, knocking the cards to the floor and pawing Ron's arm aside, rushing towards Scabbers, who tried scampering away. "Get away from him!" Ron yelled, kicking at the cat.

"Don't kick him!" Hermione shouted.

"Then get him the hell away from Scabbers!"

Hermione huffed but scooped Crookshanks off the seat and into her lap. Scabbers trembled beside Ron. Susan hid a giggle behind her hand whilst Hannah looked nervously from Ron to Hermione. Cedric just stared out the window while the cat's large eyes continued watching Scabbers.

***That evening...***

Their mood remained low, unhelped by the view outside. Rain-soaked trees sagged beneath the weight of dripping leaves and grass lay flat against sludge-filled fields.

Only after the trolley lady's appearance and a brief visit from their older friends did the mood lighten.

"What classes are you taking, Harry?" Pansy asked.

"Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, and Care of Magical Creatures."

Theodore raised a hand across the compartment. "I'll see you there."

Pansy pouted. "I'm only going to see you in Care of Magical Creatures."

"You took Divination?" She nodded. Harry had dismissed that class when choosing back in April, but he was less sure now. *Even if Grindelwald's vision is fake, it's hard to argue with him about magic.* He supposed it mattered not; there was no time for him to take a fourth elective.

Draco looked troubled. "I took the same classes as Pansy, but I think I'm going to ask Professor Snape to change my timetable."

Pansy screwed up her face. "To change it?"

Draco nodded, staring out the window. Now they sped beside a muggle road so covered in water that it reflected dark trees and the grey sky above. "I've reconsidered over the summer; Father's had a lot to do with that." Harry eyed his expression. *I'll bet the Chamber of Secrets had more to do with it than his father.*

Crabbe and Goyle were in the same classes as Draco but had no plans of swapping. Guilt twisted inside his stomach each time Harry looked at Crabbe. How could he have known him for two years and only now realized he liked magical creatures? *The most I've ever talked with him is in Potions, and that's just giving instructions.* The guilt sharpened.

The sky outside darkened and their chatter settled down. Dusk fell then gave way to night. The sky ahead was darker; it made Harry feel like they were nearing the mouth of a great, black tunnel.

Draco was sipping his water when the train lurched. It spilled out over the floor and onto Theodore's robes beside him whilst Draco fell into a fit of coughing. Harry paid them no heed. *Something's wrong.*

"We shouldn't be stopping," he muttered, standing to get a better view out the window. "Damn, I can't see a thing."

"Lumos," Pansy slid nearer, pressing her wand against the glass. Harry squinted through the night. It was like the darkness swarmed every ray of light and snuffed it out. It was like staring into the deep sea long past twilight.

*"My brother was a Black and a Gryffindor. That's a dangerous combination. All our family's ruthless cunning with a stubborn boldness that goes against all of it."*

*"I'm not sure what you mean."*

*"I mean that predicting what Sirius will do is impossible. People like you and I might expect him to lay traps, then he'll jump out and face you in the open before you're ready. Then you'll learn and play on his pride next time, only for him to order a tactical retreat. My brother was the closest thing I've ever seen to chaos, and there's no predicting that."*

"Wands out!" Everyone drew their wands. Harry found himself surprised. *I didn't actually think they'd listen.* The words had come unbidden, spoken without thought.

Still he squinted out the window. *Something's out there, I can feel it.* Had Black learned the dementors would be at Hogwarts? Did he think his chances were better now, before they arrived?

Theodore stepped beside him. "It's blacker than Death out there; I don't know how anyone---" he cut himself off; the train's main door had opened.

Harry drew a finger across his lips and silently aimed his wand towards their compartment door. *Let him try; I'll bury him in curses before he casts a spell!*

Someone screamed from further up the train, then there was silence. Harry pricked his ears, waiting for more. Not so much as a footstep came from outside their door, but Harry could sense someone moving outside.

The compartment opened silently and someone stepped across the threshold.

"OSSIO EXPLOSSO!"

The spell slammed against Black's chest. Glee lit inside Harry, burning away all but itself and a sick satisfaction. *Everyone was so worried about him. Azkaban must have made him---*

His mouth fell open. Black continued walking --- no, gliding --- towards him. *It can't be Black,* Harry realized as the pieces came together. A hooded head loomed near the ceiling and its owner moved with inhuman grace.

A long, rattling breath came from beneath the hood. The torches died, Pansy's Lumos charm went out, and cold crept beneath Harry's skin. *A dementor.*

Pansy slumped back into the seat behind her and Theodore stood, frozen and trembling. *Great* --- Theodore had been the most knowledgeable of them when it came to dementors.

Harry looked at the others. Crabbe was slumped on the compartment's floor, his knees pulled up to his chest. Goyle looked lucid but cowered in a corner whilst Draco... *Merlin, he looks bad.* His wand had fallen from nerveless fingers and he trembled worse than any of them.

*"Father says they've driven men mad."*

*Why not me?* Harry stared towards the creature's head. Memories came, but he remained unbroken. Starved nights in his cupboard on Privet Drive, the awful sound when Longbottom's neck snapped, pale snow drinking Wylla Nurmen's dying blood, white-hot flames licking up his legs. His scar throbbed, but he felt little else. *Maybe Grindelwald really did drive me insane and I just didn't realize.*

Harry threw another spell at the dementor. It winked out against its chest, but the monster turned its head towards him. "Leave!"

The dementor cocked its head. It did not retreat, but neither did it advance. Harry stepped forward, brandishing his wand.

The dementor lurched, arms raised wardingly towards Harry. *What the...* There was nothing else for it. "I said leave!"

The dementor glided wordlessly from the compartment. Torches burst back to life and the door slid shut.

Harry sagged back into his seat, wincing and exhausted. Every inch of him felt heavy and his eyelids fluttered beneath his burning scar. *What are the odds? Of course Voldemort just happens to do something big right while I'm in the middle of all this nonsense.*

***September 1, 1993***

***Hogsmeade Station***

***9:09 PM***

The train buzzed with students speculating about the dementor. Harry's friends talked too, but their tones were different.

"Merlin," Theodore breathed in awe, "Harry, you just... I've never seen anything like it."

"That was incredible!" Pansy praised.

Draco had only the strength to nod. *The dementor really got to him.* His scar gave another throb, but Harry ignored it. *Why not me?* he thought for the hundredth time. *I've gone through much worse than Draco.*

The rain was falling hard when they stepped off the train. Thunder boomed and lightning lit the silhouette of Hogwarts in the distance, veiled by heavy sheets of rain.

Harry was grateful for the weather. It offered an escape from the praise and questions since his friends could hardly hear each other, even when nestled in the carriages.

They were all soaked and shivering by the time they finally stepped inside. Harry nearly ran head-first into Weasley being led away by Madam Pomfrey. *What the hell is that about?* He looked over his shoulder to watch and saw that Granger was walking in the wrong direction too, following in the footsteps of Professor McGonagall. *Merlin, what have they gotten into this time?*

"Harry, a word?"

Harry smiled and waved his friends on. "Sure, Cassius, what's up?"

Cassius glanced back over his shoulder and Harry took the hint, picking through the crowd and into the alcove beneath the marble staircase. Harry hissed quietly and the doorknob appeared.

Cassius shivered. "Merlin, that's creepy," he said once they'd entered the passage and closed the door behind them.

Harry rubbed at his scar. The pain had largely faded, but a stubborn prickle remained. "What is?"

"You know... the hissing."

Harry shrugged. "All of Slytherin knows I can do it. There's no point in hiding it so long as only you lot are around."

"I'll get used to it, it might just take a while. When anyone like us thinks about Parseltongue..." The rest went unsaid --- they thought about Voldemort.

"Well, I'm not him."

"I know," said Cassius, looking away, "just... there have been rumours."

*So Cassius really doesn't know.* Harry wondered once more just how many of his friends knew what was happening. "I get it, just don't expect me not to use it."

Cassius gave a nervous half-smile. "Yeah, of course. How are you holding up?"

Harry frowned. "Me?"

"Yeah, you know... the dementor. It got me pretty good and I think we've both been through some stuff. I just figured..." he let his voice trail off.

*Cassius might be the best friend I have.* No one else had ever checked on him this way --- no one but Diana, whose loyalties remained unsure. "It didn't seem to affect me," he admitted.

Cassius looked puzzled. "Didn't affect you?"

"I don't know how else to say it. It got to everyone else, but I was fine. Colder than hell until Crabbe told us to eat some chocolate, but that was about it." Cassius looked pensive. "I know Occlumency, maybe that was it."

Cassius wiped stray drops of water from his brow. "Maybe. I've only ever heard of Occlumency, so I can't say much. You figure some of the prisoners would know it, though, and they say dementors get to all of them in the end."

*It makes no sense.* "It was only in the compartment for a minute. Maybe it would have gotten to me if it stayed longer."

Cassius nodded, but he was still frowning. "We should get to the feast. No good to miss the sorting and all that."

They slipped silently into the hall partway through the sorting. A thousand plates and goblets gleamed beneath the cloud-filled ceiling. The ghosts appeared brighter than usual against the bleakness outside; all except the Bloody Baron, who stood silent as ever.

"Did I miss anything interesting?" Harry asked, sitting between Theodore and Pansy.

Pansy yawned. "A few new first years, but no one that interesting. Millicent's younger brother, Arthur, the Avery heir, and one other. Daphne's---"

"Greengrass, Astoria!"

Pansy cut herself off; there was no need to finish.

Harry watched Astoria's path towards the stool. Her head was high but he noticed her shoulders shaking and saw that her hands were in her robes. Her hair was darker than her sister's and she was shorter than Daphne had been at that age.

Harry felt the stare and turned, meeting narrow, sapphire eyes. Her hand gripped the table's edge, knuckles white against the emerald cloth. *She doesn't like the idea of me being around her sister.*

Harry smiled mockingly then turned back around just in time for the hat to shout "SLYTHERIN!"

*Interesting,* Harry thought, watching Astoria walk across the hall. Daphne's betrayal still weighed heavily in his thoughts. Watching her sister brought all those feelings back. *She probably hates me; Merlin only knows what Daphne's told her.* But if she didn't...

A Macnair, a Rowle, and a Thicknesse joined Slytherin. Harry recognized the first two names, and Pansy mentioned that there was a rising ministry official named Thicknesse working in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.

The sorting concluded when a dark-haired girl named Romilda Vane was sorted into Gryffindor.

Dumbledore rose from the staff table, but the hall did not quiet. A wall of chatter wafted through the hall, breaking against Dumbledore like snow against the castle walls. *I've never seen anyone look so unbothered by something like this.*

"We are a restless bunch tonight," Dumbledore said once quiet prevailed. "I will not try and hold back the tide. Let the merrymaking begin!"

The scents of beef and bacon intermingled with the smell of gravy, fresh fruit, and a dozen other unnamed things. They all wafted through the hall, hanging in the air like the rain-filled clouds outside. Chatter soon erupted, whistling through the room like a gusting wind, taking all decorum with it.

"You never did explain what happened with her," Pansy whispered in Harry's ear, jerking her head towards Daphne.

Harry swallowed a mouthful of mashed potatoes. "I'd rather not."

Pansy made large, puppy eyes. "Please?"

Harry sighed. He had planned to keep his friends out of it since he doubted Daphne would involve them, but Pansy talked with her often. *She has the right to know.* "She tried poisoning me in November, then rigged an exploding statue later in the year."

Pansy clamped a hand to her mouth. "What? Why?"

Harry scowled. "She thought I was the Heir of Slytherin."

"Then why was she still glaring at you? She knows that isn't true now."

That was an interesting question, but Harry thought he knew. *She's so sure she's right, just like Voldemort and Grindelwald.* Daphne would never be their equal with a wand, but she was probably the smartest witch at Hogwarts. *Anyone that smart is always so sure they're right.* Harry had learned that while dealing with the two dark lords.

"I guess you'd have to ask her," he said instead, sawing at his steak.

Pansy huffed. "I don't think I will."

"You're friends, aren't you?" Harry asked without looking up.

"We *were* friends, but not anymore." She smiled. "You were always better than her."

"That girl could be the world's greatest spy if she learned to hold her tongue," Theodore said while Pansy visited with other friends further up the table.

Draco set down his goblet. "I don't think she could. She's too emotional."

Theodore laughed. "Look who's talking, Draco."

Draco sneered. "I told you already, I've grown up. She hasn't yet, and neither have you. You learn from your mistakes once you do."

Theodore sneered right back. "Some of us don't need to transform ourselves to be decent human beings."

Harry ignored them, focusing on the food. *I feel like a fat slob or something.* No one around him was eating half so much. Then he remembered the dementor and wondered again why he had been so unaffected.

Pansy soon returned, vibrating with excitement. "Have you heard?" she asked them.

"Heard what?" asked Theodore.

"About Weasley?"

Draco yawned. "Which one? There are about a dozen of them and I don't expect that woman's done making more."

"Oh, cut it out, you know which one I'm talking about."

"King Weasley?" Theodore asked, smirking. Many Slytherins had taken to calling Ron that after his fumbled catch during their Quidditch match last November.

"Yes, him."

Draco scowled. "I can't say I've cared enough to pay attention. Why? Should I have heard something?"

Pansy giggled. "He had a fit on the train; he fell off his seat and everything! The big, bad Quidditch star was afraid of the dementor! Someone even told me he wet himself!"

Harry ignored them again. Never before had he played these games and he would not start now --- certainly not whilst remembering a night sitting out near the Black Lake. *I don't remember them being so cocky when the dementor walked in, and Weasley has a better reason to be afraid.*

The food vanished, replaced by desserts of all names. Harry smelt chocolate, cinnamon, and a dozen other things that he could name. The hall grew louder in the minutes to come, reenergized by the sugar. Crabbe had limped through dinner all night, clearly still plagued by the dementor's effects, but he burned through dessert with a fervour that Dudley would have envied.

Harry looked away. *No one should have that much in their mouth at once.* He looked up at the staff table and noticed only one difference. A man in tattered robes sat beside Professor McGonagall, his hair streaked with grey. Harry frowned. *Is he the new professor?* The man looked like someone he would stumble across in Knockturn Alley.

Harry tapped Pansy on the shoulder. "Who's that?" he asked, pointing.

"He must be the new Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor."

"I gathered that. I was wondering if you knew who he was."

"Oh," she blushed. "I don't think I've ever seen him before."

"It doesn't matter," said Theodore, who must have been eavesdropping. "Dumbledore will tell us soon enough."

The desserts vanished not five minutes later, taking the gilded plates and goblets with them.

This time the hall quieted more quickly when Dumbledore stood. "Welcome! I sense you are wearier than usual, so I shan't keep you long.

"First years should note that the forest on the edge of the grounds is called the Forbidden Forest for a reason. It is not a place to be trifled with and anyone caught sneaking through it will be punished.

"Those interested in playing for their House Quidditch teams should present themselves to their heads of house by the end of next week. Tryouts will be arranged by your respective captains sometime this month. I look forward to a full and exciting year of Quidditch after its forced cancellation last May."

One of the Weasley twins whooped from the Gryffindor table and soon the hall was filled with raucous applause.

Dumbledore smiled. "I hope you're as enthusiastic for your new professor." Quiet muttering replaced the cheers and Dumbledore waited for silence before continuing. "This year, Professor Lupin will be taking on the daunting prospect of teaching you all Defence Against the Dark Arts."

There was polite applause, but nothing like the stir Aberforth's hiring had caused last year.

"On to less pleasant news. As you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are here on Ministry of Magic business." *He really isn't happy; he went out of his way to make sure we know it wasn't his fault.*

"They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds," Dumbledore continued, "and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises --- or even invisibility cloaks." Harry kept his expression still.

"It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors."

Ringing silence rang through the hall. Not even the Weasley twins stirred.

Dumbledore smiled again. "Now, you are all weary and I fear that I have troubled you. Off to bed with you all."

Harry stepped up beside Draco whilst they moved towards the stone steps leading down into the dungeons. "You actually respect him, don't you?"

"Who?" Draco whispered back, glancing around them. The only ones nearby were the rest of their friends, but they had fallen several paces back.

"Weasley."

Draco sneered, but it looked half-hearted. "Something like that," he muttered, looking away and slowing his stride so that the others caught up.

"Excuse me?"

A tall girl blocked their path. *Not that tall,* Harry realized, eyeing the Head Girl badge on her chest, *just older.*

"Yes?"

"You're Harry Potter, right?" *As if she doesn't know.* He nodded. "I've been told to give this to you." Harry took the offered parchment, wondering why she, of all people, had been sent to pass it on.

*Harry,*

*It would be my pleasure to speak with you this Friday evening if you would indulge an old man and his whims. We have much to discuss with such a chaotic year ahead of us and I think it would behoove both of us to do so promptly.*

*Yours truly,*

*Albus Dumbledore*

*PS: After many years of procrastination, I have finally tried and taken a liking to Fizzing Whizbees!*

Harry nearly snorted. Someone as brilliant as Dumbledore was bound to have some quirks, but Merlin, did that man ever have his.

***August 19, 1899***

***The Dumbledore Family Home***

***11:33 AM***

That morning dawned brightly. Leaves bathed in warm sunlight beneath a deep-blue sky and the grass was soft underfoot. Everything appeared starker in this sunlight; the grass was greener, the trees more lush, and the sky a perfect shade of blue.

None of it made Gellert regret their plans. They would leave on the morrow and head for France, where Nicholas Flamel had arranged Albus a meeting with the French Minister for Magic.

The man knew naught what Albus planned to say, nor that a friend would accompany him. That had been when Gellert knew he'd won. *Albus would not risk that connection if he was anything less than devoted.*

*"There is no better place to start,"* Albus had said. *"We must try to win world powers to our side with words."*

Gellert would have agreed to anything. It had taken time to convince Albus this was their only course. The world would be better for it, but Albus thought too often of the smaller problems that their pursuit would fix in time.

Everything was decided. Albus's siblings would stay with a friend he'd met at school --- a strange fellow named Elphias Doge. Aberforth had raged, but Albus had not wavered. Gellert had smiled at Aberforth just before he left the room. *Foolishness never wins.*

"I can't believe we're leaving," Albus muttered, looking up and over the tops of distant trees.

"The time has come," Gellert said with reverence.

"Part of me still wonders how you convinced me."

Gellert smirked. "You knew that I was right. Little convincing was needed." It was untrue, but better to let Albus believe. *His recent decisiveness does him credit.*

A door slammed behind them. Gellert tensed but kept his eyes forward until Albus gasped beside him.

He turned his head. The fool boy was back, but that was not what stilled Gellert's heart. *No! This can't happen!* The girl hung limply in his arms, mouth ajar and pale strands of hair splayed across her forehead. Panic seized him, but not for the child. *No... not now, not this close.*

"Aberforth!" Albus rushed forward and took the girl from his arms. "What happened?"

"Your plans are dead, you won't be running off with him." Aberforth spat the last word like it was something foul, glaring at Gellert over his brother's shoulder. *The mounting anger pours from him in a last-ditch attempt.* Nothing scared him worse than the idea that it might just work.

*He cannot be allowed to ruin this.* "You watch your tongue, you hear me?" Gellert spat back, his blood pumping. "Do not ever---"

"Gellert! That's enough!" Gellert growled then fell silent. Albus looked up, still kneeling over his sister. "Explain yourself, Aberforth."

"Explain myself?!" the boy raged, spit flying. "Look at her! Does she look prepared for the care of your dim-witted friend?"

Albus took a deep breath. "Elphias is sharper than you realize. You will speak of him with respect---"

"I will speak how I choose!" The boy was shaking now, soundless tears rolling down his cheeks. Gellert's stomach nodded, but not for the boy.

"Aberforth, listen to me---"

"No, Albus! I've listened long enough. Look where it's gotten us! LOOK AT HER!" Albus's eyes fell towards his sister and Gellert watched his shoulders sag. "You know I can't control her during the fits. This is your fault. You must stay behind and care for her. Her death will be on your hands if you leave."

"You go too far!" Gellert roared, drawing his wand. "Your incompetence should shackle no one."

The boy's own wand appeared in his hand. "It isn't about competence, Grindelwald! Albus has practised, I can't---"

"Excuses!" Aberforth's hand trembled and his wand's tip sparked. *Give me a reason, you worm.*

"Excuses? Is that what you'll tell your victims' families?"

Albus looked up. "Aberforth! You will hold your tongue!"

"No," said Gellert, "go on."

"You would watch my sister rot if it got you an ounce of what you wanted. No one means anything compared to your goals. You know nothing of love; all you know is greed and dominance."

"Aberforth!" snapped Albus. "I said that's enough!"

"No," said Gellert, his voice low, "he's right."

Albus's eyes swivelled towards him. "Gellert... you can't mean that."

Gellert banished the last of his restraint. *I can't believe this is happening.* "If love is what shackles you and blinds your brother, then he is right, I know nothing of love."

"See?" Aberforth shouted, brandishing his wand. "He admits it!"

"Not to all of it. You think I wish death upon your sister? Her state means more to me than you will ever understand. It represents our failure. Every fit she has pulls at my heart and makes me wonder why I wait here and do nothing."

"You don't care!" Aberforth hissed. "It's all about you and your ambitions."

"My ambitions dwarf all; everything I do is for the greater good."

Half a dozen curses leapt towards him, but Gellert cast wordless counters and they sparked out before reaching him. Another spell built in the boy's wand, but Gellert flicked his hand and knocked him flat against the grass.

"Stop this!" cried Albus, his voice cracking like weathered stone.

Aberforth sucked in a long breath, rising from the grass. "No! He dies here!"

Gellert neutralized the boy's next spell. An invisible whip cracked and the child went sprawling again. *Pathetic.* Gellert readied his wand.

The boy lunged. "AVADA---"

"CRUCIO!"

He cast without thinking, unprepared to hear the Killing Curse's first verse. The Unforgivable plucked Aberforth from mid-air. For a moment he hung --- suspended and thrashing --- before falling to the grass, writhing like a snake with its tail caught beneath a hunter's boot.

Blood thundered in Gellert's ears. *Let him suffer; let him learn what it is to play with the Unforgivable Curses.*

A rocky spire jutted up between them, breaking his concentration.

Gellert turned slowly, facing a familiar face whose wand was trained on him. "Leave."

Ice seeped through his veins. *He can't take his side.* "Did you not hear the spell your brother---"

"I said leave, Gellert. You've done enough."

*You bastard!* Something shattered inside his chest. "Our plans---"

"Can wait --- if they still go on at all. Just... go."

Silence hung between them but for their robes flapping in a late-summer's breeze. "You would abandon our ambitions?"

Pain slashed across Albus's face. "They are my family, Gellert. I can't just leave them."

"And what of the muggles who did this to your family?"

"Ariana's accident was our fault. If we had been more careful---"

"YOUR INCOMPETENCE IS NOT THE POINT!" Gellert hated him! A hundred daggers buried themselves hilt deep in his chest. *Why does it hurt so much?* He took a deep, shuddering breath. "I loved you." Silent tears stung his eyes and blurred his vision. "We were to unite the Hallows and become Masters of Death. My life's work, Albus; I was willing to share this with you."

Gellert saw the pain in his best friend's eyes, saw Albus steeling himself for what would come next. "I was mistaken to agree. I will no longer be part of your plans, Grindelwald."

The knives burned inside his chest. "Then we duel."

"No!"

*You've made your choice.* "Fight me!"

"NO!" Albus slipped his wand back up his sleeve. "Go!"

Gellert studied him, the heat still eating at his chest. "You would let me leave, knowing what I plan?"

Albus stared back at him. "Yes."

His hands curled into fists. "The weaklings will ask for your aid. We will meet again."

The wind blew strands of auburn hair across his friend's forehead. "Perhaps."

Gellert closed his eyes and snuffed the building heat. "We end this now."

"No."

"Yes." Aberforth crawled out from behind the jutting stone, clutching at the hem of his brother's robes. "Albus, listen to what he's saying. We should take him. Together, we could do it."

"No."

Gellert levelled his wand at Albus, his sister's slowly stirring body the only thing between them. "Arm yourself, Dumbledore!" Albus remained still. "Arm yourself now!"

Albus looked away. "I will not fight you, Gellert."

His heartstrings tugged. *Must I do this?* "Fine; have it your way." Gellert let his wand's tip fall, now aimed down at Ariana. "Crucio."

The girl screamed and Albus drew his wand. Gellert ended the spell. The spire exploded. Shrapnel intercepted Gellert's curses then burst into flame, pelting back towards him.

Gellert banished himself a dozen feet back and thrust his wand above his head. The fire streamed skyward, now a single molten sphere that fell towards Albus like a shooting star.

Grass burned and stone smouldered, giving way beneath the fire. A flaming tornado surrounded the spot where Albus had stood, sending waves of heat rippling out in all directions.

Gellert lowered his wand, wincing as his skin stiffened against the heat. Something panged inside his stomach, raising bile to his throat. White-hot needles prodded at his cheeks. He turned to leave. "No!" Aberforth screamed. "You bastard!"

"It is finished." Sweat rolled down Gellert's face.

"Like hell it is!"

Gellert spun and batted away the first curse. Spells flew back and forth until Aberforth was blasted back again. Gellert sneered down at him, this creature who had ruined everything. Green light seeped from the end of his wand, the curse building.

The blazing twister broke apart, sent skyward for a second time. Gellert whirled just in time to see it vanish in the waiting maw of a dragon made entirely from water, looming higher than the houses or trees. The dragon collapsed, rolling towards him in a single, destructive wave. It slammed against a silver shield that wavered. Gellert strained and grimaced.

The water reared back, once more a roaring dragon preparing to strike.

*This is no animation. This is Drochuisc*. Fear gnawed at him for the first time that day. *One of the four elemental incarnations of hatred --- I thought them no more than myths.*

Gellert grunted and slowed time.

*Thump, thump!*

Not truly, but close enough. His mind processed things inhumanly swift in this state so that everything around him appeared to crawl. It was a perilous trick and he dared only use it in times like these; when eye-blinks could be the difference between life and death.

*Thump, thump!*

*Five heartbeats --- I dare not risk longer.* His shock ebbed. *Better.* Never had he expected something like this. *If one exists, they all must.* Four meaningless incantations, or so he'd thought. *Albus has greater control than I; my counter must be swift.*

*Thump, thump!*

The world sped back up. "TALAMHOLC!"

Stones cracked with a sound like thunder and a hundred monsters crawled from the earth, made of stone and clay.

The dragon lunged but was met halfway. Gellert's face twisted with pain. It was like the spell was tearing him apart.

Gellert snarled and swept his wand outwards, forcing the spell into a solid mass of earth and stone that absorbed the dragon's strike, then curled around it. Both spells broke; sopping earth crumbled like sand at high tide and water sloshed out across the yard. Tree-sized stones hit the ground so hard it trembled, but Gellert looked past all of that.

Albus stood facing him, wand outstretched. Both of them were flushed and gasping, but Gellert attacked; a simple barrage of curses fired off in quick succession. *I cannot win a game of control; I must beat him this way.* The two exchanged curses so fast that Gellert lost track of whose spells were whose.

Footsteps pounded near. His earlier fear returned. *I must end this quickly; I cannot beat both of them.*

"AVADA KEDAVRA!"

Green light leapt hungrily from the tip of Gellert's wand, but the nearest wall split off and intercepted the spell. The stone shattered into a hundred shards that hung --- momentarily suspended between him and Albus --- some of them blazing.

Gellert dilated again, seeking gaps in the stones through which to fire curses. It was imprecise work; there was no telling whether the stones would fall faster than his spells could move.

He let the world speed up again and fired at the same time as Albus. His aim was true and sailed through a pair of stones that obscured his rival's view. A single spell slipped through a different pair of stones, hissing towards Gellert, who raised his wand.

A shrill scream filled the warm, summer air and a small body slumped against the sopping grass.

The duel ended with her heartbeat. Albus dropped his wand and lurched forward, cradling his sister's lifeless corpse. *She's dead; I saw that spell.* Albus knew it too, though Gellert knew he had not seen it. *I should kill him; he might wonder if I did it, his wrath would be fierce.*

Gellert raised his wand, aiming past the spot where Aberforth sat gaping and towards his brother's back. He could hear the words inside his head, but they melted on his tongue each time he tried saying them. *He could die never knowing that he killed her; there would be mercy in that.* Still his hand shook and now tears stung his eyes again.

*I'm sorry, Albus, for your loss and for the future. It will be harder this way.* The blue sky faded as he whirled, leaving Godric's Hollow far behind him.

***September 2, 1993***

***The Great Hall***

***8:36 AM***

Harry was accustomed to being the first awake, but Theodore had risen first that morning. Harry ignored his stare as he hurriedly dressed, preparing for breakfast. *At least he woke me before the others noticed I was still asleep.*

Harry cast his mind back to last night's vision as they moved up towards the Great Hall. *How did Skeeter get so much right?* Some of the details might be wrong, but it was incredible. *No one's known any of this for almost a hundred years, but she just fished all of it up in a few months?*

Harry moved on; some mysteries would never be solved. The duel had been incredible and he could hardly blame Grindelwald for snapping. *Merlin knows how good an agitator Aberforth is.* The only thing that bothered him was the one thing Skeeter had gotten wrong.

***The previous night...***

The pockmarked grass and sun-kissed sky faded. "You look well."

"You didn't expect me to, did you?" Harry asked, opening his eyes to see a familiar tower cell.

Grindelwald tilted his head. "I was unsure. You have changed these past months."

"It would have made me sick a year ago," said Harry, walking towards the barred window and looking out. It was a long way to the mountain's peak and further still to the waters of Lake Königssee far below it.

"And what does it do now?" Grindelwald asked, watching him, hands folded atop his chest. *It reminds me of how Dumbledore stands sometimes.*

"The Cruciatus Curse on Ariana... that was the bit I didn't like." *Only one bit that bothered me... I really am changing.* All he could do was hope it was for the best.

"It was regrettable." *He sounds like he means it.* "I administered a small fraction of the curse's power and only for a heartbeat. It was impulsive and immoral, I was not thinking clearly."

Harry shook his head. "You recovered fast. That duel... I've never seen anything like it. I wish I could fight that way. I wouldn't have to let other people control everything and just go along with it."

"You will learn." Harry nodded, still peering out the room's lone window. "You doubt me?"

His face twisted into a grimace. "Some of that magic... it just feels impossible." Harry turned back towards Grindelwald. "What is Fiendfyre?"

Grindelwald stood still. "What inspired this question?"

"You compared the water Dumbledore conjured to something you thought of as Fiendfyre, but I've never heard of it."

"I am unsurprised. It is among the most evil of magics."

*Evil? Weird word for him to use.* Harry chewed his words. "I didn't think you considered any magic evil. Haven't dark lords in the past always said magic is just magic?"

"I am no dark lord, I act for the world." Harry nodded; it's not like there was much else to do. "Their words are true, when taken in most forms. I generally believe it is the application of the thing which can be morally categorized and not the thing itself."

"But you called Fiendfyre evil?"

"I did."

"Why?"

"Fiendfyre is unlike other magic. It is autonomous. It is hatred given form; its only purpose is to destroy."

"You thought something like that about the spell you used to counter the water. Something about how much destruction it would cause if you couldn't control it."

Grindelwald rubbed at his temples. "Its function is the same. Fiendfyre, Drochuisc, Talamholc, and Sgriosàile --- the four elemental incarnations of hatred. I call them evil because, in their purest forms, they are manifestations of blind malevolence."

Harry found himself leaning forward. "But they can be controlled?"

"Only by the exceptionally skilled. They were called myths for centuries due to their scarcity. It takes a uniquely gifted magician to master any of them."

Harry imagined roaring winds buffeting wine-red fire and water surging up through broken earth. "What about all of them?"

"It is impossible."

Harry frowned. "Why?"

Grindelwald chewed his words. "Aristotle believed everything was made from elements later named for him. This is, of course, untrue, but his beliefs are not unfounded."

"What do you mean?" The best way to get answers from Grindelwald was to ask a leading question, then listen.

"It is the belief of many that magic found its roots in the creative mind. Some believe that things once sprung into being to match how we perceived the world. Those who support this idea often cite that the creation process is the root of all magic and claim that what we use today is the same force that has been weakened by time and stagnation."

Harry took that in; it was a mad idea. *It all sounds nuts.* "What do you think?"

"There is merit in the idea. Magic and its capacity to create may well be linked to the beginning of all things. I am more sceptical of the idea that it once worked so fluidly, subconscious thought brought concepts into existence, but the truth matters very little. What is important is that the Aristotelian elements are often linked back to this concept."

"Why?" Harry asked again, not yet seeing a connection.

"Because it is said certain kinds of people more often imagined, and therefore created, some elements more than others. None of this matters, in truth. It is commonly viewed as a folktale used to justify our shortcomings. The truth is that one magician can only ever wield two of them. One cannot wield opposing elements."

Harry pondered for a moment. "So if someone could use air and fire, they wouldn't be able to use earth and water?"

Grindelwald waved a hand. "Their use in most conventional magics would be unchanged, but they would be unable to wield them as incarnations of hatred."

"So your two were earth and fire?"

"Yes, my affinities were for earth and fire."

"And Dumbledore?"

"Water and earth, though I suspect that may have changed in later years."

Harry raised his eyebrows. "Affinities can change?"

"I have never known it to happen, but one's Patronus can change and that is the purest representation of the caster one can imagine."

Harry rolled his eyes. "You keep just assuming I know these spells you're talking about."

Grindelwald smiled. "I am using terminology you are unfamiliar with in the hope of fostering further questions."

*Git. At least he's honest.* "Fine. What's a Patronus?"

"A Patronus is the result of the Patronus Charm, the only known defence against dementors."

Harry perked up. "They're at Hogwarts this year."

Grindelwald unfolded his hands. "Dementors are posted at a school?"

Harry took a deep breath, trying to ignore the rage bubbling up beneath his skin. "Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban. He betrayed Dumbledore and my parents in the last war. He sold their location to Voldemort, then joined him. Some say he was his lieutenant near the end. No one knows for sure, but either way, he's dangerous; the only man ever to escape from Azkaban."

Grindelwald's eyes were like blue ice. "You ought to tell me things of this nature."

"Why?" Harry asked. "It's not like you can do anything about it whilst locked up here."

"I need not do anything at all. I need only to prepare you for what may come."

***Back in the present...***

It was hard not being happy with the talk they'd had despite how the image of Grindelwald's wand trained on Ariana made him feel. *That happened a hundred years ago, there's nothing to be done. Focus on yourself.*

The best way of serving himself was working with Grindelwald. The thought still made him nervous, but it was the only path forward. *How else will I ever get free? People using me is helping me now, but it won't always. I need power.*

Harry had said as much to Grindelwald, who had agreed to help him. *"I will help only so long as you continue making the best of my teachings. Laziness will not be tolerated --- lazy men do not change the world.*"

Grindelwald's first lecture had been on non-verbal casting. Harry was to master it by Samhain, which he thought sounded insane. *That's in the sixth-year curriculum and Cassie told me half of them struggle. How am I supposed to do it?* But he had not complained; that was another thing he doubted Grindelwald would tolerate. *At least I know some Occlumency, he said that would help.*

Timetables were soon passed around. Harry looked down at his. It was much fuller than it had been last year. *There's no way I could have taken Divination; it's literally impossible.* That first day alone, they had Transfiguration and Defence Against the Dark Arts in the morning, Care of Magical Creatures immediately after lunch, and then an Arithmancy double to end the day.

Divination would remain untaken. Harry had begun studying some Ancient Runes last year after Daphne demonstrated just how useful they could be. They proved both fascinating and versatile. *Not a subject I'd give up.* Then there was Arithmancy, a fundamental component of magic involved in things like Alchemy and Spell Creation. *I can't give that up, either.* Care of Magical Creatures was the least intriguing of the three, but with dementors at Hogwarts, it felt more important than ever. *Grindelwald can talk about Divination all he wants; I made the right choices.*

When the last of them finished breakfast, Harry and his group began moving towards the Great Hall's exit.

"Potter!"

*Must he do this on the first day?* Harry schooled his features before he turned around. *I won't give Snape any more reasons to make my life a pain.* "Professor?"

"Come." Snape strode off towards the stone steps leading into the dungeons, gesturing for him to follow.

"We'll tell McGonagall where you are," Pansy promised before moving off with Draco, Theodore, Crabbe, and Goyle.

Harry and Snape left the noise-filled hall behind. They walked in silence past the decoy corridor and the Slytherin common room, their footsteps echoing against the stone walls, floors, and ceilings until they reached Snape's office.

It was as dark and dingy a place as Harry remembered. The only noticeable difference was that Snape had acquired several more jars over the summer, each of them filled with a new slimy something Harry did not recognize.

"It is your lucky day, Potter."

*It doesn't feel like it right now.* Surely Snape would only ever say that to mock him. "What do you mean, Professor?"

Snape screwed up his face. *It's like he's trying not to curse me.* "You are an exceptional student --- exceptional enough that you are being bestowed a unique honour." His lip curled. "I personally consider this madness and think it will only inflate your ego further, but choices like these are beyond my authority."

*He's really not happy.* "What honour, sir?"

The professor waved his wand and a desk drawer slid open. Snape withdrew an odd device Harry had never seen before ---something resembling an hourglass hanging from an ornate chain. *It's mechanical though, or something like it. Weird.*

"Do you know what this is, Potter?"

"No, sir."

"This is a time turner. Its function is as advertised. Anyone in possession of this device or any like it will have, at their disposal, a mechanism capable of traversing time itself."

Awe washed over him, all semblances of Occlumency forgotten. "Sir, are you telling me this lets whoever's wearing it travel through time?"

"In a sense." *He really doesn't sound happy. Not that I can blame him --- why would anyone give these to a student?*

"Sir, do I understand right that you're going to give this to me?" Snape nodded curtly. "Why do Hogwarts students get time turners? That seems mental."

Snape's lip curled. "I'm glad to see there is still some sense left in that overinflated head of yours. Rest assured, Potter, that these are not given out lightly. You are one of two Hogwarts students this year being given one. You two will be the first students ever given these devices."

"Ever, sir?"

"Yes, Potter, ever; must I repeat myself so often?"

Harry grasped for control of his mind. *Must you be such an utter twat?* "Sorry, sir, it's just... a lot."

"These are a relatively new discovery made by the Department of Mysteries. There have been several propositions made over the past number of years for Hogwarts students to receive them, but they have all been denied." Snape looked like he was chewing on a lemon. "The Granger girl was granted one this year on the account of her wishing to take extra classes. She was deemed an exceptional student and served as an ideal opportunity for these devices to be tested in an educational setting. I was... displeased by the development."

"Because you don't think students should be given time turners?"

"I am quite correct in saying they should not be, but the bulk of my displeasure came when I heard who would be receiving one." Snape fixed him with his dark-eyed stare. "You are an attention-seeking brat completely lacking in common sense and void of any survival instincts, but it is you who stands atop your year, not Granger."

*So that's why he agreed. He can't stand Gryffindor winning, even if I gain from them not. It's so petty*, he almost laughed.

Snape lifted the time turner, but his grip around its chain remained firm. "It should go without saying that you will be monitored more closely than usual and questioned regularly about your usage of this."

Harry nodded, mind racing with a hundred new prospects. *I can really do it. Between this and Grindelwald, I can work towards being free.* "Yes, sir."

"The time turner may not be used to retake tests or exams, nor in any competitive environment such as Quidditch. If you leave the castle during the spring or winter breaks, the time turner will remain behind with me." Snape stared into his eyes. "Am I understood?"

Harry nodded. "Yes, sir."

"I should dissuade any delusions you may have about bending time to your whims before you try something foolish. The time turner works safely only in one-hour increments. One full turn of the hourglass will transport you back one hour into the past, and back is the only direction you can travel." Harry nodded to show that he was following.

"I am legally bound to inform you that this device should only be used in order to attend extra classes and complete the necessary course material," Snape's lip curled again, "but I am not foolish enough to believe you will follow such restrictions. Instead I will tell you that those who meddle with time rarely find kind fates. No one has travelled further back than six hours. Seven is theoretically possible, but you would be a greater fool than even your father if you tried."

"So only go back a few hours at a time, at most?"

"At most. This is not a toy, Potter, and it has other consequences."

*Here comes the catch.* "What sorts of consequences, Professor?"

"The time turner allows you to be in two places simultaneously. If you travel back in time, two of you will exist before the past version of yourself takes the time turner back, as you did."

Harry swallowed hard. *This sounds like one of Dudley's cartoons.* "I'm guessing I probably don't want to run into the duplicate of myself?"

"Doing so would be ill-thought. You should also avoid others realizing there are two of you. No one is to know of this, not even your closest friends."

*It's weird agreeing with Snape, but he's right about that part. Draco would probably go run his mouth about it.* "I understand."

"There is more than the possibility of colliding with an alternative version of yourself. The time turner does not duplicate you. It instead divides, leaving your mind and body reeling under twice the strain. This is the price you pay for time."

*That could be a problem.*

"I'm warning you, Potter, misuse of this device will be severely punished."

Harry nodded one last time, reaching out as Snape finally handed him the time turner, its metal cold against his skin. "I understand, sir."

***That evening...***

Hermione's eyelids drooped, the scarlet curtains flickering in and out of sight as she scratched Crookshanks behind the ear. Her head lulled and the necklace swung, its metal cold against her skin.

That was what jolted her. She cupped the hourglass and held it up to her face, staring down and battling the storm raging inside her.

*This is stupid! This is so stupid! Why is everything in this world stupid!* The Philosopher's Stone left in a school, aurors uninvolved in fighting threats against children, dementors at Hogwarts, and now this? *How am I ever supposed to be comfortable in a world that makes no sense? Everything is broken!*

Hardly anything worked the way it should. Couldn't they all see that? Couldn't the adults do something about it? Almost everything needed fixing and the world would operate a whole lot smoother if people just slowed down and used basic common sense.

But on the other hand...

A time turner, resting in the palm of her hand. *I can do things with this... so much is possible.* She almost gasped, struck by sudden inspiration. *This is it! This is my chance! I can use this. I'll use it to get ahead --- so far ahead that, by the time I graduate, they'll have to listen*. There was hope yet --- if no one else would fix things, then Hermione would do it herself.

***The Headmaster's Office***

***8:00 PM***

Harry examined his own emotions as he climbed the spiral staircase. Pleasant memories came with this climb, but so too did knowing long-buried secrets. *Why does what he did that summer bug me more than what Grindelwald did?* It all came back to treachery. *Dumbledore was willing to leave his family... I could never do that.*

"Enter," Dumbledore called once Harry knocked upon his door. The office remained unchanged but for the headmaster's desk, upon which lay the largest pile of parchment Harry had ever seen .

"Busy start to your year, sir?" he asked, taking the seat across from Dumbledore.

Dumbledore shoved aside a sheet of parchment. "You could say that, yes. Dementors on the grounds of Hogwarts come with much paperwork. Funny that the one tasked with said work is the one who opposed their presence from the beginning."

"My friends said you wouldn't like dementors at Hogwarts. They were surprised to see them here at all."

A shadow passed across Dumbledore's face. "They were correct. I have no love for beasts who know nothing but treachery and despair. Cornelius\'s assurances do little to appease me."

"Do you think the dementors are working with Black, or something?"

The headmaster's lips thinned. "No. The dementors will not spare Sirius Black, not now that he has escaped. I doubt even Lord Voldemort could convince them otherwise."

*Careful with this next one.* "But you think Voldemort is coming back?"

Dumbledore looked old all of a sudden. "I believe that his return is inevitable, whenever it may come." He peered out his office window towards the clear night sky. "I fear that day of reckoning may not be so distant. There have been rumblings."

*Dumbledore really doesn't miss much.* Harry hoped he remained ignorant. Things could get very complicated if Dumbledore learned of Voldemort's return. *Caught between the two most powerful wizards in the world... that doesn't sound fun.*

"I believe that's enough talk of dementors and Voldemort," Dumbledore decided. "We have much to discuss. How has your return to classes treated you?"

"We haven't done much except for Divination and Care of Magical Creatures yesterday, plus a double period in Potions earlier today."

"What do you think of your new classes? I heard that Silvanus began his class this year with hippogriffs; such beautiful creatures, they are."

Harry smiled in memory. "It was my favourite class so far. Crabbe thought he might be starting us too fast, but it all worked out."

"Professor Kettleburn has always been fond of grand beginnings. I eagerly await the stories of each new year. What of the others?"

Harry chewed his lip. "I don't know about Divination." That was a lie. *I know it's a complete and total waste of time with that idiot teaching.* All she had done was predict his death by staring into some tea leaves. *Even Grindelwald thinks she's a joke.*

"It has never been my favourite subject." Harry remembered Dumbledore saying that while talking with Grindelwald and suppressed a shudder. "Not many have the gift. Do not take any failures too harshly, and do try and forgive Sybil's eccentricities. She is a kind-hearted woman who means well."

"Yes, sir." There was nothing else to say. *I'll just keep my insults nonverbal.*

"Divination took place during the same time as Arithmancy yesterday, did it not?" Harry nodded. "So you have used the time turner?"

"I did. It was... weird."

"Is it true that those who use them feel no connection to their alternative self?"

"If Snape hadn't told me how it worked---"

"Professor Snape, Harry."

Harry's eye twitched, but went on. "If Professor Snape hadn't told me how it worked, I would never have realized there was another one of me at all." A grimace marred his face. "Until that night. I crashed really hard."

Dumbledore nodded. "That is unsurprising. Professor Snape and I are of the belief that Occlumency can be used to augment your mind in a way that may lessen the strain it undergoes."

"Thought streams, right?"

"Your knowledge has expanded since last we met."

Harry wanted to curse the moment the question left his lips. *Idiot! Voldemort is the one who mentioned that!* "I read about them this summer. There are a few books on it in the Black family library."

"I see." Harry tried gauging Dumbledore's mood, but it was impossible. "I should have known curiosity would get the best of you. Your Occlumency is impressive for one so young. You continued the prescribed exercises over the summer?"

"Yes, sir. They've been helping; I can feel the difference."

"Good. I will no longer keep Passive Occlumency from you, but I do ask that attempted alterations of your own mind be done only while instructed and supervised until you have a grasp on the necessary concepts."

Harry fought a smile. *I'll have supervision, it might just not be what you have in mind.* "Of course, sir."

"I was referring to thought streams, as you guessed. They are, at first, exhausting, but become much less so with time. We believe their usage may reduce the strain caused by the time turner."

"So are we going to test the theory?"

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "You will be testing it later this year so long as you gain proficiency with the technique, though I am afraid I will not be aiding you."

Harry frowned. "But you just asked me not to do those sorts of things without proper instruction."

"And you will have it, just not from me. I will be passing the duty of teaching you Occlumency onto Professor Snape this year."

Harry stiffened. "What? But, sir---"

Dumbledore held up a hand. "Please let me explain." Harry reluctantly sat back in his chair. "Professor Snape is more gifted an occlumens than I will ever be. I feared him too impatient to instruct a beginner, but you are past that stage now. I believe he will be a better instructor than I. It would be selfish of me not to do what I feel is best for you."

"What if I'd still prefer you teach me? Headmaster, you must know that he and I don't get along."

"I am not unaware. It is another reason why I believe this to be wise."

Harry chose his next words carefully. "Sir, I don't mean to be rude, but that sounds completely backwards."

"Does it? We have already discussed Voldemort's inevitable return. Both you and Professor Snape have strong reasons to oppose him. Is it not wise ensuring the two of you can coexist before that trying day comes?"

Guilt clawed at his stomach, but he batted it away. *You're doing what's best for you. That's it. There's nothing wrong with that.* "I guess so, sir."

"Fear not, I won't neglect you this year. We will continue our lessons, they will simply cease being focused on Occlumency."

Harry perked back up. "What will you be teaching me, sir?"

"It is my hope that I will teach you how better to handle yourself in the event that Sirius Black or similarly interested parties gain access to you."

Harry's eyes lit up. "You're going to teach me how to fight?"

"Slowly but surely. We will begin with me teaching you Transfiguration and see how much of the curriculum we can get through. I believe you are ahead already?"

Harry nodded. "I'm probably somewhere into the fourth-year curriculum. I haven't pushed myself as hard in Transfiguration as I have in something like Defence Against the Dark Arts."

"All the better. All it means is that you do not yet understand your potential. I think you will soon surprise yourself."

**Author's Endnote:**

**I can see you all typing away about how foolish it is to include time turners and I understand your concern. They are beyond broken canonically. That is one of the reasons I am including them --- I want to see if I can provide at least a little bit of balance and logic to something so broken. You can see the foundations of that balance in this chapter already. I will promise right now that time turners will not become a major plot device, and that you will not see any moments of import suddenly undone. Their inclusion is a personal challenge to myself; that's really about it.**

**I should also point out that, due to his year-long stay in Azkaban, Hagrid did not get the Care of Magical Creatures position. There's no good way of explaining that in-world since, from the characters' perspectives, him not getting it is normal so they have no reason to ponder it.**

***September 6, 1993***

***The Great Hall***

***12:11 PM***

Harry felt energized at lunch when he entered the Great Hall flanked by Theodore and Pansy. Their last lesson before lunch had been Charms and Harry had stayed behind to ask some more advanced questions. Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle had gone on ahead, but Theodore and Pansy had waited.

Harry and the others had entered that morning to find a blazing sun smiling down at them from the enchanted ceiling far above. It was the first bit of sun any of them had seen since their arrival at Hogwarts. Harry had heard some students muttering about how the dementors had brought with them a perpetual downpour of rain and gloom.

Between the bright weather and their last Charms lesson, Harry was feeling better than he had in days. Flitwick was one of the first professors to let them cast magic instead of slogging through reviews of last year's curriculum, or in the case of Harry's new classes, teaching the basics.

*Or doing whatever the hell Trelawney's doing. What a waste of time. I'd feel cheated if I didn't get a time turner...* Snape had wanted him to take all the classes, but he had refused to sit through Muggle Studies. They had argued, but Harry had won. His four classes were still impossible without the time turner, so there hadn't been much Snape could say. *Guess it means I can't drop Divination, though. Pity.*

Harry's eyes sought out Granger. She was sitting with Weasley and looked unchanged. *Figures, the year's barely started.* It would be interesting to watch the strain on her this year. *She's taking more classes than me and probably doesn't know Occlumency. We'll see how worth it these time turners are.*

"What took you so long?" Draco asked once Harry took his seat.

"I was just asking Flitwick something about a spell we'll learn later this year."

"What was it?"

Harry frowned. *Weird, Draco's never been interested in this stuff.* "I know we'll learn the Cheering Charm this year, so I asked if there was a spell that did the opposite. I think it was the dementors that made me think of it."

Draco pushed away his half-eaten plate. "And what did he say?"

"He said we won't be learning any charms like that."

Draco scowled. "So he didn't answer the question."

"Not really, but I bet there is. He would have just said no if not."

"There is," Theodore said quietly. "It's a curse, not a charm. I'm not surprised Flitwick didn't tell you."

"How do you know that?" Draco asked, his scowl deepening.

Theodore looked around, ensuring others were occupied in their own discussions. "I don't know the incantation or what it's actually called, but Father's always called it the Suicide Curse." Hairs stood up on the back of Harry's neck. *This sounds lovely...* "Grindelwald made it famous in the twenties and thirties. It's how he got rid of a bunch of high-ranking officials who opposed him."

Harry kept his composure, but barely. *Why does that surprise me? Why does every awful thing I hear about Grindelwald surprise me?* Was it because of seeing his past? Had Harry grown too close to him? Had he begun overlooking everything he had done? *I'll get more context soon; he'll definitely show me stuff from the war.*

Draco twirled a fork between his fingers. "I've never heard of it."

"I'm not surprised. I don't recall you having ancestors who fought on Grindelwald's side."

Harry nearly dropped his own fork. *The Notts fought for Grindelwald? Why?* They were among the harshest blood supremacists in Britain and Grindelwald viewed all magicians as equals. *They must have seen an advantage in it somewhere. I'll ask Grindelwald about it; that and the Suicide Curse.*

"If you're all quite finished," said Pansy, sliding back into her spot beside Harry, who blinked; he hadn't realised she had left. "I have gossip."

Draco rolled his eyes. "You always have gossip. No offence, but I personally don't care who was caught in a broom cupboard by the patrols last night."

Pansy sneered at him. "I'll have you know that no one was caught last night, thank you very much, and that this gossip is more up your alley."

"Go on, then," Draco said with a long, suffering sigh. Harry bit his tongue. *He really is a jerk to Pansy. I know he's joking a lot of the time, but he never shuts up.*

"We're going to be fighting boggarts today."

Draco really did drop his fork and Theodore nearly cut himself with the knife he was holding. "What?" he asked, putting the knife aside.

"That's what Lupin has done so far with all the third years. We have his class today, don't we?"

"Right after lunch," Harry confirmed, mind racing.

"A boggart?" Theodore asked, casting his eyes about the Great Hall. *It's like he's looking for a way out.* "Is he mad?"

"He's something," sneered Draco. "I doubt anyone who dresses like that can be sensible."

Harry looked away, remembering the rags he'd worn on Privet Drive. *No. That's over, you're never going back. Think about other things.* The first thing he thought about was fighting a boggart; that was hardly any better.

"How's it going to work?" Theodore asked Pansy. "Are we going to wait out in the hall or something while one of us fights the boggart at a time?"

Pansy chewed her lip. "The others all fought the boggart in the same room, one after the other. They're all talking about each others' fears."

Harry imitated Draco in sneering. *Bloody hell, he really is mad.*

***About an hour later, in the Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom...***

Lupin's classroom was more like Aberforth's than Quirrell's. The walls were bare and his desk was empty but for a stack of parchment. The curtains were pulled back and sunlight spilled through the large glass windows, leaving bright pools on the otherwise empty walls.

Lupin shuffled some parchment then set it down atop his desk. Draco had a point; never had Harry seen a professor look so unfit for the job. His robes were tattered and fraying at the edges, all colour long lost from them. His skin was thin and pale, his hair patched and greying.

Lupin had hardly finished taking the roll when Theodore's hand went up. Lupin raised an eyebrow and pointed to him. "I've heard a rumour that you plan to have us face a boggart."

The professor furrowed his brow. "Whoever passed it along is well-informed."

"So it's true?"

"That's the plan for today, yes."

"Isn't that unsafe?" Greengrass asked.

*Here we go.* Harry sat back and watched. Lupin frowned. "Unsafe?"

"Being thrown at a boggart just seems extreme. What happens if someone reacts poorly? What happens if the experience leads to trauma?"

Harry resisted the urge to glare. *Why must I agree with her? Why can't she just be wrong for once in her life?*

Lupin looked unperturbed. "Boggarts can elicit some strong reactions, but that's exactly why I think it's important to cover them."

Greengrass chewed her lip. "That sounds somewhat counterintuitive, Professor."

"Does it? I would think you'd rather first meet a boggart in a classroom than at random whilst unprepared." Greengrass had no answer for that. "Are there any other objections?"

"I heard you made the others face the boggart in front of the class," said Theodore.

Lupin's lips thinned. "I did."

"I won't do that."

The professor shrugged. "I can't force you to. You may leave if you'd like, but it will be covered on the end-of-year exam and you may want the preparation."

"You really mean to have us face our darkest fears in front of the entire class?" Draco asked with his trademark sneer. "Do you realize how dimwitted that is?"

Lupin appeared frustrated now, fingering the tears along the edges of his robe. "Have you ever thought to consider that I might have my own reasons for overlooking those risks?"

"Did you ever stop to consider that some of us may actually have gone through traumatic experiences we don't want others knowing about?" Greengrass asked.

"I will not have any of you face a boggart alone." Lupin's tone became sharp for the first time. "I understand why some of you may be concerned, but this is the only way I feel comfortable conducting this lesson.

"The more of you there are on hand, the more confused the boggart will be." Greengrass backed down again. Draco muttered something about his father under his breath. "Tell him if you wish," said Lupin, "I'm sure he knows that boggarts rarely take the forms of more serious fears." Harry blinked. *How the hell did he hear that?*

"What do you mean?" Greengrass asked.

"Boggarts become a manifestation of fear, but not always the fear itself. It's easy for a boggart to become a spider when faced with someone who's arachnophobic. It's harder for a boggart to match deeper fears like failure because that doesn't have a single form. I think some of you might be surprised at how little your boggarts actually give away."

Lupin offered them all one final chance to leave. When no one took it, he led them into the staff room. It was large, dark with its curtains drawn and empty but for the class and a cabinet that rattled violently when they entered.

Harry eyed the cabinet. *What is my boggart*? The question had plagued him since lunch, but he had no answers.

Years ago it would have been Vernon, but he was past that now. Many children may fear Voldemort, but Harry knew his boggart would not be the Dark Lord. *Wylla Nurmen, maybe? That feels more like what it would have been last year.*

Harry still had no inkling by the time Millicent Bulstrode faced the boggart. It became a bloodless corpse, its eyes dark, chalk-white hands outstretched. Davis's boggart was a pair of dead bodies belonging to two people who could only be her parents, whilst Moon's became a rabid werewolf.

Harry was beginning to realize by the time the first of his friends moved forward that he would face the boggart unaware. *It doesn't matter; I got* *through Privet Drive, this will be nothing.*

Harry had just enough time to see crimson eyes frame a snake-like face before Lupin stepped in front of Goyle and the boggart became something round and silver. *The moon? Why would he be afraid of the moon*. The better question was why Goyle would be afraid of Voldemort. *I expected people would, but not purebloods whose parents were probably Death Eaters.*

The line of students thinned. Pansy's boggart was tame after Goyle's --- herself, but skeletally thin and wearing robes that made Lupin look well-dressed. Zabini was next, faced with the corpse of a beautiful woman.

Theodore hid a snicker. "The Black Widow's son is afraid of his mother's death? How ironic."

Crabbe's boggart was taller and bulkier than he was, but it resembled him so closely that Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was afraid of himself. Then he realized it must be his father. He made fists so tight that his nails bit at his palms.

This he could empathize with. *It would have been my guardians if we did this two years ago*. A sick part of him was glad, not for Crabbe's pain, but for his own empathy. *I'm changing, but not in bad ways. I can still feel sorry for people --- Grindelwald isn't brainwashing me, or anything.*

Crabbe's hand shook so violently that his wand looked fit to fall from loosely clutching fingers. *It's like when the dementor walked in.* Harry wondered how many dementors Lupin had seen in these lessons. *Not that it will be mine... that whole thing still makes no sense.*

"Next!" Lupin called, realizing Crabbe's plight. Harry stepped forward, but Draco was faster. His legs trembled, but his head remained high. *His might be a dementor,* Harry thought, but then dismissed it. *Probably upsetting his father, or something.*

The boggart was at least as tall as Lucius, but its hair and eyes were too dark, its skin too pale.

Harry restrained a gasp --- Draco's boggart was Tom Riddle.

Draco's arm halted, his wand half-raised. Riddle smiled, holding up his hand. A ring gleamed on his finger, etched with something Harry could not read, blinded by torchlight sparkling off a deep, green emerald.

"RIDDIKULUS!" Blue flashed so brightly that, for a moment, Harry could see nothing at all. When it faded, Riddle remained, kneeling at Draco's feet with his head bowed and wearing house-elf garb.

*Riddle... Draco's afraid of Riddle*. What did that mean? Was it just because of how close they'd come to death, or was there more?

*"Boggarts become a manifestation of fear, but not always the fear itself. It's easy for a boggart to become a spider when faced with someone who's arachnophobic. It's harder for a boggart to match deeper fears like failure because that doesn't have a single form. I think some of you might be surprised at how little your boggarts give away."*

*It could mean a hundred things.*

Harry leant forward when Greengrass faced the boggart. It still sickened him just looking at her. If the last year had taught him anything, it was how much he loathed treachery. *Not to mention she tried killing me... I'll get her for that.*

A young girl screamed, pulling out clumps of brown hair whilst her face twisted in agony. Greengrass waved her wand and there was a flash of blue light, then the girl was smiling, the light of laughter in her eyes. *She looks familiar.*

"Her sister," Pansy whispered in his ear. She had come back around after facing her boggart.

Harry could have smacked himself. That was where he had seen her. *So what? She's afraid of her sister being in pain?* Something told him that was wrong and that this was another less literal boggart. *She didn't want me seeing it, that must be why she pressed Lupin so hard.* A smile split his face. *That's it, that's how I get back at her.* It would need more thought. *I won't hurt a little girl, but there must be another way.*

Theodore moved towards the boggart, his footsteps echoing in the otherwise silent room. He was the final student in line aside from Harry. *What is his boggart? He looks awful.*

The boggart changed. Hovering just feet from Theodore was a green skull from whose mouth protruded a serpent --- Theodore's worst fear was the Dark Mark.

*Why? His father's a Death Eater, he admitted it himself. That makes no sense.*

The dark mark contorted and became discoloured until it was a pale cloud drifting through the dark staff room.

Harry drew his wand. *Let's see what it is, then.*

Lupin stepped between him and the cloud. There was a flash of blue light, then the boggart was gone. "It seems that I've misjudged the time," the professor said, his smile strained. "You all did excellent. There will be no homework today."

Harry felt the stares on his back when they left the room. *Let them stare.* Lupin must have thought his boggart would be Voldemort given his past. Not facing it would make the exam more difficult, but he hardly minded. Seeing the livid look on Greengrass's face when the lesson ended was worth it.

*How does it feel when things don't go your way, Greengrass?* Curiosity gnawed at him despite the victory. *I wonder what it would have been.*

***September 9, 1993***

***The Headmaster's Office***

***8:30 PM***

Ron looked around the circular room, hardly believing he was here. *I doubt even Fred and George have been here*. Percy --- perfect, Head Boy Percy --- probably had been, but it was something to rub in the twins' faces later.

A soft squawk drew Ron's attention. He actually jumped when he saw the phoenix lift its head.

Dumbledore chuckled from behind his desk. "Fawkes inspires the most delightful reactions."

Ron blushed furiously. "I thought he was a statue," he mumbled. The bird had been soundless and sleeping not a heartbeat before.

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "That is certainly a first. Thank you for bringing me something unique. I'm so rarely surprised in my old age --- and when I am, the surprise is usually of the unpleasant variety."

Ron grasped for words. "Uh... you're welcome, sir."

"I think we have talked enough about birds and surprises. Come, take a seat." Ron obliged him, suddenly wary. *What does he want? I haven't done anything.*

"You aren't in trouble," Dumbledore said as if reading his mind. "Quite the opposite."

*Huh?* "The opposite?"

"Quite. I have heard some worrying third-hand accounts involving you and wanted to ask after you."

Ron screwed up his face and thought. The answer came fast. "Lupin told you?" he asked. "He said he wouldn't, he swore no one else..." Ron trailed off when Dumbledore raised a hand for silence.

"It is Professor Lupin. Always address people by their correct names, Master Weasley."

Ron's blush returned. "Sorry."

"It is a lesson many young people must learn; you are not the first and you will not be the last. You can take solace in knowing that Professor Lupin did not tell me about the events of your first practical lesson in Defence Against the Dark Arts."

Ron wracked his brain, trying to think of who may have told Dumbledore. The possibilities were disturbingly numerous. Most of Gryffindor House had been talking about it, sans a few girls who mocked Hermione for her boggart --- herself, puffy-eyed and dressed in tattered robes. That had confused Ron. She said it had nothing to do with being poor but wouldn't explain. *Girls.*

Not that he could judge anyone --- his boggart had reminded him of that in the most painful way possible.

***Earlier that week...***

Ron wondered, not for the first time, what it meant to be brave. Gryffindors were supposed to be bold and courageous, but his knees were shaking and he felt anything but brave.

Thinking about what was coming just made it worse. That horrible cold, those rattling breaths, that slimy grey hand that had protruded from the monster's sleeve...

The boggart began changing and Ron readied himself. *How the hell do I make a dementor funny? I'm not ready! I...*

Someone screamed. Hermione stared up at him through lifeless eyes. Ron stared back, his jaw agape. The front of her robes were drenched in blood, its crimson fingers reaching out across the floor. The wound was in her chest --- a gaping, sword-shaped wound that had already killed her. *Just like it killed Luna... just like I killed Luna...*

Ron gasped for air. It felt like he was flailing beneath icy water while he tried gathering his thoughts. *It's not real! It's not real! It's not real!*

How could one find humour in death? How could anyone think of something to laugh at whilst staring their greatest failure in its lifeless face? Ron's lips moved, but no words came out. His arm began dropping, the room spun past him, torches whirling past his eyes.

"Riddikulus."

Ron stumbled back from the flash of blue light only to find that Lupin had stepped between him and the boggart and was now forcing it back into the cabinet.

The fear was gone, but there was no relief. Ron thought he would rather face the boggart ten more times than feel how he felt now. Nothing was worse than knowing he had failed again.

***Back in the present...***

"I see that you're confused," said Dumbledore, bringing Ron's attention back to the present. "There is no need for you to puzzle out the truth, I intend to tell it to you."

Ron blinked. "You do?"

Dumbledore smiled. "I can hardly expect you to be honest if I myself sit across from you on a throne made from secrets."

Fawkes let out a trill that clawed at Ron's heart. It was cold and unlike the music felt down in the Chamber of Secrets. Guilt twisted at his stomach, but there was nothing to be guilty for. "What was that?"

Dumbledore looked ten years older. "A reminder."

*Barmy, he is. Brilliant, but barmy. "*I, uh, don't mean to be rude, but why am I here?"

"Ah yes, we have strayed from the topic at hand. My apologies. I have never been good at staying topical." Dumbledore slid his half-moon spectacles down his nose and peered at Ron. "I was told about your boggart by Professor McGonagall, who was in turn told by Miss Granger."

Ron jolted. "Hermione?"

"She worries for you. Most children your age fear mundane things they may one day grow out of. What that boggart became is something darker, the root of scars that may never heal. Miss Granger was right to worry."

"So what?" Ron asked, his hands moving restlessly in his lap. "Are you gonna ask me what it means or something?"

"Heavens no. I can guess what it means, but my interpretation matters little and it is not my place to ask such questions. I will listen and offer advice if you ask for it, but I will not press you. I want only to know how you're handling the events of the past two years." His expression soured. "I ought to have had this talk with you long ago. You have my sincerest apologies for overlooking the traumatic end of your first year. That was callous of me."

Ron had been unprepared for this. *What am I supposed to say?* Dumbledore was a mythical figure like Circe or Merlin. "Thanks, sir, but I don't think there's anything you can do. It's just... hard."

"May I ask a potentially invasive question that you are under no obligation to answer?" Ron nodded; what else was he going to do? "What is it that troubles you most?"

Ron's answer was immediate and painful. "That I could have saved them."

Dumbledore closed his eyes; he looked even older now. "You could not have saved them."

"Maybe not Neville," Ron admitted, remembering the true tale of his old friend's death --- a tale that Dumbledore thought he knew not. "I could have saved Luna, though."

Dumbledore opened his eyes; they were wet and filled with sadness. "I was not in the Chamber of Secrets, so I will not argue. I will say only this. Those who experience loss often wonder what they could have done. Your mind might conjure a hundred ideas, but they are nothing more than dreams. Anyone who is good and kind must know they did all they could. It is hard, but necessary. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live."

*This is why Dumbledore's so great.* He was wiser than any man Ron had ever known. *I'd be dumb not to ask while I'm here.* "What would you do if you were me?"

"I would not dwell on those dreams, but I would hold onto them and remember what the lost meant to me. Think of them during times of need and continue forward. Light can be found even in the darkest of places. Remember that, Ronald, it is of the utmost importance."

***Meanwhile, in the dungeons...***

Tonight was Harry's first Occlumency lesson with Snape and he couldn't quite decide how he felt. Harry was ready to endure the worst Snape had to offer, but still he was excited. The prospect of reduced strain was becoming more welcome with each passing day --- a night had yet to pass without Harry completely crashing.

Someone moved behind him and Harry turned, wand raised and ready for Greengrass, one of her plans, or even Sirius Black.

"I should probably have warned you I was coming up behind you."

Harry glared at Theodore. "Do that next time."

"I'll keep it in mind." The pair fell into step together. "Where are you off to?"

A sigh escaped his lips. "Snape's office."

"Lucky you."

Harry grimaced. "I'm supposed to learn something interesting, but we'll see."

The two plunged deeper into the dungeons, nearing the dark room Snape called his office. Harry waited. Theodore was pondering something and would speak when he was ready; Harry knew that about him by now.

"Why did Lupin stop you from facing the boggart?"

Harry took a few more steps before he answered. "He never told me."

"But you know, don't you?"

Harry mussed his hair. "I think he expected it to be the Dark Lord."

Silence hung between them. "Would it have been?"

Harry cast a handful of detection charms under his breath, but they were alone. "You think I would have accepted a truce if I was that afraid?"

Theodore shrugged. "It would be a good way to stay safe."

"It would be a good way to get betrayed." Harry forced himself not to shudder. "I guess that might still happen, but here's hoping." *I just need to buy time. One day, I'll be strong.*

Theodore shook his head. "The Dark Lord would be mad to betray you. He understands what kind of ally you could be."

*Do you understand that, Theodore?* Harry wondered. *Is that why you've been so involved lately*? Things had begun adding up. First the book of Nott family magic, then continuously choosing him in small ways over Draco, then his attentiveness to the smallest of Harry's needs.

Harry rid himself of those thoughts. *Don't be so paranoid, you're friends.* "What about yours?" he asked.

"My what?"

"Your boggart. It was the Dark Mark, but I don't understand why."

Theodore's next step was awkward and he nearly stumbled. "The Dark Lord... wasn't pleased with those who used the Imperius Defence," he said. "He saw it as a sign of disloyalty. I still worry that he might snap at Father."

*Liar.* Harry knew not why he was so sure, but he was. *There's something more he isn't telling me.* There was no point in prying; Theodore would reveal no more than he had already. *Add it to the list*, he thought, remembering the other fears he would be investigating.

***The Ancient Runes Classroom***

***5:30 PM***

Hermione strained to watch him through the crowd, marked by a head of unruly black hair. A first year squeaked when she shoved him roughly aside, but she paid him no heed. "Potter!"

His steps stuttered and he glanced over his shoulder, fingers flexing. "Granger?"

"Can I have a word?"

Surprise passed across his face, but not for long. "Sure. Follow me."

They wove through the bustling crowd on its way down to dinner and around the next bend, through a tapestry Hermione had never noticed and into a secret passageway hidden behind it. The crowd's bustling was still audible, but muffled by the walls and tapestry.

"This good enough?" She nodded. "All right, then. What was it you wanted?"

Hermione reached beneath the collar of her robes and withdrew the golden hourglass. "You have one of these." It was not a question.

She waited for him to fidget, but instead he smiled. "Caught on, have you?"

She narrowed her eyes. *Is he mocking me? I can't tell.* "I noticed the first week, but wanted to be sure." She crossed her arms, frustration mounting when his smile turned anger. Her cheeks flushed with sudden knowing."You knew I had one!"

His smile faltered. Now he ran a hand through his hair, finally discomforted. *Good.* "Snape told me the day I got mine."

*That's horribly unfair!* Professor McGonagall had made no mention of another time turner inside Hogwarts. She scowled; it was just another example of Snape's blatant favouritism.

Her scowl deepened. "How do you look so calm? This is insane!"

His expression smoothed. "Yeah," he admitted, shifting from foot to foot. "That's about what I thought when Snape gave me the time turner."

"That's it? You just thought it was insane and moved on?"

His look made her eye twitch, the look of someone inspecting a slow child. "Granger, what else was I supposed to do? I wasn't going to complain and give it back."

"It doesn't bother you that they'll just give these out to children?" She placed her hands on her hips, glaring slightly up at him. "What about the dementors, or the blood supremacy, or everything else wrong?"

His face twitched but he hid his thoughts well. *Too well,* she thought, resisting a shiver. *That's not natural.*

"It bothers me," he admitted. "Less the time turners and more some of the other things, but we're students. We can't do anything yet."

Her heart quickened, visions of change swimming behind her eyes. "Do you think things can be changed? Do you think people like us can make this world make any sense?"

Potter appeared to chew his words, his face void of all emotion. "There are always ways to change things, but they're usually messy."

**Book 3: The Looming of Shadows**

**Chapter 11: Looming Clouds**

***September 2, 1899***

***Cairo, Egypt***

***8:33 PM***

Gellert appeared surrounded by sprawling sands and blood-red skies. The air was thick and humid, but the burning heat was retreating with the slowly setting sun. Long shadows lounged in the sand as the sun neared the horizon, making the few buildings Gellert could see far off in the distance look like shadowed peaks rising up to hide the glowing star.

Gellert glared up at the sky. Anything resembling blood would set him off. Blood was what he should have shed two weeks ago. *It will be worse now.*

He had fled England following his duel with Albus and slunk around the German countryside whilst deciding where next to go. That part of his plan remained unchanged. *I must be prepared, both for Albus and for conquest. I cannot fail, the greater good dies with me.*

It would be better once that final battle came. *It will be kinder. Albus will no longer wonder and the world will be rebuilt. All I must do is win.*

Gellert recalled the duel for what must have been the thousandth time. His findings were the same. *Albus was more skillful.* Gellert had been more seasoned and a better traditional duellist, but Albus's control over elaborate magic was something Gellert had never seen. *And there is Drochuisc. How did he come to know it?*

It mattered not. They would fight again and experience would no longer be on his side. Age would even out that field. *I must win in other ways, learn magics beyond imagination and come armed with the ultimate weapon*.

That journey started here, amidst what remained of a once-great empire. *No stone will remain unturned. I must win. Everything depends on that victory.*

"Did you really believe you'd win?" Harry asked once the familiar cell came into focus.

Grindelwald's expression remained smooth and unreadable. "Why do you ask this? You experienced my thoughts as clearly as I once did. You know the answer."

"It just seems weird. You admitted to yourself that Dumbledore was more skilled and even that your only real advantage wouldn't matter by the time you fought again."

"One does not chase the things I sought without confidence. My doubts about beating Albus came mostly in those early days. I grew surer of the outcome as the years aged. You will understand this in time."

"But you were never positive. They say you never dared attack Britain so long as Dumbledore lived."

"I never feared Albus. I was wary of him, just as he was of me. You forget that he never pursued me in all the years I reigned. Not until inaction would have shamed him."

Harry frowned. "So both of you felt the same?"

"We knew better than any what we were capable of. I knew Albus had affinities I would never have and he knew the same. I knew that he had once been more skillful, whilst he had heard rumours that I possessed the very weapon we once sought as children."

"The Elder Wand?" Harry asked, suddenly breathless. "You actually found it?"

"It was my life's work," Grindelwald said as though it was the simplest thing in the world.

"Where is it?" Harry asked, eyes wide.

This was what he needed! If the tale was true, then this would be an unbeatable wand! Harry could take revenge against Black, establish himself in the wizarding world, and even match the likes of Voldemort.

"I am unsure what became of it."

Harry's stomach dropped. "Unsure?"

"It is difficult tracing an artifact most believe to be mythology whilst trapped in a cell."

"But Dumbledore would know, wouldn't he?"

Grindelwald's expression was unreadable. "Albus would never have claimed the wand."

"But you two---"

"Those discussions were the fantasies of children. Albus was always more interested in the stone. The wand would have repulsed him by the time we fought. I am sure he discarded it."

Harry's hands twitched. *That would be stupid.* "But wouldn't that be dangerous? That wand is supposed to be unbeatable."

"Yet Albus defeated me."

Harry frowned; his mind had skipped that detail. "How?"

"The wand does not make one invincible. Its long and bloody history speaks volumes of just how vulnerable one wielding it becomes."

"But you still wanted it."

"I was naïve. If I could do it all again, I would leave the wand untouched. I beg you not to make my old mistakes."

Harry nodded, but said nothing. *I never swore I would*. Whether Grindelwald had lost or not, the wand still sounded like just the thing he needed.

"I have something else to ask of you before I field more questions."

*Something to ask of me? He hardly ever asks things of me.* Harry's palms grew sweaty. "What is it?"

"Do not ask Albus about the wand. It would pain him. Let the matter lie."

Harry reluctantly nodded. *It's not like he would answer anyway*. "Can I ask other questions now?"

Grindelwald smiled thinly. "Of course."

"A friend of mine at school is named Theodore Nott. He said one of his ancestors worked with you."

"A Cantankerus Nott worked under me for a time."

Harry recognized the name. *Theodore's great grandfather; the one who wrote the Sacred Twenty-Eight*. "Theodore mentioned a spell a few days ago that you used to get rid of important people. He called it the Suicide Curse."

"Many did. The name was apt. I will show you my discovery of the spell soon. You may ask questions once I have."

Annoyance rose, but he forced it down and remained still. Arguing would not get him what he wanted. *Grindelwald's set in his ways, he won't change his plans for anything*.

"There was something else I wanted to ask you." Harry reached beneath the collar of his robes and brought out the time turner.

Grindelwald stared, leaning slowly forward. "So they have done it, then."

Harry could not help but be surprised. "You know what it is?" *Snape made it sound like a new invention.*

"I am educated enough to guess. Inquiries into the traversing of time are not a modern concept. None had succeeded by the time I was imprisoned. I presume that has changed."

"Yeah, this is called a time turner. It lets me travel a couple hours back in time."

Grindelwald's eyes had not left the time turner. "How did you acquire this?"

Harry nearly sneered --- the whole thing was still ridiculous. "The Ministry of Magic gave two to Hogwarts students to test them for education. We're not supposed to use them for anything other than extra classes and homework, but I don't think they have a way of monitoring us, really."

"And I presume that you will walk the logical path and take the fullest advantages afforded to you by your government's incompetence?"

"Once I figure out how." Harry ran a hand through his hair. "It's draining. It's like you're in two places at once any time you travel back in time. Your mind's working twice as hard and it catches up to you quickly."

Grindelwald drummed his fingers against his knee. "And you wish to ask if I have ideas on how this drain might be circumvented?"

"I've already been given a couple of ideas, but I need to learn Occlumency subskills that I know almost nothing about."

Grindelwald smiled. "Ah, yes. We shall begin immediately."

***September 24, 1993***

***The Great Hall***

***8:46 AM***

Harry noticed the tension hanging thickly in the air when he entered the Great Hall that morning. Whispers wafted from all four tables and hundreds of heads bent low. His own friends were tense when he approached. *Pansy isn't even looking at me. She usually can't stop staring*.

"Something's happened, hasn't it?"

"Black's been sighted here in the Highlands," Theodore admitted. The others shifted in their chairs --- Pansy even glared at Theodore like she wished he had never opened his mouth.

*They expect me to explode*. He reached for the paper, his expression blank.

***SIRIUS BLACK PLANNING AN ATTACK ON HOGWARTS?***

***By Rita Skeeter***

*Sirius Black is perhaps the most notorious prisoner Azkaban prison has ever housed. His dozen murders more than a decade ago were well-documented, as was his status as the lieutenant of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.*

*We all know who Sirius Black is and what he has done, but many of us allowed ourselves to forget about him until this summer, when his dark legacy was furthered by an impossible escape from Azkaban. In doing so, Black became the first prisoner ever to escape and started a nationwide manhunt that has thus far yielded no results.*

*Many witches and wizards all throughout the country have claimed sightings these past two months, but now, it seems that the Ministry of Magic have their first official lead.*

*Some in the community have suspected for some time that Sirius Black may target Hogwarts. It's only natural given his loyalty to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and the fact that his vanquisher dwells within the castle's walls. Some have gone as far as to say that Black's top priority is taking vengeance against Harry Potter for the events of October 31st, 1981, but others have been more skeptical.*

*Those skeptics are slowly losing ground after reports emerged claiming that Black has been sighted in a remote Scottish district and that a team of aurors was deployed to the area.*

*"We've thought for some time now that Black may be in Scotland," said the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge. "We've been prepared for this for some time. There's nothing to worry about."*

*When asked about the validity of this newest lead, Amelia Bones --- Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement --- admitted that this lead is one they are "taking special care to investigate thoroughly."*

The article continued with Skeeter speculating exactly how and when Black planned to strike. *Nothing but useless gossip*.

A fire burned inside him. His stomach ached from its heat. Its smoke coated his throat, choking him. *Calm down, this isn't the place*. He slowly brought his mind to heel. *Black will get his when I'm ready, I swear it.*

"Nothing surprising, really," Harry said, impressed by how calm he sounded. *I doubt my friends buy it, but I've probably disappointed a bunch of eavesdroppers.*

Theodore took back the paper. "The ministry was expecting this. They wouldn't have stuck a bunch of dementors here if they weren't."

"Here's hoping." Harry imagined a swarm of hooded figures descending on Black, imagined the laughter fading from his eyes, replaced by concern, then horror. *I can dream*.

Pansy cleared her throat. "If you boys are done dragging the mood down, I have gossip."

Draco's lip curled while both Crabbe and Goyle sighed. Theodore just rolled his eyes. Harry played along but secretly appreciated Pansy. *She's always been good at reading me and moving things along when they get tense*. He liked that about her; he had never considered how important it was until now.

"What is it this time?" Harry asked, exaggerating a sigh. "Has another couple gotten into the prefect's bathroom?"

"Nothing like that," she said with an evil-looking smile. She dropped her voice to a whisper. "It's about Daphne's sister."

Harry's interest leapt. He had meant to keep tabs on Astoria but had lacked the time. He had thought about the idea more. *She's afraid that I'll approach Astoria*. Between the boggart and the way she'd stared at him during her sister's sorting, it was the only logical answer. *She should have been less obvious*.

"Anything interesting?"

"She's having trouble in classes, but not in the normal way."

Theodore scowled. "Not in the normal way? What is this, a riddle? What are you on about?"

Pansy smirked. "Last week, the first years were learning the Lumos Charm and something went wrong."

"Wrong?" Draco asked. "What could possibly go wrong with a Lumos Charm?"

"She got the spell working, but it was apparently like lightning. The flash was so bright that a few firsties were sent to the hospital wing for headache cures and the person sitting across from her had to have their eyes looked over."

That was odd. *I guess her having trouble isn't that weird*. Daphne's brilliance had never extended to actually casting spells. *Nothing like that ever happened, though. I don't even know how that's possible*. Harry looked down the table and thought he saw her, but it was hard to tell; she was small and surrounded by larger students.

"That's not all," said Pansy. "Flitwick worked with her all of their next lesson and they couldn't get anything different to happen. It just flashed super bright every time."

*That makes even less sense*. A one-off outburst was one thing, but this was something different. *I'll have to ask Grindelwald about it*. He considered what Grindelwald might have done in his place. *He wouldn't sit back and wait for answers --- he would go after them*.

"Pansy," he whispered when Theodore and Draco began conversing about Quidditch, "since I probably won't see her until tonight, can you get a note to Cassie for me?"

***That night, in the Slytherin dorms...***

Harry sagged into his four poster bed. Fridays were always long and tiring. There was Double Potions, midnight Astronomy, and lessons with Dumbledore --- not to mention the use of his time turner.

Harry sighed and laid his head back against his pillows, only for something bright to catch his eye. There was a bluish glow coming from his trunk. *The journal*.

Harry climbed from bed and pulled a sleek, black journal from his bag.

He shivered. *It still reminds me of Riddle's diary*. Voldemort had sworn the only enchantments on it were ones to let them communicate discreetly. *I have to take his word for it; if he wanted to hurt me, he could have done it three times this summer.*

Harry flipped open the first page with trembling hands.

*It's been almost a month.*

He frowned, but scribbled his reply. *I'm not the best at communicating.*

*And you think I am?* Harry could practically feel the amusement in those words, but he ignored it and wrote his reply.

*You're the one who wanted communication.*

*Bold,* came the reply. *It has been a long time since I've spoken with someone so blunt.* Harry's heart froze. *Did I go too far?* he wondered. The words continued. *It isn't something I've ever encouraged in those who serve me, but it suits you and the relationship I hope we'll have.*

Harry breathed a sigh of relief. *I've never been good at holding my tongue. It got me in a fair bit of trouble before Hogwarts.*

This next reply came faster.

*We both know you would have been punished for existing in the presence of those creatures. You wouldn't have denied that even when we first spoke.*

*No, I wouldn't have. I've gotten a bit better at holding my tongue since Hogwarts, though.*

*The education system is quite proficient at quelling children's spirits. I have wondered at times whether that's the reason Binns remains employed.*

*Where the hell did that come from?* he thought, then wrote his reply. *What do you mean?*

*You will not find another magical institution with a ghost in a position of authority. I could overlook this if Binns was competent, but everyone who's passed through Hogwarts in the last century knows otherwise.*

Harry's frown deepened. *What does that have to do with muggles?*

*Everything. Classes in History of Magic are some of the only times the world cannot pretend that muggles have not wronged us. It is the one time during which their evils are exposed. The problem is that those expositions happen in Binns's class, where most students are more concerned with sleeping than they are with paying attention.*

Harry winced. He had stopped attending Binns's class last year and showed up only for compulsory tests and the like.

*It seems a bit much to believe,* he wrote back after considering. It was an interesting idea, but an insane one. *I know you hate Dumbledore, but I can't imagine him doing that.*

*Can't you?* Harry could practically see Voldemort's sneer. *Can you think of no time when Dumbledore has held secrets from you? Can you think of no time when Dumbledore has ever bent or altered the truth? Can you think of nothing that Dumbledore has ever hidden?*

Angry fires burned, fanned by the Dark Lord's words. *Neville's own family doesn't know how he died,* he thought. *I'll bet Luna's doesn't either, plus there's the prophecy. I only know what he says it means*.

Then there were the memories; the friendship with Grindelwald and the death of his sister. *Maybe more. Who knows what I might learn from Grindelwald*.

*No,* he wrote back, *but that doesn't mean I believe you. Dumbledore keeps Peeves around even though he's a menace. Maybe it's not that easy getting rid of ghosts.*

*It isn't, but it is within Dumbledore's capabilities. For all of his shortcomings, he is still the second greatest sorcerer alive.*

*Will I ever be that confident*? There was no doubt when Voldemort or Grindelwald spoke. It was like they knew the outcome of everything they talked about. *I wish I was powerful enough to be that confident*.

*I doubt this conversation will go anywhere,* Voldemort wrote, *so let's try something else. Have you further investigated the events of last June?*

Confusion fell over him and he frowned. *What do you mean?*

This reply came slowly. *I expected better from you.*

That stung. *Why? Why do I care what Voldemort thinks*? Harry scowled and scribbled his next reply. *What do you mean?*

*Two students have their minds altered by a powerful artifact and you're not curious about the after-effects?*

Harry's eyes narrowed. *I never really had much to do with the Carrows, so I honestly didn't think about them.* How had he not considered them?

*An oversight. I would have at least expected you to show some interest in a place so dear to your house's founder.*

Harry read the words again but still missed their meaning. *What is he talking about*? Then it dawned on him and he sat bolt upright, all weariness gone. *The Chamber of Secrets --- I haven't even explored the Chamber of Secrets*!

**Author's Endnote:**

**There really haven't been many good cliffhangers yet this year. This one will have to do for now. Shame :(**

**I will also just say right here that, if you're hoping Harry will find some vast library or instant power boosts down in the Chamber of Secrets, you will be sorely disappointed.**
