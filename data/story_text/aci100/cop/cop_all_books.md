**Chapter 1: Ruptured Realities**

***June 10, 1994***

***The Astronomy Tower***

***1:23 AM***

Hogwarts castle, set atop a towering cliff, stood tall and imposing. At this time on most nights, the hulking black shape would have blended in with its surroundings, with the insurmountable mass of black stone camouflaging conveniently with the equally dark abyss of the night around it. Tonight was different. Tonight was the night of the full moon. The silvery, luminescent light didn't allow the castle to blend in at all. It cast the titanic building into sharp relief, beaming down upon it like an ethereal spotlight, making the castle look more like an ominous, impenetrable fortress than a boarding school for the finest witches and wizards of the United Kingdom.

Despite the beguiling image painted by the night, the castle really was just a boarding school --- if one wished to truly quantify the existence of such a magical place. Of course, it was a boarding school that was more well-secured than any other building in the country, if not the world. A boarding school with magic practically vibrating in every nook and crevice of its ancient, stone walls.

Yet still a boarding school. A boarding school that hosted a vast number of students between the ages of eleven and eighteen. At the present hour, it was expected that every last one of said students would be curled under their covers, willingly succumbing to the grasp of Morpheus and preparing for yet another day.

That was mostly true, at the current moment in time.

One student served as a notable exception. A small, thin figure with jet-black hair, large, clunky glasses and deep, emerald eyes. If one was to look upon the figure from afar, standing atop the astronomy tower and looking over the grounds in what might have appeared to be disinterest, they might have thought they were gazing upon a young, regal prince surveying his land.

The truth of the matter was far less jovial and far more tragic.

The figure who stood atop the tower wasn't quite as young as those onlookers might inevitably believe. He was small for his age; years of neglect did that to a person. One might think him a tall boy of eleven or twelve years old.

They would be wrong.

This boy was nearly fourteen. He would be in seven weeks' time, and he would be entering his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Less than twenty-four hours ago, the still third-year boy in question had completed his final set of end-of-year exams.

That was the normal part of his day.

School was actually the most normal part of this boy's existence. Excluding the countless number of near-death experiences he'd been through while residing within the school, naturally.

Yes, Harry Potter had been through a fair number of those.

Life hadn't exactly given him any breaks.

If one ever wanted to complain about their own life, they might find small reprieve when comparing their own life to this boy's. At the very least, it would surely put into perspective, for most people, that their own lives truly weren't that bad.

When barely more than a year old, Harry Potter had lost his parents. They had been murdered in cold blood by the most feared dark sorcerer to walk the British Isles since Emeric the Evil. Despite the tragedy, it had appeared, for the briefest moment in time, as if life had perhaps sought to balance the scales. It had taken Harry's parents away from him, but in return, it armed him with a defence so potent that it vanquished the Dark Lord. A feat that some of the best witches and wizards in the United Kingdom had failed to accomplish for more than a decade.

Any who thought it a fair exchange would be wrong.

They would be viewed as naive for thinking that life always struck a perfect balance. The truth of the matter was that life was, and always would be, as ruthless as it is magical.

Lord Voldemort, though vanquished for a time, hadn't truly died that night. Worse still, he'd taken far more from young Harry Potter than just his parents. He had taken the two last decent members of his family and indirectly sentenced him to ten years of hell under his aunt and uncle's rule. Ten years of hell where his bedroom would be a boot cupboard and his daily consumption habits would mirror that of a boy half his age, with half of his nutritional needs.

Yet the cruelty of circumstance and destiny had not stopped there.

Voldemort was hell-bent on returning any way possible, and he was willing to stop at nothing to see that reality come to light. Harry almost died while ensuring that exact prospect hadn't manifested in his first year, when he had, yet again, vanquished Lord Voldemort with the help of his mother's final gift. A defensive manifestation of her sacrifice so powerful that not even the deadliest of magics could touch him if cast by her killer.

He supposed that in his second year, Voldemort hadn't been directly responsible for the atrocities that befell the school. Much of the blame for that fell upon the well-dressed shoulders of Lucius Malfoy. Though he supposed Voldemort had initially created whatever the hell the diary had been, so the psychopath was far from blameless.

And then there was this year... Merlin, where to even start with this year.

Sirius Black had escaped from Azkaban, where he had been imprisoned more than a decade ago for a crime he had never committed. Peter Pettigrew had framed him. The rat Animagus had done so masterfully. If not for the spell that Sirius and Lupin --- the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor --- had used to revert Pettigrew to his human form, Harry might have been fooled.

Not that it had mattered he wasn't.

Pettigrew had escaped regardless, and that wasn't even the worst thing that happened in the past number of hours.

Not by a long shot.

As the memories crashed into his psyche like an oncoming tide, piling the debris of despair upon his mind, Harry slumped down the side of the Astronomy Tower. He was completely unprepared to deal with the savage surge of emotion that poured into every fibre of his being, threatening to tear him apart from the inside out.

This explained what most people might have mistakenly assumed was a look of disinterest while Harry Potter had been surveying the Hogwarts grounds.

The truth of the matter was that the look had been one of complete and utter numbness. He hadn't a clue what to think or feel, and his facial expression had reflected his state of mind.

It was far too much. All of it was far too much.

***Sometime earlier...***

Over the course of the last few hours, Harry's brain had taken in about as much information as a human's mind could possibly cope with.

Sirius Black --- his godfather and the man whom he had suspected to be responsible for selling his mother and father to Voldemort was innocent. Peter Pettigrew --- a man unanimously believed to be dead before tonight --- was the true culprit. And to make matters worse, he'd been hiding right under Harry's nose for nearly three years and the Gryffindor youth hadn't even noticed. Neither had his best friend, Ron Weasley for that matter, but that seemed slightly more forgivable to Harry, even though he knew that sentiment made no sense and was utterly ridiculous.

Whilst on their way back up to the castle, the procession of students, fugitives, professors and traitors had been ravaged when one of the professors in question had made a rather horrible miscalculation. Harry would have gawked at Lupin's idiocy if he himself had not been blatantly guilty of failing to employ common sense many times in the past three years. Walking into the light of the full moon around students, knowing that you're a werewolf, had to be up there with lighting a match while bathing in gasoline in the ludicrously idiotic department.

The werewolf was mercifully driven off by Sirius Black, who was also apparently an illegal animagus alongside Pettigrew, because of-fucking-course he was. Speaking of Pettigrew, he'd escaped, and it had infuriated Harry beyond comprehension or belief.

What had been worse was watching the scenes that unfolded next.

While chasing Pettigrew, Sirius had been ambushed by dozens of dementors --- the tall, hooded figures who lorded over the hellhole that was Azkaban prison. Harry had converged on the scene as quickly as possible, but it hadn't been enough.

No matter how many times he tried to conjure his patronus, he couldn't quite do it. It would form and even surge forward, but the brilliant manifestation of hope and happiness would quickly be drowned by the metaphorical ocean of despair that ploughed forward to meet it.

Eventually, Harry heard Hermione scream and fall, and he joined her, prone and vulnerable on the ground not moments later. A dementor had leaned over him, drawing its horrid, rasping breaths and reaching up to pull down its hood, revealing its disgustingly disfigured face. Idly, in what he had assumed at the time to be his final moments of true life, Harry thought that he must be one of a very select few to actually see under a dementor's hood.

Before he could suffer a fate deemed by most to be worse than death, a brilliant silver light filled his vision. It was quite obviously the light of a patronus, but it was far brighter than any patronus Harry had ever seen. Far larger, too. Unnaturally light, blindingly bright, and spine-tinglingly powerful, the stag patronus galloped majestically through the air and at long last, it had enough power to drive off the oncoming swarm of dementors.

Ruthlessly battling against the pull of unconsciousness, Harry looked up, with difficulty, and peered across the black lake. There, on its far shore stood a figure. One who, at the time, he had suspected was, somehow, his father.

Yet even that hadn't been the most jarring revelation.

The most jarring revelation had come when he had looked to his left. It felt as if all of the oxygen in his lungs had been frozen solid, not only rendering it useless but transforming it into a legitimate hindrance. He tried to breathe, but he couldn't. He tried to think, but it wouldn't work. He tried to move, but he was unable.

Every fibre of his being had unilaterally paused in horror to gaze upon the nightmare made reality that quite literally laid in front of him.

It was Hermione, lying face up.

She wasn't dead, but that did nothing to crush the grief that began tearing at Harry's very soul. For a time, he wondered if that would do what the dementor couldn't and simply wrench his soul straight from his body. Hermione's eyes weren't lifeless, per se, but they lacked any spark of intellect or personality. It was as if somebody had flipped a dimmer switch. No emotion nor thought sparkled within the orbs. They were flat, dull, and stagnant, much like the useless container they now occupied.

He looked away as tears stung at his eyes, intent on seeing anything but the horror before him.

Yet it still got worse.

On his other side, lying in much the same position as his closest female friend was an emaciated figure with long, matted hair, sallow skin, and blurred grey eyes.

Harry couldn't help it.

He let out a moan of pure agony as he allowed the blackness to close in on all sides, pulling him under and into a realm that would hopefully contain much less pain than the one he'd just left.

***Back in the present...***

Harry's heart nearly wrenched itself from his chest at the mere memory, yet even that hadn't been all.

He had woken up in the hospital wing some time later and been almost immediately confronted by the somber visage of Professor Dumbledore. Harry had hurriedly explained exactly what had transpired to the venerable Hogwarts Headmaster, but he had done so in a detached, monotone voice.

And that was when yet another mind-blowing facet of the magical world had been revealed to him, as if it wasn't a complicated enough place already.

Time travel supposedly existed, because of-fucking-course it did. Dumbledore had pulled a long, golden chain with an hourglass-looking pendant and explained to Harry exactly how his brilliant, muggleborn friend had managed to take as many classes as she had.

It explained everything.

From her utter avoidance of the topic, to the inconsistencies in her cover stories, to her impossible timetable.

Dumbledore had then made a proposition that was even wilder than the reality of his best friend being a time traveller.

He, Harry, could use the time turner --- which Dumbledore had taken from Hermione's soulless body --- to go back and change the events of the past.

For a time, the flames of hope had been stoked once more, and a roaring fire of pure resoluteness had been lit inside of Harry's stomach, filling his chest, contracting his throat, and solidifying his resolve.

How naive he had been to believe.

To believe that he, an average, thirteen-year-old wizard could go back and change the events of the past, saving his best friend and godfather in the process, while simultaneously capturing the man who was truly responsible for his parents' murder.

He supposed "average" may have been a bit harsh. He was no Merlin, but he was at least talented at Defence Against the Dark Arts. He had managed the fastest time in his year on the obstacle course Professor Lupin had set up earlier that day and it was far from rivalled. He also very much doubted anyone else in his year would be casting a Patronus Charm any time soon, let alone one strong enough to combat dozens of feral, soul-sucking demons.

For it had indeed been he who had cast the patronus that had spared his own past self's life. And yes, wasn't that just a lovely paradox of mind-bending complexities, possibilities, and problems. Any glimmering hope of his father --- which had only strengthened when he'd been enlightened as to the existence of time travel --- had been ruthlessly crushed the moment he'd been forced to spare his past self. He had no idea what would happen if he allowed his past self to die, but he also had no desire to find out.

He hadn't been quite quick enough in accepting the fact his father hadn't arrived.

He had wasted valuable time trying to capture Peter Pettigrew. His efforts had once more been fruitless, and it had, in the end, been a major factor in his second consecutive failure. He had managed to save himself but for the second time that night, he was left gazing down on the soulless husks of Hermione and Sirius. This time, no mysterious time traveller had appeared to help him, which only meant one thing in Harry's mind.

No matter what he did, there was no way he could prevent the outcome from taking place.

That thought had brought forth Trelawney's words from earlier in the day, and he'd realized far too late that Pettigrew couldn't be stopped. Fate had ordained it, after all.

*"THE DARK LORD LIES ALONE AND FRIENDLESS, ABANDONED BY HIS FOLLOWERS. HIS SERVANT HAS BEEN CHAINED THESE TWELVE YEARS. TONIGHT, BEFORE MIDNIGHT. . . THE SERVANT WILL BREAK FREE AND SET OUT TO REJOIN HIS MASTER. THE DARK LORD WILL RISE AGAIN WITH HIS SERVANT'S AID, GREATER AND MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER HE WAS. TONIGHT. . . BEFORE MIDNIGHT. . . THE SERVANT. . . WILL SET OUT. . . TO REJOIN. . . HIS MASTER. . . ."*

Going after Pettigrew had truly been his downfall, yet Harry couldn't will himself to try for a third time.

He couldn't bear the sight of Hermione's dull eyes and the vacant look on his godfather's gaunt, but otherwise regal countenance. If he had to see any of that again, it would break him. The nightmares would be bad enough. He didn't need to see it again in the waking world. Besides, he had a dreadful feeling any intervention he made would lead to the same, morbid outcome regardless.

If he was meant to time travel yet again, surely he would have seen that intervention come to fruition the last two times he had attempted to capture the traitor and save those whom he cared for.

They had doubtlessly found the bodies on the grounds by now. He hadn't stayed around. He had bolted to the top of the astronomy tower as soon as possible, not caring that he wasn't in possession of his invisibility cloak. That was with his past self when he'd succumbed to unconsciousness and present Harry, with his mind boggled and any chance of coherent thought voided, hadn't possessed the wherewithal to grab the cloak.

It hadn't mattered.

He'd made it to the top of the tower easily enough, where he now sat shaking, still wearing the golden time turner; it's metallic texture cool against his skin in the otherwise humid night. There was a moment while surveying the grounds when Harry had debated just throwing himself off the tower. He had gotten to that point. He had endured so much in his almost fourteen years of life, and he thought now, at long last, he had finally been pushed past his breaking point.

He couldn't sit still anymore.

Yet he couldn't stand, either.

His legs wouldn't work, no matter how hard he tried.

Even when he heard the thrum of voices below, doubtlessly investigating his absence and obviously coming up on the stairs that would lead them up onto the tower itself.

Harry's shaking intensified. If he were found, he would have to explain what had happened. That would mean vividly reliving the atrocities of the past number of hours, something he was not only completely uninterested in, but rather adverse to as a whole.

Yet he couldn't stand.

Whenever he tried, his legs failed him, but he couldn't face Dumbledore. Not when he would have to relive all that had happened, and not with the knowledge that he had failed.

It was all too much, and his hands, which so desperately needed to be doing something, twitched idly towards the golden band around his neck.

If his theories about the inevitability of the night's events were true, this would do little more than postpone the meeting that would be as inevitable as the events themselves. But it was good enough, for now. Anything was better than facing this, and he couldn't just sit here and relive all of it.

He reached up towards his neck with shaking hands, extracted the time turner from the collar of his shirt and turned it --- turned it many, many more times than he could count.

And swiftly relived the events anyway.

It was odd.

He was watching everything play out as if they were on fast forward, yet it was happening in reverse, and he seemed to be watching from a third person's perspective. He had to be, for he couldn't possibly be here again, watching the horrors of the night when he, Harry, was supposed to be sitting atop the astronomy tower.

He watched once more as Sirius and Hermione had their souls sucked out. He watched once more as Pettigrew escaped again, and then he relived the confrontation that had come before it.

But it didn't stop there.

In fact, the replay of sorts he was experiencing only seemed to accelerate as he crashed back through time.

He was in his Divination exam... no, his Defence exam. He was in classes, then flying against Draco Malfoy in the Quidditch final, and then back in classes for a significant period of time.

Before he knew it, he was back in the kitchen on Privet Drive, watching Marge inflate like some grotesque balloon.

Yet still, it didn't stop.

He was in the Chamber of Secrets, standing in front of a boy several years older and much taller than himself. A boy with hair as black as Harry's and dark, blue eyes. Then, he was in Tom Riddle's diary, watching him frame Hagrid as the Heir of Slytherin before he was back in the Slytherin common room, polyjuiced as Crabbe as he and Ron tried to pry Draco Malfoy's non-existent secrets from him.

On and on it went.

He watched, once more, the rogue bludger, Dobby at Privet Drive, the confrontation in the catacombs of Hogwarts with Quirrell, the detention in the forest and on, and on, and on.

Faster than he could believe, he was watching memories from before Hogwarts and still the speed at which he seemed to charge backwards through time increased. Soon enough, he was watching things he didn't even remember, things he hadn't been able to remember for several years.

It wasn't long before he was back in Godric's Hollow, watching Voldemort remorselessly tear down his family. He barely had time to register the pangs of fury and sadness before he recognized the day he was born.

And then... darkness --- complete and total blackness, as he could neither see nor feel anything at all.

Harry didn't know how long it was until he opened his eyes once more. It felt like only a second --- little more than going to sleep --- but he knew it might have been far longer. More disconcerting, however, was that when he finally did muster up the strength and energy to open his eyes, he didn't recognize his surroundings.

They were vaguely reminiscent of King's Cross Station, but this was most obviously not the train station housing the magical platform associated with Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was so thrown off by his surroundings that it took him a moment to realize he was naked.

Until he thought that, at least.

Once he did, soft, warm clothes moulded seamlessly to his body. They fit better and more comfortably than any clothes he'd ever had.

As he glanced at the vast, bright, unfamiliar space around him, he could do little more than voice his singular, predominant thought aloud.

"Am I dead?"

"Complicated thing, that."

Harry jumped about a foot in the air and whirled around. He went to go for his wand, only to realize he didn't feel it in his pocket. At the thought, it materialized in his right hand, every bit as perfect as he remembered.

Speaking of memories, what he saw in front of him made his jaw fall agape.

He had seen these two people before, but only in dreams and dementor induced nightmares. And his most recent journey through what must have been time, he supposed.

The man and woman were both of average height. The woman had a slim waist but a curvaceous figure, and the man looked lean and athletic. Ostensibly, Harry's father --- for this could be nobody but his father --- had stayed in shape; even after his Quidditch days. Like his son, he had jet-black hair, and their facial features were nearly as identical as everybody made them out to be. The primary differences were their eyes and the fact that, unlike Harry, James's glasses didn't look like something out of a poorly illustrated cartoon.

The woman who stood beside James had Harry's eyes, just as everyone had told him for nearly three years. They looked a bit more alike than many gave them credit for. Harry noticed that while his appearance did primarily resemble that of his father, there were certainly hints of his mother's softer features as well.

For much of his childhood, he had envisioned meeting his parents. That dream hadn't gone away when he had finally been taken away to Hogwarts. The image had just become clearer. In both cases, he always pictured that, if he met his parents, they would smile proudly out at him.

That wasn't the case in reality.

They didn't look displeased. Just... serious.

Lily's lips were thin and her eyes practically shot sparks. James, who had spoken, wore a hard expression and his face was set in a firm line of resolute determination.

"Mum, Dad?" Harry's voice was a whisper in the wind and barely discernible. Quite honestly, he was just impressed it hadn't failed him altogether.

Lily smiled. It wasn't a smile of joy. it was a sad, sombre smile, and the woman was very obviously trying not to have an emotional breakdown of her own. "Yes, Harry. It's us."

He had no idea how to react to that. Perhaps he was supposed to rush forward into the arms of his parents after all this time.

Two things stopped him from doing that.

He had never been overly fond of being touched at all. He had put up with it on the odd occasions when Hermione had forced it upon him --- likewise in the case of Mrs. Weasley --- but that had been about it. After years of associating touch with danger, it wasn't an easy thing to become accustomed to.

The second was that, for an oddly ominous reason Harry couldn't articulate, there was an... instinct, of sorts. A feeling that if he walked into the arms of his parents, he was sealing himself into something.

Neither James nor Lily seemed to hold his reluctance against him. On the contrary, they beamed at him. In a sad, depressing sort of way, but there was definitely pride in their eyes. Why that emotion would exist after he had failed so utterly, Harry wasn't sure.

"Am I dead?" he asked again, his voice only slightly louder than before.

James and Lily Potter exchanged glances before the former shrugged and spoke. "It's like I said before. Complicated thing, that." When James saw that answer clearly wasn't going to cut it, he finally elaborated. "Honestly, Harry, you're not really dead or alive right now."

"What do you mean I'm not dead or alive?"

Now it was Lily's turn to speak, and she did so with so much compassion and understanding that it made Harry's heart ache. For a vague moment, he examined how his life could have been different had one or both of the two survived. He did not allow his mind to linger on that dream for too long. It was a depressing rabbit hole he'd gone down many times; one he had no desire to return to.

"Time travel isn't something to be trifled with, Harry. Nobody has ever tried to travel back more than a few hours and come back."

His heart sank. "Nobody?" Both parents shook their heads. "They died then?"

"Some of them," James answered vaguely. "I don't think there's a set thing that happens, if truth's to be told. I think time is always just going to be finicky. Like your mother said, it's not to be trifled with. Funny things happen when you mess with time." He winced. "Or... not so funny, most of the time."

Lily shot him a somewhat annoyed, clearly exasperated glance. "What your father is trying to say is that the time turner had an... effect." She paused. "Do you have any idea how many times you turned that, Harry?"

He blushed. "I... no. I have no idea."

"Neither did the time turner," said James with obvious amusement. "You turned the bloody thing so many times that it lost track and just booted you back as far as it could go."

Harry's eyes bulged. "As far as it---"

"Don't worry," Lily assured him. "You're not going to end up in the Middle Ages, or something. When you travelled to before you were supposed to be born, well..."

"The universe doesn't like getting kicked in the dick very much," his father supplied.

"James!"

"Am I wrong?"

Lily hesitated. "Well... no, but that isn't the point!" She sighed. "You went back too far, Harry," she filled in. "You went back to a time in which you weren't supposed to exist. The universe is a lot of things and it revolves around a lot of principles, and order is one of them. It doesn't like when things happen that can change reality. Usually when that happens, it... rearranges events in a way that eliminates the threat to that reality."

Harry's stomach gave a jolt. "So I'm really dead then?"

"That's where it gets complicated," James said with a grimace.

"And even more so because we can't tell you everything," Lily added.

"Why not?"

This didn't exactly make sense to Harry. If he was dead, what did it matter? If he wasn't, surely they could explain something like this to him, since it didn't seem as if it would be overly relevant.

"It's just... the dead can't impact the world of the living. That's a rule of nature."

"So I'm not dead?"

"No, not exactly," James answered at last, running a twitchy hand through his windswept-looking hair.

"But you said the universe---"

"Oh yes," said James, the corners of his lips tugging upwards, "the universe did try to eliminate you."

"Try?"

He sighed. "And here's the part where we have to be cryptic and hope, if you go back, that you can figure things out." He seemed to choose his next words very carefully. "Dumbledore's told you about the connection between yourself and Voldemort, hasn't he?"

"My scar, right?"

"Your scar, yes."

Harry nodded. "He said it happened the night he attacked. The night..." his voice trailed off as he looked towards his mother, whose sad smile remained, emotion dancing in those familiar green eyes like beads of sunlight on the surface of a shimmering lake.

"When I sacrificed myself for you."

Harry looked down towards his feet. "I never wanted you to die," he muttered. "Not for me --- not for anyone."

Lily took a step forward and pressed a finger under a surprised Harry's chin, tilting his head up to look at her. "I would do it again if given the choice." The look in her eyes practically dared him to challenge her, but he did not dare.

"Even after I let you down?" He hadn't meant to speak the words. They'd just sort of... tumbled out of him.

"Let us down?" James asked, sounding completely mortified. "Merlin's balls, Harry, where in the ruddy hell did you ever get that idea?"

Harry looked up with visible reluctance. "I failed," he said lamely. "Pettigrew got away. Sirius got kissed by dementors --- so did Hermione. A fate worse than death, all because I wasn't fast enough."

"You're human," Lily said softly, tears shimmering at the corners of her eyes. "We all make mistakes, Harry. No thirteen-year-old boy should *ever* have to deal with anything like what you had to deal with. It is incredible that you did so well for so long."

"We thought for sure we'd see you the night you went after that snake," James muttered darkly, obviously referencing the basilisk that Harry had fought in order to permanently close the Chamber of Secrets. "Don't ever say you failed, Harry," he continued. "If it wasn't for you, Snakeface would've come back at the end of your first year. Let's not even talk about what would have happened in your second."

Lily's smile turned from sad to fond. "You have no idea how amazing you are," she told him warmly. "I know Albus told you this at the end of your first year, but stop to think about it for a moment. Do you have any idea how few people could have looked into that mirror and seen something so selfless?"

"Funnily enough," James said heavily, "that's also the reason you're here."

"The mirror?"

"No, your selflessness. You really are an amazing person, but sometimes, the best people don't always get the best results."

Harry looked back at the two of them, puzzled and wide-eyed. "What about Professor Dumbledore?"

Lily sighed deeply. "Albus is a great person, but that's part of the reason why he never did manage to beat Voldemort before the prophecy happened."

"Prophecy?"

"Lily," James said through gritted teeth, "we can't---"

"Oh, come on, James. It will hardly matter now. If he goes back, it isn't as if the prophecy is going to apply any more. It can't, given what will happen."

"True, true." James turned to Harry. "Long story short, there was a prophecy that said you would have the power to destroy Voldemort and that one of you would have to kill the other in the end. Snakeface only heard the first bit, which is why he attacked us. To try and eliminate the threat nice and early." He scowled. "Being too good a person doesn't usually get you places, but karma really is a bitch when you go *that* far."

It was a mark of how strongly Lily agreed with that statement that she didn't chide his verbiage.

Harry frowned. "So... what are you saying?"

"Be more selfish," James answered. "Don't be a prick, but you need to put yourself first sometimes. If you don't, not only will you never enjoy your own life, but it probably won't last long, in your case." He obviously said that last part very grudgingly, but all present knew the words to be true. "Don't just cave," he continued. "Look into things. Decide what it is *you* want to do. Fight for what *you* believe in."

"Yes, do that," seconded his mother. "Educate yourself. Learn what it is you want to do, but also how to do it. I love Hermione, but you won't always have somebody like her to help you." Harry's gut clenched. Boy, did he appreciate that statement right about now. "You're the perfect boy. The perfect boy for others. All that we're asking is that you be the perfect boy for yourself."

Resounding silence rang through... wherever the hell they were. After a time, Harry sought to get back to one of his original questions. "So, I'm here..."

"Right," James remembered. "The connection you had with Voldemort---"

"Had? It's gone now?"

James genuinely smiled. "Yup --- all gone now. That's why you're here." He hesitated. "I\...really can't say much except for the fact the connection was a hell of a lot deeper than your minds. A... piece of Voldemort connected to you. That piece is what reality destroyed when it tried to get rid of you. It sort of acted as a shield." James smirked. "Nasty shock for the bastard, I'm sure. I doubt it was meant to."

"Remember what your father just said," Lily ordered, sounding stern for the first time. "If you go back, it will be extremely important. You're going to need to research... pieces of people. Pieces that can form deep connections." She seemed to collect herself before adding, "Very dark magic. The worst of magic, but you can find the information. I know you can."

"You said... if I went back? You're telling me I have a choice?"

"You do," said James, becoming all of a sudden a whole lot more business-like. "See, the thing is, you should be dead, but you're not. Reality is still rather cross with you. It will let you live but only under certain... conditions."

Harry's brow furrowed. "Conditions?"

"The world you go back to won't be the one you left. I couldn't tell you more than that even if I knew, and I have no idea. I just know how the universe works. It won't let you exist in the world you just left, because existing there should be impossible, for you."

"But it will let you live," Lily jumped in, obviously not hiding which option she would rather Harry chose. "It will let you live the rest of your life in a world where your existence doesn't contradict something that's already happened."

Harry's eyes narrowed. "It's going to send me back to some parallel universe? Where everything is different?"

"I doubt it," James said thoughtfully. "That would be a whole hell of a lot of work. More than likely, it will send you somewhere with minor changes."

"The thing about reality," Lily began, taking on what was obviously her lecturing tone, "is that it's infinite. There are an infinitely large number of realities out there. The reality you left won't let you back, but a reality that is very similar will have no problems taking you, so long as your existence in that world doesn't go against things that have already happened."

"And you can't tell me where I'll land?"

"We have no idea where you'll land."

Harry looked at the two of them and made the admission that had been eating him alive ever since the notion of a choice was mentioned for the first time.

"I don't want to die, but I don't want to fail again either."

"Then don't." It was his father who answered, and his voice sounded so certain, Harry almost believed it.

"It isn't that easy."

"No, it's not," the man admitted. "Neither was learning the Patronus Charm at thirteen. Neither was surviving ten years of hell with those bastards who abused you. Neither was fighting Riddle at the end of your first year. Hell, killing that damned snake was anything but easy. But guess what? You did it all, didn't you? This is no different."

"You won't fail so long as you work harder than ever." His mother genuinely sounded as if she had no doubt.

Their words might have been meaningless placations. Harry couldn't tell. The only thing he knew was that after not hearing those voices for twelve years, their unwavering faith filled him to the brim with a warm, fuzzy feeling. It was almost like a phoenix's song.

"You want me to go back, don't you?" It was the final thing he needed to know.

"We want you to be happy," his mother said softly, reaching out and cupping Harry's cheek gently. Oddly, he didn't feel any compulsion to pull away. Perhaps because it was her, or maybe it was just the fact that none of this was truly happening; at least, not in the physical sense.

"You have a lot more to get out of life if you choose," said James with a knowing smirk. "I think you'll find all kinds of things and people to make you happy." Lily shot him a mildly disapproving glare, likely for the more subtle implications that went way over Harry's adolescent head, but she didn't disagree.

Harry closed his eyes. "I'll go back," he said softly, his jaw setting in a resolute line. "But..." Merlin, this was an embarrassing and out of character question. "Can I have one hug? Just to know what it feels like, you know?"

Both of his parents beamed, stepping forward and engulfing him in warmth before, moments later, darkness overtook him again. Harry instinctively knew that the next time he opened his eyes, he would be in an unknown reality. One his world had never even been aware of.

**Chapter 2: Star Gazing**

***July 31, 1942***

***The Leaky Cauldron***

***2:30 PM***

Harry's world snapped into focus with all the suddenness of a well-disguised land mine. He expected something much like the way his life had faded into... whatever he'd just experienced. The place between life and death, he supposed.

That very thought made him shiver as goosebumps rose all over his body. It wasn't so much that he was afraid of dying. For a brief moment, while he had been suspended somewhere between the two planes of being, he had seriously considered not coming back, if only because he had absolutely no idea what he was coming back to. His father had been reasonably sure he wouldn't be thrown into a world too different from his own, but he hadn't exactly sounded confident, either.

But the thought of death... it made Harry shiver, just a little bit. After so many brushes with the reaper, one might expect Harry to fear its ever-present shadow less than the typical mortal. This was somewhat true. It wasn't as though he had been hesitant to throw himself treacherously close to the all-consuming abyss on multiple occasions. As his father had pointed out, the basilisk had very nearly thrown him over the edge.

Well, perhaps not.

Perhaps whatever connection he'd shared with Voldemort would have merely meant his death would have been rendered moot and he would have been thrust back into the world that he knew.

It couldn't have been that easy.

What scared him most, about death, wasn't so much the concept as it was the sense of unfulfillment he would have if he were to die now. To say he was so young would admittedly be cliche, but Harry thought it rather apt. Especially seeing as about ten years of his life had hardly counted. It wasn't as if he'd been able to explore much of what the world had to offer. Even while at Hogwarts, as much as he loved the castle, he had done little more than try not to die. It wasn't as if he had truly experienced much of life itself. He had been too busy cleaning up the mistakes of the adults a vast majority of the time.

He could understand the Chamber of Secrets.

He was a Parselmouth, which made him uniquely qualified for solving that particular problem. But the stone? Surely it shouldn't have been he who solved that. Not to mention the mess involving Sirius...

Just the thought of his godfather made his heart ache. He had known the man for no more than an hour, but he had quickly ingratiated himself to Harry. More than that, it was just one more reminder about the horrid number of atrocities he'd been forced to endure during his life.

Hopefully, whatever subtle changes were made to the universe would result in his life being mildly less chaotic.

It was a naive thought.

He knew that even then, as he finally took the time to look around the shabbily furnished, dimly-lit room he now sat in. He knew the thought was naive but young, innocent Harry Potter could never have known exactly how naive and off the mark the thought truly was.

Unlike when he'd "died" earlier and the pale world he'd shared with his parents for a brief time slowly faded into existence, this had been different.

The blackness had begun closing in on all sides while he shared the first and last hug with his parents that he would ever remember.

Yet it hadn't been a slow transition.

Just as the darkness had all but blocked out his vision, Harry had blinked, and it had been as quick as that.

That also meant the entire experience was exceedingly disconcerting, which in turn meant it took him a large amount of time to gather his bearings.

He appeared to be alone in the corner of a booth --- not unlike those found in muggle restaurants. The booth in question seemed to be situated in a particularly dark, out-of-the-way corner of the room he now sat in if his vantage point was anything to go off of.

Looking around the room itself, Harry realized with a jolt not quite as sudden as being thrust back into reality, that he recognized this place.

The low lighting, the weathered furnishing, the bar which dominated a large portion of the pub. Hell, he even recognized the barman, though he looked a lot younger than Harry remembered him, which was odd. It was hard to tell from a distance, but he actually appeared to have all of his teeth.

Harry wondered why, of all things, reality had decided to shift that minor detail. He vaguely remembered with some panic a muggle concept that always seemed to arise when speaking of dimensional travel.

The butterfly effect.

He wondered if that was actually a thing in this world. At least he took small comfort in knowing that perhaps the only perk of being sent to an entirely different reality was that he couldn't screw up his original one.

But he wondered if the butterfly effect applied. If it did, he wondered what had happened differently for Tom the barman to have all of his teeth intact. He also wondered, if that was the case, what kind of ripple effects a sudden dimensional traveller might have on the fragile balance of reality just as it was seemingly trying to sew itself back together.

He couldn't worry about that.

Not now, at least.

It wasn't as if he would be able to do anything about any changes that might have transpired. He would eventually have to observe them in order to know how to react, but beyond that, there was nothing to gain from worrying about what may or may not be different.

It was a far better use of his time to take stock of his current situation. If the disastrous end to his third year had taught him anything, it was that he needed to be a whole lot more aware of what was going on around him. Accepting the common gospel would no longer be good enough. Not after he'd felt the consequences of doing just that.

Padding down his pockets, he breathed an audible sigh of relief when he felt his wand resting within one of them. It appeared as if he was wearing standard black robes. There was no Gryffindor crest, nor any marking at all. The robes also seemed... different. He couldn't quite put his finger on why. They just felt... heavier? Rougher? Less comfortable? All of those things, but conjoined into one. It was no major difference, just significant enough to be noticeable while being subtle enough to not be obvious.

Why the world had sought to change his robes was yet another mystery to Harry, but it was quite minor in the grand scheme of things. Realistically, it wasn't as if this minor change would have major impacts, so he thought it likely best to let it go.

He cursed as he stood, realizing he had no way of obscuring his face from the view of the number of witches and wizards currently present. That was unfortunate. He remembered the swarm of admirers he'd been forced to endure during his first trip to this very establishment with Hagrid before his first year. He wondered whether or not he was going to have to go through something similar now. He certainly hoped not. That had been bad enough the first time, and he'd had a giant of a man acting as crowd control. Without Hagrid, Harry didn't even want to know how persistently the crowd would pester him, nor what extent said pestering would inevitably escalate to.

With an internal sigh, Harry supposed the best way to deal with the unpleasant reality of the situation was simply to cross the small pub as fast as possible. Hopefully, nobody would notice him. The odds were slim, not near favourable, but it was the best he could do at present.

To his great shock and bewilderment, he seemed to go completely unnoticed. He had never visited this establishment without being noticed, even if every occasion hadn't been quite as memorable as the first. Just as he stepped out of the dimly-lit pub, squinting his eyes against the vividly bright stream of sunlight that sought to blind him, he chanced one, brief glance over his shoulder. Of all the gathered patrons of the Leaky Cauldron, the only one he remembered was Tom. He shrugged; it wasn't exactly as if that was saying a whole lot.

He tapped his wand on the correct brick. After doing so for most of the last summer, he doubted he would ever forget which one was correct.

His jaw nearly detached when he stepped into Diagon Alley, but not for the same reasons as his first-ever visit.

The first time Harry had visited the alley, its magic and illustriousness had blown him away. He'd never seen such a place, even ignoring the obvious aspect of magic that was perpetually in play around the alley. When adding that into account, it only exacerbated his fascination with Diagon Alley.

This time was different.

After last summer, he had very much doubted the sight of the alley would ever be jaw-dropping to him again. After all, he'd spent about half of his summer roaming Magical Britain's largest metropolitan area. By the time he'd gone back to Hogwarts on September the first, he had practically memorized the alley and could picture it vividly and on command if he were to close his eyes and focus upon it.

Yet in contradiction to what he'd thought, this was what made the sight in front of him so striking. Indirectly, perhaps, but it was that picture-perfect image he could conjure up which made the sight in front of him so... wrong.

There was no other way to say it.

The sight in front of him wasn't what he had expected.

Well, that wasn't entirely true.

Most of what he saw was familiar, though some of it only vaguely so. Other things --- like the towering, marble outline of Gringotts that dominated the skyline of the alley, even from a distance --- hadn't changed at all. But other things...

Many of the shops were not what he recognized. The alley's main attractions still seemed present, from what he could tell. Gringotts, as earlier observed, stood tall and proud way down the street. Madam Malkin's was there too, though the displays were different.

In his world, there had been vibrant shades and colours prominently on display in the front window alongside the more standardized variety of robes. Now, there appeared to be nothing vibrant in sight. Even the most flamboyant robes on display were... muted. Positively dull compared to anything Professor Dumbledore might have found appealing. Many of the robes were black and grey, but even the ones that weren't were dark, dull blues and reds. They looked almost faded, as if being viewed through a filter compared to what he was accustomed to.

The styling was different as well, even though Harry --- who knew absolutely nothing about fashion --- really wasn't in a position to comment.

Something began to stir in the deep recesses of his mind. Something small, sinister, and terrifying. A prospect that was felt more by his subconscious, if for no other reason than the fact his conscious mind didn't want to even consider that impossibility.

Yet the irregularities stretched on.

The ice cream shop Harry had frequented for much of the summer before his third year was noticeably absent. The building was there, but it appeared to be some kind of antique shop.

Harry's heart began to quicken as his consciousness finally admitted defeat and allowed the sinisterly implausible possibility its subconscious had conjured up earlier to finally leak through, invading Harry's imagination and spreading rapidly. It did so with the effectiveness and accompanying dread one might expect from a particularly deadly disease.

That couldn't be possible, could it?

That was the plot of a million horrible muggle films. Usually, the overdramatized ones that perpetuated every bit of internal conflict for the sake of needless angst.

So, naturally, Harry did what any self-respecting protagonist in one of these films might have done.

He rapidly scanned the street and honed in on his target.

The headquarters of the *Daily Prophet.*

He marched towards the building with quick, panicked steps. The reality bowled him over before he reached the door. It did so as soon as his eyes rested upon the date plastered on the displayed paper for all to see.

*July 31st, 1942*

Harry didn't freeze, or cry, or drop to his knees, or do any such action that the aforementioned protagonists from those horrid muggle films might have done. He hastened towards another, familiar landmark, one he could also use as a benchmark to judge whether or not the *Daily Prophet* was simply pulling a particularly cruel joke.

When he reached the windows of *Quality Quidditch Supplies* and glanced to the broomsticks proudly on display, he finally accepted exactly what had happened.

Well, accepted may have been a strong word.

He accepted the fact that it had happened, but he was far from accepting of the fact that it was truly his reality now. That would still take some time. What else could you expect from a thirteen-year-old --- no, wait --- now a fourteen-year-old boy who had just been suddenly thrown half a century back in time? At the moment, he was completely numb to the reality, the horrible reality that was settling in his brain, which still seemed to want nothing more than to reject the possibility outright.

He hadn't just been thrown into a different reality.

He had also been thrown back in time.

Like... *way* back in time.

In a twisted, warped sort of way, he supposed it made sense. He wasn't sure how many times he had spun the time turner, but it had been a lot. The only reason he'd died in his world was that he had travelled to before his birth, so he supposed he should have expected to wake up in a time before he was born.

But this far back?

Fuck!

It hadn't even occurred to him that since reality was now willing to let him exist, it would place him in whatever year the time turner might have taken him to.

1942\.

He scoured his memory for things he knew about that year in particular.

There wasn't much.

On the muggle side, it had been the height of World War Two. Soon after America had joined the ranks of the allied forces, if he remembered correctly. He thought it also about a year after the Nazis began their attempted invasion of the Soviet Union. An invasion that would prove to be fruitless and, in the eyes of many, be remembered as the turning point of the war.

On the magical side...

He discernably winced.

He knew even less.

Binns had never covered anything from the twentieth century during History of Magic, and Harry hadn't exactly been studious, even in the subjects he'd liked. He was beginning to realize exactly how foolish his lax behaviour in regards to his studies had been. Without Hermione to guide him, he felt weak, exposed, and helpless.

It wasn't a fun feeling.

As he continued digging through his mind for anything he knew about the magical world in 1942, he made a silent vow to himself, though he supposed he had already promised as much to his parents.

No more slacking off.

He was going to be the best wizard he could possibly be. He'd managed to cast the Patronus Charm, for Merlin's sake! It was the only feat of magic he had ever dedicated a considerable period of time to, and he had achieved it. Surely that meant something, right? Surely it spoke to the potential he could have if he was more willing to chase it?

He wasn't sure, but he was sure as hell going to find out.

But back on track...

Harry had to admit defeat. He knew absolutely nothing about the magical world as of 1942. Nothing except for the fact that Grindelwald was still at large, since he hadn't been defeated by Professor Dumbledore until 1945.

He wasn't sure whether to jump for joy or bury his head in his hands at that revelation.

On one hand, he was pretty sure Voldemort wasn't at large in 1942. Which meant that the psychopathic dark lord wouldn't be after Harry's head, at least not for quite some time. Hell, he might never come after Harry. Not with the changes made to the universe. Even if he did, at least Harry would have a head start. At least he would have time to prepare. It was far more than what he could say for his own world, in which he'd been thrust headlong into Voldemort's path at the ripe old age of one. Exactly how much time he would have to prepare, he had no idea. He wasn't actually sure how old Voldemort was...

Wait, that wasn't right.

He at least had an idea.

The Chamber of Secrets had been opened in October of 1992. It hadn't been closed until May of the following year, and if Draco Malfoy was to be believed --- and Merlin, he, along with Voldemort, were probably the only things Harry wouldn't miss --- his father had told him the Chamber of Secrets had last been opened fifty years earlier. That had been in December of 1992. In the Chamber of Secrets, Tom Riddle had also bragged about how he had been preserved in memory form, in the diary fifty years ago.

He'd been... sixteen? Seventeen?

He hadn't said. Harry just knew him to be a Prefect at the time the Chamber of Secrets had been opened. His age was hard to place. He was exceptionally tall by any standards, but that wasn't exactly a strong fact to judge by.

But it wasn't necessary to know exactly how old Riddle had been.

He had been in the twilight of his Hogwarts years in the early-to-mid 1940s. Harry couldn't be sure he and Lucius Malfoy had meant fifty years exactly, or whether they'd just been rounding. After all, fifty years ago sounded much better than forty-eight years ago for an arrogantly monologuing villain. Forty-eight just didn't have the same ring to it.

Yet even that wasn't much help.

Harry wasn't exactly sure when Voldemort had become a true threat. A decade before his parents died? Was that what Hagrid had implied? He couldn't honestly remember, nor had he ever looked further into Voldemort's war. This thought made his face burn with heat as his insides writhed with shame. He really had been lazy and foolish.

But no more.

However long he had to prepare for Voldemort, he would take.

That was if Tom Riddle even became Voldemort.

He supposed it was possible he wouldn't. His father had suggested that most likely, not too much would change compared to the world he had resided in, but that had pretty much been thrown out the window when he'd woken up thirty-eight years before being born.

Merlin... that was a sentence and a half.

But even without Voldemort, there was Grindelwald to contend with.

He knew almost nothing about the man. Just that, until Voldemort had risen, he'd been viewed as quite possibly the most dangerous dark wizard of all time. Oh, and of course the fact that Professor Dumbledore had defeated him about three years from now.

He really needed to learn more about Grindelwald.

Apparently, the world was all too willing to give him first-hand experience.

Harry's senses tingled as his hair stood on end.

Something had changed. Something he could not yet quantify.

It wasn't long before the screaming started, and Harry's eyes widened.

Now, it was blatantly obvious what had changed, and he quickly scampered out of the way, ducking through a side alley and trying to keep his jaw attached.

A mob had appeared from nowhere.

As in, literally appeared.

Harry had to blink several times to make sure he'd actually seen that. He knew wizards had floo travel --- a nearly instantaneous method of traversing long distances --- but what he had just witnessed was something else altogether. Something he hadn't known to be possible.

Magical Merlin, he needed to start reading.

Every last member of this mob was dressed in grey from head to toe. All of them wore large hoods, obviously pulled up to obscure their faces from view. On their backs, Harry could see from his vantage point that they all wore the same symbol.

A symbol that he had never seen before.

It was an odd, triangular symbol, but it was difficult to make out more than that from this distance. It somehow sent a shiver down his spine for reasons he could not articulate.

The mob seemed to take up refuge in the centre of the alley, firing curses indiscriminately and in every direction. One of the smaller, shabbier shops had been lit ablaze, and others still had their windows shattered. That wasn't even to mention the alley's now mostly screaming occupants, the slower of whom to get away falling to spellfire, one by one.

Needless to say, it was complete and total pandemonium.

Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw three groups of three figures break off from the crowd. Each group seemed to head off in a different direction, and Harry observed that nobody else appeared to have noticed them. Harry saw one group in particular heading off in a familiar direction.

They were moving towards Ollivander's.

His heart quickened as the world around him seemed to slow down, his speed of perception rising in unison with his suddenly heightened levels of adrenaline.

He knew this was stupid. He was a thirteen-year-old boy that was fairly talented in Defence Against the Dark Arts. These were three adult wizards who had obviously completed their education and were just as unmistakably dangerous.

But something inside him couldn't do it.

He couldn't stand by and let them escape.

He couldn't stand by and let them torch the old man's shop; the place where most witches and wizards in Britain received their first wand.

It was wrong, and Harry's sense of morality was just too strong.

With a deep breath and a sigh that indicated he knew exactly how foolish this was, Harry skulked after them.

***Meanwhile, in Slug and Jiggers Apothecary...***

Horace Slughorn was rather cross.

The owner of this particular apothecary was driving an unreasonable bargain. He knew how much powdered griffin claw cost. It was about half of what this man was trying to sell it to him for, and he was being downright unreasonable about the whole thing.

He'd been in the shop for about an hour negotiating when all hell broke loose.

The first indicator that something was wrong was the screams coming from somewhere outside. For about a minute, Horace resolutely tried to ignore them. He was determined to get the griffin claw, and he wasn't going to let some accident out in the streets distract him from that goal.

After a full minute of constant screaming had elapsed, he knew something was out of the ordinary. Once he started hearing explosions, he paused in mid-sentence.

That wasn't good.

He had no idea what it was, but it definitely wasn't good.

As if to confirm his suspicions, he felt an odd, prickling sensation on the back of his neck, and he knew about a second before it made itself obvious that danger had arrived.

He drew his wand just in time.

The front wall exploded, revealing three wizards in grey, hooded cloaks, all of them throwing around rather heinous magic.

Several patrons of the shop fell. Some to simple curses, some to much more. A shelf near Slughorn and Mr. Jigger exploded, sending shards of glass and rather destructive concoctions raining down upon them.

Mr. Jiggers had been caught completely unaware. He dove to the floor in a completely futile effort to not get buried under potions and glass, but Slughorn was faster. Without a word, he summoned a spherical shield of magic, protecting them on all sides.

The glass ricocheted harmlessly off of the shield, and the liquids stored within the vials rolled off of the barrier like water off a windshield. Several spells careened towards them, but none of the initial volleys were potent enough to break Horace's shield.

"AVADA KEDAVRA!"

That certainly would have done it, but Horace hadn't been foolish enough to rely solely on a shield. His wand had already been in motion before the Killing Curse had been fired, and the glass which had rained down all around him had already begun to rise into the air. By the time the sickening green light drew near, its path was obstructed by a wall of glass. The offending barrier shattered on impact and burst into green flames, but it saved the Hogwarts Potions Master and, more importantly, gave him time to get his wits about him and fight back with something of his own.

A large flock of ravens bore down on his assailants. They weren't overly problematic, but they did buy Horace enough time to put his true plan into motion. The next gesture he made with his wand sent dozens of vials soaring towards the attackers just as they managed to thwart his birds. Just before the projectiles could make contact with their rather taken-aback-looking targets, Horace vanished their containers with a flick of his wand. The three men's screaming could be heard throughout the shop as the volatile concoctions mixed and bubbled sinisterly on their skin.

From there, it was all academic.

The men hadn't expected any resistance. It wasn't that they weren't skilled --- they had just been caught completely off guard. They had expected the shock of their arrival to overwhelm any opposition. They certainly hadn't expected the rather talented Head of Slytherin House --- which, by nature, meant Horace was also prepared for any situation.

And by this point in time, now that most of the shock had worn off, the few wizards still standing in the dimly-lit apothecary had their own wands drawn, and suddenly, the attacking forces found themselves vastly outnumbered.

Horace wiped sweat from his brow as he idly twirled his moustache. There was still screaming from outside. He was going to need to leave at some point, if for no other reason than to make it to the nearest apparition point and get the hell out of the alley. It was best to do so now, before more maniacs decided to show up and make his life even more miserable.

Honestly, he hadn't even gotten the damned griffin claw.

***Moments later, outside Ollivander's...***

Harry realized he was going to die just seconds after he made his opening move.

He had followed the three men --- whom he later realized were masked as well as hooded --- as discreetly as possible. It quickly turned out that his earlier assumption was correct. Their target was indeed Ollivander's. They spoke in a language he vaguely thought might have been German, so he couldn't exactly make heads or tails of it, but he got a general idea of what they were saying.

They planned to burn it to the ground.

He couldn't let that happen.

Right about now, he desperately wished he had his cloak. It had been with his past self when he'd driven off the dementors and, in his haste to get away from all of it, he had been foolish enough to not retrieve it.

Less than thirty minutes after arriving in this new, alternate universe, he was going to pay the price for his shortsightedness. Most probably, the payment was going to be his life.

So much for doing better this time around.

When the three men had their backs turned, Harry had leapt from a side alley and rained as many spells down upon them in as short a time as he could manage. One of them was struck by a Full-Body-Bind as they turned to face him, but the other two weren't. One of them shielded, whilst the other just sidestepped.

That was when Harry came to a startling realization.

However talented he might have been in Defence Against the Dark Arts, he was only talented in the specific scope of the class. He'd never put in a whole lot of extra-curricular research. If he lived through this experience, that was something he planned on changing. Unfortunately, he really didn't like his odds of living through this experience.

He didn't seem to know any spell powerful enough to breach the shields the men conjured, and Harry instantly knew he would die.

One of them shielded both he and his partner as the other went on offence. Harry couldn't break the shield and he didn't know enough defensive magic to stay alive long. The only shield charm he knew of was the Aegis Vocar shield. That was a low-level shield charm that moved with the caster, but it was meant primarily as a defence against fairly minor jinxes and hexes. Certainly not curses, least of all those of a similar nature to the ones being carelessly thrown around by the masked man who attacked him.

A jet of pale green light neared him, and Harry instinctively knew he couldn't be hit with that spell. He dove to the side, rolling on impact and avoiding two more spells while in motion. As soon as he was on his feet, he returned fire with another three successive Full-Body-Binds. They impacted against the man's shield one after another, quick as gunfire, but the shield didn't break, even though Harry could see the man wince as if holding it had become physically taxing.

Harry's body was aching. When he'd rolled to avoid that last curse, he'd done a number on himself. The sleeve of his robe had been severed by a grazing curse a while ago, and the exposed skin had been sliced quite efficiently by the pavement as he'd rolled. He was also tired. Without knowing adequate defensive magic, he'd been forced to rely solely on movement. Dodging, feinting, diving and the like, which was naturally fatiguing, especially since he wasn't in the best of shape.

All the purebloods might have thought Quidditch got you into shape, but the lot of them were morons. You were on a broom the entire time, for Merlin's sake. Seeker drills had helped his reflexes and reaction time, but there was a difference between having fast reactions and being in shape.

Having spent most of his primitive years locked in a cupboard and neglected of true nutrition, he wasn't exactly the shining bill of health. He could run, that much was true, and his endurance wasn't terrible; likely thanks to his oaf of a cousin. But "Harry Hunting" was a distant memory now, and it wasn't exactly as if he'd kept up running since first arriving at Hogwarts. He was also a bit underdeveloped for his age, which didn't help matters pertaining to his physical fitness.

All of this was to say Harry was defeated and he knew it. His chest heaved with heavy breaths as his legs trembled and his elbow continued to sting in the humid, afternoon air and bleed on the hot concrete all around him.

"BOMBARDA MAXIMA!"

Just as the man on offence went to cast, another voice cried out from behind Harry. A bolt of red energy shot past him and impacted against the ground a bit to the man's right. The paved walkway exploded, sending debris everywhere.

But it wasn't random.

As the debris was freed, it all began to hurtle towards the backs of the two wizards attacking Harry, and thus bypassing the shield that was conjured to cover their front.

The man on offence did realize what was happening, and he was fast enough to protect himself, but not fast enough to protect the man beside him. He was struck in the head by a fairly heavy block of stone, and he slumped to the ground like a puppet who'd had its strings cut, clearly unconscious at the very least.

Seizing his opportunity, Harry dove to the side once more, allowing his assailant and saviour to duel. The magic was impressive. The man who'd saved him animated objects and sent them towards his attacker. His attacker blasted them to pieces, only for his saviour to transfigure said pieces into a pack of rabid animals, which drove the masked man back. When Harry came to his feet, he too added his own, less impressive spells to the onslaught, and the masked vigilante turned and tried to flee, but he didn't make it very far before falling.

Harry might not have known it, but the man had been fleeing towards the nearest apparition point. Just as he did so, Aurors apparated into the alley. Needless to say, the man wasn't prepared for a squad of them to appear in front of him, and he fell quickly and without much drama.

Only when he fell did Harry take the time to look around. The man who'd saved him had drawn near now. He was a portly man of rather short stature. Aside from his rotund form, his most striking features were his odd, green eyes --- which oddly resembled gooseberries --- and his silvery, walrus moustache.

"I say, are you alright, dear boy?"

"I'm... I'm fine, sir."

The man frowned. "None of that, none of that. I can see you're a bit banged up." He glanced over Harry's shoulder to the Aurors who were now approaching them. "I imagine we'll be rather... er, held up by questions from these fine gentlemen, but perhaps you'd let me treat you to a late lunch in the Leaky Cauldron? Such bravery should be rewarded, after all." He chuckled, and then inspected Harry more closely. "Not a Hogwarts student, eh?"

Harry had to think fast. He technically was a Hogwarts student, but that was fifty years from now. Of course, the man wouldn't recognize him. "I'm... new to the area, sir."

"Oh," the man's eyes gleamed with interest. "All the more reason to become well-acquainted then. I would be more than willing to help a young boy like yourself out." He extended a hand. "Horace Slughorn. Potions Master and Head of Slytherin House at Hogwarts."

With some trepidation, Harry reached out and took his hand. He was mercifully spared from giving his own name by the Aurors, who chose that moment to intrude on their conversation. They asked a large number of questions about what had just happened, while their dozens of counterparts continued to drive off the central mob of grey-cloaked figures. By now, Harry realized they had merely been a distraction for the number of smaller groups. If not for the millions of other thoughts on his mind, he might have wondered what had happened to the other small groups of terrorists.

***Sometime later, in the Leaky Cauldron...***

Harry had just bottled it, he was certain.

He and Slughorn had spent a significant chunk of time speaking with the Aurors before heading into the pub together. Harry had been briefly tempted to turn down the offer, but doing so would have been quite rude after this man had just risked his own life in the process of saving Harry's.

Once they'd sat down, exactly what Harry hadn't wanted to happen had occurred.

The man had started asking questions, and Harry had to think on his feet.

He was good at that when it came to actions, but not so much with words.

His story had been that he'd lived out of the country with his muggle parents. He had attended school for three years, but then his parents had died in an attack by Grindelwald's forces. It was similar enough to his own backstory with Voldemort, so it came to his imagination easily.

Coincidentally, that was exactly what the attack on the alley had been chalked up to. If Slughorn was to be believed, Grindelwald himself had never attacked Britain. From time to time though, he did send smaller, not-so-experienced squads to Britain as a scare tactic and a way for new recruits to get some experience.

His story had been as unconvincing as it had been vague, as far as he could tell. Once he'd finished, Slughorn sat back and twirled his silver moustache around his finger.

"Charming," he mused. "Can I be completely honest with you, m'boy?"

"Yes, sir."

"I don't believe a word of it." Harry opened his mouth to cut in, but Slughorn raised his hand. He didn't look upset. He actually looked... amused. "I don't need you to spill all of your secrets, I'm just telling you that you need a much more convincing story." He chuckled. "I could help you with that, of course, but you'd need to tell me... a few things."

Harry's eyes narrowed in suspicion. "What kind of things, sir?"

Slughorn leaned forward, seeming to be far more interested now. "Nothing too evasive, I don't think." He hesitated. "Are your parents really... not with us anymore?"

The thought of Harry's parents was suddenly a lot more painful now that he'd actually seen and, on some level, spoken with them. "Yes, sir."

Slughorn winced noticeably and sighed very deeply, dabbing at the corners of his eyes with a napkin. He looked greatly pained, and Harry's proclamation seemed to age Slughorn by at least a decade. "I'm greatly sorry for your loss. I lost my own mother several years ago, you see. My father... well, he died when I was quite young."

"I'm sorry, sir."

"Not to worry, m'boy, not to worry." He seemed to choose his next words very carefully. "You're not from England." It was more of a statement than a question. "You know magic --- you're very talented, at that --- but you didn't recognize the Aurors."

It was true. In the three years Harry had spent in the magical world, they'd never come up in conversation with Ron or Hermione. Apparently, they were a branch of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. They seemed to be something like the wizarding equivalent of the military.

"No, sir. My parents were British. They migrated before I was born."

Whether Slughorn believed him or not, Harry had no idea. It didn't seem to matter, either, as the large man sat across from him didn't seem too bothered in the particulars. "Interesting, interesting. Not from a family that would be important in our world, are you?"

Harry wasn't exactly sure what the man meant by that, but he shook his head. Easier to stay as low-key as possible.

Slughorn nodded thoughtfully. "And you want to stay in Britain?" Harry nodded. "Yes, I can help with that."

Harry's heart skipped a beat. "You can?"

"Yes, I dare say I have enough owed favours to be of assistance."

"You... would?"

Harry wasn't sure why Slughorn might help him. They'd just met, after all. Helping a complete stranger didn't seem very typical. Least of all from a Slytherin. Harry was sure if the man was going to help him, there would be an ulterior motive behind it, but he didn't much care so long as the man could be of some assistance and didn't ask an unreasonable amount in return.

"Certainly," Slughorn said jovially. "I did tell you I lost my father. I know how... unpleasant that is. Why, at such a young age, as well. How old are you, m'boy?"

"Fourteen, sir."

Judging by the look on Slughorn's face, he had expected younger, but he didn't say that. "Right you are, of course. Fourteen... so fourth year at Hogwarts. Hmm... yes, yes, this could certainly work. Yes, I'll help you out. It shouldn't be too difficult, and it would be a shame to see such talent go to waste." He winked at a rather perplexed-looking Harry.

"Talent, sir?"

"Of course, of course. You were doing quite well before I arrived, weren't you?"

Harry frowned. "I couldn't break their shield. I would have died."

Slughorn waved away his protests. "I might be a man of many flaws, but I know talent when I see it. You've got great instincts and a sharp mind. Your spell casting is very good, too. Fast, crisp, precise. Limited, of course, but nothing some reading and... help won't fix." His eyes had an odd gleam as he said the word "help" and Harry could do nothing but wonder exactly why that was. "I couldn't let such talent go to waste," the man continued. "To do so in the wake of your parents' untimely passing." He shook his head sadly. "No, it won't do; I won't have it."

Harry could hardly believe his luck, but he remained skeptical. "What's the catch, sir?"

"Catch?" asked Slughorn with a small, upward twitch of his lips. "Why, m'boy, there's no catch at all. I don't do such a thing for payment." He shot him a rather conspiratorial glance. "Though if you do feel as if you need to repay me to fulfill your unmistakably impressive sense of nobility, I would be... excited to see you in a little group I've put together at Hogwarts." He winked enigmatically. "But I also wouldn't say no to a box of crystallized pineapple." He chortled before becoming a lot more business-like.

"I will need your name though, I'm afraid. Records must be put forth for you to attend Hogwarts, after all." When he saw Harry hesitate, he winked once more. "Any name, m'boy."

"Harry," he answered. If he didn't give his last name, there shouldn't be any problems.

Slughorn twirled his beard. "Harry, Harry. It's rather... muggle."

Harry frowned. "Is there a problem with that?"

"Of course not," Slughorn said reassuringly. "But certain people will be... judgemental. Important people, at that. Perhaps a compromise. Your name is Hadrian, but you much prefer the less garish Harry. Nobody will use your 'real name' anyway. Only the most stuck up of bureaucrats" Harry mulled it over for about five seconds before nodding. So long as people called him Harry, he wouldn't be overly concerned. "Surname?" Slughorn asked, business-like once more.

Potter was out, and Harry quickly dismissed Black as well. If History of Magic was at all accurate, the Blacks were an old family. Binns had referenced them before. So that wouldn't do. Thinking of the Blacks made Harry think of Sirius. Which, in turn, made him think of Astronomy, and a sudden idea struck him.

"Pavonis."

Slughorn blinked several times. "The constellation?"

Harry nodded. He thought it an apt way of honouring his godfather. Taking on a name born of a constellation was as close as he would get to keeping something of Sirius with him.

Slughorn chuckled. "Pavonis, eh? I do like my stars, Harry, I will admit. A fitting name for one whom I have high hopes for. If I have my way, m'boy, you'll be one of the most brightly shining stars I know."

**Author's Endnote:**

**Please don't have a stroke just because I used the name Hadrian.**

**I am aware of how cliche the name is. Harry will only be referred to by that name when speaking to extremely snobbish purebloods who are not openly friends with him. Harry Pavonis also just doesn't sound right, for some reason. The conflict of syllables, I think. That and, if truth be told, I rather like the idea of writing what I hope will be a well-written fic with the name Hadrian, since most of the ones out there are awful, hence the horrible stigma surrounding the name. I find the idea oddly amusing, and Slughorn's point about appealing to the purebloods with a more wizarding name is very in-character for him, in my opinion. See the way he was surprised by Lily being muggleborn for evidence of this.**

**I won't spill why Slughorn helped Harry, but the hints are there. For now, we shall call it an investment in talent. The man is a collector and an opportunist at heart.**

**Finally, Harry might have seemed very ignorant in this chapter, since he was unaware of Apparition as well as Aurors, and his spell selection was very limited. This is because, in canon, all of this was true until year 4. Harry will be competent, just give him some time. Character development is rather fun, after all.**

***August 9, 1942***

***The Home of Horace Slughorn***

***6:43 PM***

The sound of utensils clinking against plates slowly died at the lavishly decorated table that dominated Horace Slughorn's dining room. The man in question had finished his meal some time ago, but his young charge was a rather slow eater. He never did eat much, either --- Horace usually needed to coax him into eating three meals at all. Considering this, he was more than willing to wait for the young boy before him to finish, so long as he did indeed consume his meal at some point.

The young boy in question, Harry Potter --- now Hadrian Pavonis --- reflected on the last nine days spent at Horace's not-so-humble abode.

After the conversation that followed the attack on Diagon Alley, Horace had agreed to house Harry for a short period of time. During which, he would be searching for a more suitable home for him long-term while he wasn't at Hogwarts.

And Merlin was Harry happy that Horace had somehow gotten him into Hogwarts. He had no idea how the man had done it; all he knew was that his Hadrian Pavonis alias was now a full-blown identity that could withstand a thorough, legal investigation. He hadn't asked many questions. Horace had given a vague answer about the perks of having friends in high places and Harry wisely hadn't inquired any further.

He was skeptical though. He had been adopted once before and that hadn't gone at all well. Being starved and shut up in a cupboard for most of the time spent in the home of that adopted family wasn't exactly a great precedent. He didn't tell any of this to Horace, but the man had still picked up on Harry's nervousness early on and assured him he would make sure he trusted the family Harry was sent to.

That was another thing he was skeptical of.

Why would a wizarding family want to take in some random teenager who they knew nothing about? The Dursleys certainly hadn't been pleased to care for him, and they were actually family. Petunia was, at the very least. Harry failed to see why any unrelated wizarding family would be at all interested in housing him. Horace had never shared these concerns. If half of what the man said was true, he was easily the most well-connected person the former Boy-Who-Lived had ever met. He seemed more than sure he would easily find a family that would be all too willing to take Harry in.

According to him, the difficult part wasn't going to be finding a family who was willing to take Harry. The difficult part would be deciding which family would best suit Harry, both personally and politically.

Harry had looked dumbly back at him the first time the man had mentioned politics, but Slughorn had given him a sort of crash course on the subject.

He was still largely ignorant, but he knew the absolute basics.

The Wizengamot was the governing body of Magical Britain. Wizengamot seats were largely hereditary and there was a complex hierarchy in Magical Britain. Depending on how old and influential a family was, the seatholder for a family would have a designated number of votes. Founding Twelve Houses were at the top of the ladder, with Ancient and Most Noble Houses, Ancient and Noble Houses, Ancient Houses, and simple Houses ranked below them, in that order.

The Founding Twelve families were the descendents of the group credited for the founding of the Wizengamot in 1066 A.D. The body predated the Ministry of Magic by several centuries and it was apparently considered the true founding of Magical Britain. Ancient Houses were families that had been in the country for a designated amount of time, and the two rungs in between were even more complicated. Any family in those groupings had spent the necessary time in the country to be considered an Ancient House, but they had also had a certain number of Order of Merlin recipients, Ministers for Magic, or Hogwarts Headmasters in their history.

Houses were more simple. If a family had the money to pay the exorbitant fees that would annually be required to keep their seat active, they could petition the court to be given status as a House. The petitioning was really just a formality. It almost never failed to pass, since the Wizengamot wasn't exactly shy about collecting more galleons.

Harry had also learned that the Wizengamot was divided into factions, much like most muggle nations. He'd heard Vernon say something one time about how people were always going to divide into factions when given the opportunity. It was apparently in their nature, at least speaking in political terms. Harry had no idea whether or not that was actually true, since he hadn't known a damn thing about politics before arriving here, but he supposed the wizards of Britain were evidence supporting his uncle's argument.

The next major component of the Wizengamot was fairly simple, though Horace had heavily stressed to Harry that he shouldn't just look at the common, uneducated summary. That summary was that there were three factions. The Liberals, the Neutrals, and the Conservatives. Respectively, they were viewed by many as the Light, the Grey, and the Dark.

Horace encouraged Harry to look deeper into the matter. He said that such black and white categorizations were foolish and that they only told a tiny bit of the complex story. Harry was going to stay out of it for the time being, but if it ever became necessary to know more, Horace had given him a book on the matter.

And one on etiquette...

Merlin, Horace had drilled etiquette into him like no other. He implored Harry to continue the practices and progression while at his new family's home over the summer, and he stressed not only how important it would be at Hogwarts, but also that he would likely still be rather far behind his peers.

Harry wondered how different Hogwarts was now as opposed to his own time. He couldn't remember any of that being overly relevant, though perhaps it was a Gryffindor thing. Slughorn was the Head of Slytherin House, after all; something that had made Harry more than a little bit suspicious of the man early in their relationship. Since arriving at his home though, Harry had grown to appreciate Horace greatly and it forced him to somewhat rethink his narrow-minded beliefs surrounding the Hogwarts house system.

Perhaps it wasn't quite as black and white as he had always imagined. Perhaps his dealings with Slytherins like Malfoy, his stooges, Parkinson, and the Quidditch team had been the exceptions, not the norm.

The thought of his own reality sent a sharp pang of sadness through Harry, ripping vigorously through his stomach and clawing viciously at his chest.

Merlin... had he ever botched his former reality.

He would have to make a very conscious effort not to do that this time around. He only hoped that all of this extra nonsense Horace was forcing him to do would be conducive to this goal.

He needed to be better.

He had mostly accepted the fact that his timeline was lost and he would never get it back. That didn't mean he liked it, nor that he was okay with it. But he had very begrudgingly accepted it. In a warped, twisted sense, he was almost grateful for the reset.

Looking into Hermione's and Sirius's unseeing stares had been far too much. He had intuitively known no matter what he did, he would be unable to change that most unfortunate event. After a ridiculous amount of reflection over the past nine days, Harry had realized that a reality in which he had to suffer the consequences of that fateful night wasn't a reality he would look forward to living in.

Not that he was grateful for being thrown fifty years back in time.

He was going to miss much from the world he knew. Ron, for example, would be a loss he mourned, probably for the rest of his life.

And there were other things he would miss as well.

The exhilarating thrill of victory alongside his Gryffindor teammates, who would likely have been his lifelong friends. He would miss summers at the Burrow and the smell of the polish he ritually applied to his Firebolt. He would greatly miss the feel of his invisibility cloak, its liquid-like texture flowing effortlessly down his skin, consuming him in an impenetrable current of protection.

But Hermione and Sirius... their losses had very nearly broken him. He had realized some time ago that if not for the exceptional circumstances that had seen him thrown headlong into the past, it might well have driven him to madness.

None of this was to say he was over being thrown back in time. He still dreamt horrible dreams about the future that could have been. He saw horrible visions every time he closed his eyes. Visions of a resurrected Voldemort running roughshod over all of his friends, whispering to Harry that he and he alone could have prevented it. He saw Professor Dumbledore's broken body fall from the astronomy tower. He saw Professor Lupin fall to a purple blur of a spell, one that he did not rise from. He also saw the vision that had haunted him for most of the year; the vision that had served as his dementor-induced hellscape until he had finally and mercifully gotten a handle on the Patronus Charm.

His mother pleaded with Voldemort before Harry's world was consumed in the same green light that had cruelly taken her away from him.

"Are you alright, m'boy?"

Harry's head snapped up, hardly registering what the man across from him had said. He blinked several times, trying not to look nearly as dazed as he felt. "Sorry," he mumbled. "I was lost in thought. What was it you said?"

Slughorn frowned. "I was simply asking whether or not you were alright."

"Oh, I'm fine, sir. Thanks for asking."

Slughorn's frown deepened as his beady eyes narrowed, but he didn't press Harry on it either. "I have news," he said in a businesslike tone of voice.

"News?"

"Yes, news."

Harry could have rolled his eyes.

Along with etiquette and politics, Horace had spent a very large amount of time tutoring Harry in Potions since his arrival in his home. Harry had mentioned his disdain for the subject during one of their first conversations and the Hogwarts Potions Master had been suitably appalled. He'd since taken it upon himself to not only ensure that Harry was actually competent in the subject --- something he most certainly wasn't before the beginning of his most recent bit of instruction --- but also to put at least a dent in the dense wall of disdain he held for the branch of magic.

Much of which could admittedly be solely blamed upon a tall, greasy-haired man who wasn't even born yet.

With a tinge of utter revulsion, Harry wondered whether or not Snape's parents might be attending Hogwarts. Not that he knew if Snape's parents were even wizards, but he somehow had a hard time imagining the overgrown bat as anything less than a pureblood.

Harry had learned one very important detail about Horace Slughorn during his crash course in potions. One important detail that was blatantly obvious as the man drew out his announcement unnecessarily, a gleam of unmasked amusement sparkling in his dark eyes.

Horace Slughorn had a flair for dramatics, and he had no qualms about flaunting it for the entire world to see.

"What is it, sir?"

"I've found you a foster family."

Harry's mind blanked at the proclamation, hardly even registering Slughorn's grandiose delivery.

He had *already* found a family willing to take in a complete stranger? What on earth had he bribed them with? What kind of connections could he possibly have? Which family was this? Merlin, imagine if it was the Malfoys. No, it surely couldn't be the Malfoys --- anything but the Malfoys.

"W-who is it, sir?" Harry hated the fact his voice shook and he hated even more how the Head of Slytherin House obviously took a savage sort of pleasure in the fact. It validated him and his gift for overdramatizing any given situation to absolutely ludicrous levels.

"The Fawleys," Slughorn said with obvious satisfaction.

Harry's mind quickly raced over the names he knew.

There had been a Fawley during his first year at Hogwarts; a Slytherin whom he was fairly sure had been Head Girl. That was the only Fawley he'd known of in his own time, but he hastily tried to remember anything and everything Horace had taught him about the family.

"They're an... Ancient and Most Noble House, right?"

Slughorn grinned. "Quite a new one, actually. Lord Hector Fawley served as the Minister for Magic for quite some time. Lost the race for re-election three years ago; still a poor vote by the public, in my opinion. Him becoming Minister was the tipping point. It was the last feather they needed to call themselves an Ancient and Most Noble House. Their wealth might not compare to the Malfoys, Notts, or Lestranges --- and certainly not the Blacks --- but they are well-respected by all. They're part of the Neutral Party, and they aren't viewed too poorly by either the Liberals or the Conservatives. It's a great foundation for you.

"It will give you plenty of resources without drawing too much attention. It will introduce you to some important people but not alienate you to one of the major factions before you've decided which set of beliefs best line up with your own worldview ." Slughorn winked. "They also have a daughter who's in your year. Elena is her name. One of my Slytherins. Quiet girl, but she's quite good at Potions. Not a standout, but consistently on point. I have a feeling the two of you would get on swimmingly."

Harry wasn't too sure about that, but he nodded along. He was really going to try to treat Slytherins fairly and try to give them an honest crack. Not that he was going to ignore their track record. He hadn't exactly gotten on with them particularly well in the past.

Or... was it the future?

Gah!

This time, at least he wouldn't have to contend with being the Boy-Who-Lived --- and wasn't that the greatest thing about this new timeline --- but he still wasn't going to allow his hopes to rise too high.

People, in general, had never been his area of expertise. Not that he'd had many of those areas. Quidditch and maybe Defence Against the Dark Arts, he supposed, but that had really been it.

He didn't say any of that to Horace.

Doing so wouldn't be productive. From the very limited amount of reading he'd done, the Neutrals didn't seem too bad. As long as it wasn't the Malfoys or a family of suitably comparable morality, he would have taken it.

He had grown to trust Horace. Not absolutely, by any stretch, but trust nonetheless. He was far more educated on the matter than Harry would likely ever be. He would defer to his judgement and hope beyond hope that Horace didn't lead him astray.

"Do you actually know them, sir?"

"Not closely, but we chat at the odd Wizengamot meeting and have always had a positive relationship. They will treat you well."

Harry nodded solemnly.

He supposed he was going to live with the Fawleys.

***August 10, 1942***

***A Large Home in the Suburbs***

***5:58 PM***

The night was warm and dry and the summer breeze was faint, little more than a whisper across the prosperous green lands that stretched on for many miles. Except for this whispering, plus the occasional rustle of the trees it inspired, all was quiet.

Until a loud crack disturbed the silence and Harry Potter very nearly spilled the contents of his stomach. He fortunately managed to avoid that incident, for the rather vile-looking sick would have completely ruined the picturesque image of tranquillity that his dry heaving had already somewhat fractured.

Horace patted him hard on the back and Harry nearly jumped out of his skin.

He did not like being touched.

After he regained his composure a minute or so later, he straightened up with some trepidation and cast his eyes around the land.

The property he now stood directly in front of was mostly dominated by a very large house. It couldn't quite be called a manor, but 'house' didn't seem entirely right either. The Dursleys --- for all of their numerous faults --- had been rather well off, but the tasteful structure laid out before Harry dwarfed Privet Drive completely. It would have effortlessly cast any home on the street into shadow and shame by its size and beauty, even if it would be unable to stand alongside many of the manors frequented by the most elite of Magical Britain's politics.

This was the second-largest property owned by House Fawley, though only by a small margin. Their premier property, just barely larger than this one, was the home of Lord Fawley and former Minister for Magic, Hector, along with his wife, Hellen. This place, the same place Harry would soon be calling home, was home to Hector's son --- Marshall. Marshall's wife, Melody, also called it home, as did their daughter, Elena.

"Nice place, isn't it?" Horace remarked, leisurely strolling up towards the front door.

Wards would supposedly prevent them from doing that, most of the time, but apparently not tonight. They must have been granted a pass, or something. Harry hadn't known that wards were even a thing until Horace had educated him when discussing homes in the magical world. He still knew next to nothing about them, but he did at least now know they existed, which he considered a drastic improvement from complete and total ignorance.

Harry had also learned that most prestigious families had fairly impressive libraries. Horace had assumed the Fawley's main library would be located at their ancestral family home as opposed to this one, but he had said it was likely that a large portion of their collection was stored here, since the house was home to the family's youngest member. Harry really hoped this was true, and he hoped they would let him read those books if they were indeed there. He wasn't Hermione by any means, but lately he had truly begun to realize exactly how far behind he was.

It was actually quite terrifying.

"It is nice, yeah," admitted Harry, allowing his vivid eyes to roam cautiously over the property.

Slughorn chuckled. "Loosen up, m'boy. Anybody worth anything in this country could tell exactly what you were thinking right about now. At least make them use Legilimency."

Harry paused in mid-stride. "Use what, sir?"

Slughorn suddenly looked rather tired as he rubbed at his temple. "I shouldn't have said that. Put it out of your mind, dear boy. Not something I should be letting slip around students. Highly-regulated magic, it is."

When he had first arrived in the past, Harry would have easily been fooled. Now, he wasn't sure. He was far from positive that Slughorn had just manipulated him, but he thought he might have. The look in his eyes hadn't been appropriate for the situation. It had almost looked as though he was satisfied. As if he wanted Harry to look into Legilimency.

He supposed it didn't matter.

He was definitely going to do that now, whether Slughorn liked it or not.

Much of dinner with Horace and the Fawleys was more awkward than Harry would have liked. There wasn't any one thing that made it awkward, aside from the obvious; he just wasn't an overly social person. Meeting new people had always been difficult. Horace had admittedly been an exception, but it had been vaguely similar to the incident with Hermione and the troll back in first year. Escaping mortal peril alongside another person tended to forge a deep connection that was hard to quantify.

Even then, Harry hadn't opened up beyond the absolute necessities, for the most part, and he was still very cautious while in conversation with Slughorn.

These Fawleys were completely new to the equation and they hadn't had anything suitably exciting happen that quickly bonded them to Harry.

All three of them were brunettes. Marshall had dark brown hair and sea-green eyes. Melody possessed light brown hair with warm brown eyes. Elena --- who was apparently in the same year as Harry --- had soft features, pale skin, her mother's hair and her father's eyes. Just as Horace had observed, she seemed quiet. She had scarcely said a word to Harry since he had arrived, though it wasn't exactly as though he could say much differently about himself.

"Hogwarts letters should be arriving soon," Marshall commented, glancing meaningfully in Slughorn's general direction.

The man nodded, an obvious smile tugging at the corners of his lips. "I dare say they'll arrive shortly, yes."

"Do you have a favourite class in school, Harry?" asked Melody.

Harry was immensely grateful the Fawleys weren't calling him Hadrian. They were an Ancient and Most Noble House and he hadn't been sure how stuck up they were going to be. He was thankful though, for he wasn't entirely sure he would be able to resist the inevitably intoxicating urge to punch the first person to call him Hadrian in the face.

"Definitely Defence Against the Dark Arts," he replied. "So long as Hogwarts is anything like Ilvermorny, that is."

That was the story. He was a European-born wizard who had spent much of his youth in America. His parents were initially British --- hence his accent --- but had raised him in America. In the last year, they had moved to Scandinavia for work, but both of them had died during a raid in Helsinki orchestrated by Grindelwald and his forces.

That attack had actually happened, and there were enough unidentified victims that his story was viable.

It was a good story, Harry thought. The only downside was that he'd needed to read up on his supposed school.

Ilvermorny had four houses to compare to Hogwarts' four. The Horned Serpent represented the mind and Harry liked to think of it as Ilvermorny's Ravenclaw. The sharper minds seemed to end up there, judging by what he had read.

Wampus was the house associated with the body, and it was said to be the house of warriors. This seemed the most like Gryffindor to Harry, and it was the house Horace had chosen for him. He was supposedly going to be branding Harry as an extremely talented Defence Against the Dark Arts student who had shown aptitude on the battlefield, whatever the hell that meant.

He hadn't questioned it; it was far easier not to.

Pukwudgie was associated with the heart, and many of the healers who graduated Ilvermorny had come from that house. From what he had read, Pukwudgie seemed to be comparable to Hufflepuff, in many ways. When first reading about the Ilvermorny houses, Harry had remarked that even the two ridiculous names --- Hufflepuff and Pukwudgie --- were equally comical.

The house Harry thought he probably would have been sorted into had he actually attended Ilvermorny was the house of the Thunderbird. The house represented one's soul, and it was said to be the destination for adventurers. Judging by Harry's first three years at Hogwarts and his intense, natural curiosity, that was most certainly where he thought he would have landed. Which was ironic, because he guessed his previous groupings meant this was Ilvermorny's version of Slytherin.

He told the Fawleys all of this, except for his own reflections on where he thought he fit, as Melody used the opportunity to ask him about Ilvermorny. He had to try very hard not to look nervous, but Horace gently guided the topic of conversation away from that particular line of questioning.

Which was good, as both Marshall and Melody were watching him very intently. Not that he could blame them, given the current set of circumstances.

So was Elena, for that matter.

She hadn't been at first, but ever since Harry had mentioned his interest in Defence Against the Dark Arts, and particularly since Slughorn had gushed about his natural ability, she had watched him with obvious interest and blatant curiosity.

It had been quite the shift from the shy, resigned-looking girl before the comment.

***August 11, 1942***

***The Secondary Library of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Fawley***

***8:47 AM***

Harry had lost track of time.

He must have, for he could not remember the sun rising.

When he'd first entered the spacious library... he wasn't sure how long ago, the sun was most certainly not up.

The dinner had stretched on for quite some time. They had been served a three-course meal, plus dessert. This might not have been the Fawley's main property, but it was still staffed by a house-elf. Harry was quickly getting the feeling that though Horace might not have cited them as being obscenely rich, the family still probably put anyone he had ever called a friend to shame in the department of monetary holdings. And Hermione's parents had both been dentists, so that was a fairly significant statement.

When dinner had ended, Harry had been given a brief tour and was assigned a large room overlooking the lush green lawns. It was more space than he had ever imagined having and he frankly had no idea what to do with any of it. Especially now that he had no possessions aside from his wand and numerous clothes Horace had bought for him the day after he had landed in the past. This wasn't at all suspicious to the Fawleys as --- according to his story --- his home had been destroyed in the Grindelwald raid whilst he had been out with friends. They said they would be giving him gold to get a full wardrobe when he and their daughter, Elena, went to Diagon Alley after receiving their Hogwarts letters.

He hadn't stayed up long after dinner. He wasn't a social person, and trying to trick himself into thinking he was one for several hours had exhausted him more effectively than he would ever care to admit. Being an early riser as it was, going to bed earlier had only meant he rose that next morning at a time that, if you asked most people, would be classified as more than a little bit preposterous.

After getting dressed and showering, he made a beeline for the library. It had been his goal to do just that last night, but he had been entirely too fatigued to reliably absorb any new information.

The room containing numerous shelves was spacious, if not admittedly jaw-dropping. It paled in comparison to the Hogwarts library, though that was to be expected. Hermione had said more times than Harry could count in the three years he'd known her that more books were housed at Hogwarts than anywhere else in the country. This room wasn't anywhere close to being as large as the one in the fabled castle, but it did contain an extremely impressive collection of books and it would more than keep Harry busy for the rest of the summer, even if he did nothing else but read.

He had searched the shelves for some time before settling on a book on defensive magic. It was one he had never seen before, though he supposed that was hardly surprising. It wasn't exactly as though he had ever put a whole lot of time into extracurricular studies.

Evidently, he had become more fixated on the book than he'd initially realized.

When the soft clearing of a throat from nearby jolted him, drawing his attention away from the page in front of him, Harry winced and was forced to blink spots from his eyes as sunlight suddenly accosted him, streaming freely through the large window nearby. He hadn't even noticed the sun had risen.

Upon a brief glance up to the large clock on display, he realized that it was just past a quarter to nine. That meant he'd been in the library and taking notes for more than three hours.

"What are you reading?"

Elena's voice was very soft, but he noticed right away it wasn't timid. That was interesting, for he had pegged her as being quite shy when first meeting her last night.

"Just a book on Defence," he answered, holding it up for her inspection.

Her eyebrows knit together. "You've gotten pretty far into it."

Harry suddenly looked rather bashful. "I've... er, been down here for a while."

"How long is a while?"

He shrugged. "About three hours, give or take."

He had to suppress a grin as the girl's eyes looked as though they might bulge out of her head in surprise. "Three hours?" she asked faintly. "That means you were up before six! People say I get up ridiculously early and I never get out of bed before seven-thirty."

"I was actually up before five."

Harry had literally no reason for admitting this other than to see her reaction, but he thought it would likely be amusing enough to validate his lone justification. It didn't disappoint, and he found himself cracking up at the gobsmacked expression upon her face. It was as though she had come to the unexpected revelation that she was looking at an alien with multiple heads and green skin.

Given that he was from fifty-plus years in the future, he supposed it wouldn't have been too far off; though he didn't think green skin would suit him.

"Something has to be wrong with you," muttered Elena. Her words had the odd effect of causing Harry to sober almost at once. Oh, if this naive girl only knew... "You said you were interested in Defence, right?"

The question caught him a bit off guard, but he recovered quickly enough. "Uh... yeah, I am; it's my favourite subject. Why do you ask?" Elena blushed slightly but muttered something about it being hers as well. "You're going into fourth year, right? Same as me?" She nodded. "Have you read this, then?"

"Part of it."

"How far did you get?"

"Not as far as you. I stopped pretty early on and was trying to get the Protego Shield Charm to work. I never quite got it, but I haven't tried in a couple of days."

Harry felt thoroughly bewildered and his expression reflected this quite perfectly. "A few days ago? I thought you couldn't cast magic during the summer holidays?"

"That's sort of complicated." Elena seemed to consider how best to explain when Harry's look of intense confusion and curiosity did not so much as falter. "How did it work in America, just so I can compare?"

Thank Merlin Horace had forced Harry to look into that. The Statute of Secrecy was enforced very strictly in America. So much so that they made the English protocols look positively lacklustre in comparison. They had suffered horrible conflicts between wizards and muggles far more recently than Magical Britain. Because of this, their restrictions were as numerous as rabbits and as rigid as a board.

"We were never allowed to use any magic out of school until we were of age. Wizards and muggles weren't even supposed to know each other."

Harry suddenly realized that he had no idea how that worked concerning muggleborns and really hoped Elena didn't ask. That was something he was desperately going to need to look into, at some point.

Mercifully for him, she just began her explanation. "Well, that's what they tell you here, as well. At the end of every year, we all get notes saying not to cast any magic outside of school or the Ministry of Magic will know." Harry could sense the 'but' coming. "Well, England has something called the Trace, but it isn't that great at its job."

Now Harry was extremely confused.

He knew exactly what the Trace was. He had even suffered its wrath back during the summer before his second year when Dobby had tried so very hard to prevent his return to Hogwarts. On that occasion, the Trace had been very successful in instantly alerting the Ministry of Magic that underage sorcery had been performed.

Though, he supposed it had failed in its identification of exactly who had cast the magic.

Come to think of it, how did that work?

He really needed to think things through sometimes. It was a wonder he hadn't gotten himself killed before now, even ignoring the spectacular sets of circumstances he always seemed to find himself in.

"What do you mean by that?" he asked with an extreme amount of caution and curiosity.

"Well, the Ministry can't track whether or not a specific person is casting magic. That's literally impossible." That would certainly explain how they had incorrectly assumed him the perpetrator of the Hover Charm, though it still didn't explain how the Trace actually worked. "It works on areas. So if a spell is cast in a mostly muggle area where a muggleborn lives, the Ministry obviously knows who did it."

Ah... yeah, that would do it alright.

"It doesn't work too well with purebloods though," Elena continued. "They only know that magic is being cast. The problem is that when there's more than one person there who can cast magic, they can't be sure who it is; and it's not as if they can just send a notice any time Mother or Father cast a spell. They sort of just rely on pureblood parents to enforce the rule."

Dear Merlin, that was an awful system.

"Isn't there like... a lot of problems with that system?" asked Harry.

"If you're not a pureblood or at least a halfblood, then yes, there are a lot of problems."

"Couldn't you like... frame somebody for underage magic? Or just kill in a muggle area and get away with it?"

"Well, you can challenge an underage magic claim. If you get to the Ministry quickly enough, they'll be able to put your wand through Priori Incantato."

"Put it through what?"

"Priori Incantato. It's a spell that makes a wand show all of the spells it's recently cast. Most wizards can only make the spell show magic over the last few hours, though. You could submit a pensieve memory, but there's a verification process you need to pay for that is ridiculously expensive. I'm not even sure my family could afford it, and we're pretty well off. Apparently, they make it so expensive because it's a pain to do and they don't want to use it in every trial because of that. Plenty of people say it's just because the Wizengamot is so corrupt. Honestly, they have a point."

Harry might have been an idiot when it came to most things --- politics very much included --- but he certainly thought the entire system screamed of corruption. "So your parents let you cast magic?"

"As far as I know, most pureblood parents let their kids cast magic. All of the traditional ones, at least."

Harry wondered if by 'traditional' she meant old families like the Blacks. Or whether she meant the families who were blood purists.

"So... I could practice magic, then? Or are your parents only going to let you do it?"

"Don't be ridiculous," Elena chided. "If they're going to let me do it, of course they'll let you do it. It would be unfair if they didn't."

It was a testament to just how horrible his childhood had been that she instinctively rebuffed the idea as if it were foolish. In reality, it was an accurate summary of how Harry had lived ten of his first eleven years.

"What was the spell you were having trouble with?" he questioned, wanting to switch the topic away from one that might force troubling memories to the surface of his mind. "The Protego Charm, you said?"

"Yeah, it's a late fifth-year spell, I think. It's a pretty powerful shield charm. A lot of Aurors even use it."

Harry had actually just read about that spell a few pages back, so finding it again wasn't particularly difficult. The incantation was Protego and the wand movement was a tight, circular motion in front of one's own body. Shrugging, he stood and raised his wand, drawing the movement in the air a few times before properly committing to an attempt.

"Protego!"

The air shimmered weakly, though it looked more as though whatever he had just tried to do had sparked right out.

Despite this, Elena looked surprised. "You almost did it?"

Harry shrugged. "Did I? I have no idea."

"Yes, you did. You were closer than I ever got, at least. I never got that effect." She eyed him critically. "How good are you at Defence? I know you said you were interested in it, but I got an O in the class last year and even I didn't do as well as you, and that was your first try."

Harry suddenly looked rather uncomfortable. He had never been particularly fond of talking about himself. "Uh... I'm pretty good, I think? We had an obstacle course as our final exam and I was the first in my year to finish."

Elena glanced from Harry to the clock. "Would-would you like to practice later?"

Harry's ears perked up. "I'll practice now if you'd like," he said excitedly.

She smiled. "It will have to be a bit later. Mother wants us at breakfast because these just came in."

She held up a familiar-looking envelope and Harry had to try very hard not to grin like a madman. Given his alleged backstory, it might have been a bit out-of-character.

The envelope she held was one composed of yellowish parchment and Harry immediately knew what would be inside.

Sure enough, his suspicions were confirmed as soon as he ripped open the letter on the way to the house's main dining room.

*Dear Master Pavonis,*

*We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted*

*at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than August 20.*

*Yours sincerely,*

*Albus Dumbledore,*

*Deputy Headmaster*

Oh... wow --- Dumbledore wasn't even the Headmaster yet.

Merlin, this was going to all be very odd.

***August 15, 1942***

***Diagon Alley***

***2:53 PM***

Harry and Elena had formed an odd sort of bond ever since that first morning in the library.

It turned out that Elena actually was shy, but not in the way Harry had suspected. She had a hard time meeting new people, largely because she hadn't had many friends before. Not so much because she couldn't make them as much as because she'd chosen not to. She had been altogether quite elusive on the subject and Harry hadn't pressed. Still, he had put together some things.

The best he could work out was that her parents were very busy people and, though she had always been treated well, she had never been given a whole lot of attention when she was young. Harry thought she might have grown fond of her quiet sort of peacefulness and intentionally done nothing to rupture it up until now.

Once the ice had been broken between the two of them, their relationship had formed with surprising swiftness. Harry was very far from trusting her completely, and he knew all too well the same could be said in reverse. But they'd definitely struck up a friendship, one nurtured by a very large number of hours spent practicing defensive magic. During that time, Harry had actually mastered the Protego Shield, something he was very proud of. Elena hadn't quite gotten it yet, but she was fairly close, and would unquestionably have it mastered by the time they arrived at Hogwarts.

It turned out that, like him, she was most interested in Defence Against the Dark Arts. For her, it was because she one day wanted to become a professional duellist. Harry would never have guessed it from her demeanour, but he could see why. He was unmistakably the more talented out of the two of them, in the sense that he could master spells faster, but their duels were very close despite that. The first few times they'd duelled, Harry had lost. This wasn't that surprising, as the only experience he ever had duelling was against Malfoy at the only meeting of the briefly reformed Hogwarts Duelling Club.

After he had gotten the hang of duelling and learned the Protego Shield, the tides had turned. He had progressively started winning more and more of their duels and he beat her more often than she beat him now. Their duels were still extremely competitive and oftentimes, they were spent mostly in a deadlock. The shield helped him greatly and Elena said that Harry just had a 'scary aptitude' for duelling. She predicted that once he got the hang of it, he would be beating her and everybody else in their year easily. This didn't deter her career aspirations in the slightest. In her mind, it just meant she would have to work harder.

She also seemed to view him as being some sort of prodigy not to compare herself to, which he personally thought was preposterous. He also thought --- rather painfully --- that Hermione would have laughed herself to sleep if she ever heard anyone call Harry a prodigy, whether it only be in one subject or not.

By the time the two of them touched down in Diagon Alley after taking the floo --- an experience Harry was only mildly more comfortable with than the last time he'd used it --- he could easily say she was the closest friend he'd ever had outside of Ron and Hermione. Seeing as they'd known each other for all of five days, that was actually very depressing, but Harry didn't think about it too long. As he had learned of late, dwelling on dark, unpleasant thoughts was not at all conducive to one's mental health or stability.

Elena had even voluntarily waited for his eyesight to be fixed, a process they had no idea as to the duration of.

Horace had been insistent that Harry get it fixed. There were apparently ways of fixing it; they were just very obscure and very expensive. He'd said one of the ways to fix it was through Alchemy, but one had to be obscenely skilled to make that happen. He had been sure he would find somebody who could do it though and he had come through. The Fawleys would even cover the cost of it, as well as all his school things, clothes and any books he wanted to buy whilst he was out.

He really did like the Fawleys. They were remarkably kind, if somewhat distant guardians, especially compared to the Dursleys. He didn't even so much mind the distant part. Distance had always meant safety for much of his life, after all.

As the procedure had been going on, Harry had barely been keeping track. It was very complex and rather confusing. The only thing that baffled him and Elena more than the procedure was the man who had carried it out.

They had walked into a room in the Leaky Cauldron that had apparently been rented out for the man. He was supposedly from America, so he would need somewhere to practice out of.

When they walked in, they both blinked at the sight.

The room had been altered by a very powerful Spatial-Expansion Charm and it was full of all sorts of things.

But that wasn't the baffling part.

The baffling part was the man who stood in the middle of it, scratching his head as he mumbled to himself.

"Job, fun, job fun, job or fun. Hm... money or freedom, money or freedom." Then, he seemed to perk up. "Ha! Oh Reginald, you foolish man. You've been thinking about it all wrong! Money and freedom! Nobody will be able to contain you! Those idiots won't know what hit them if they try---" then he spotted Harry and Elena. Harry had expected him to look embarrassed, but this couldn't have been further from the truth.

His countenance shifted so suddenly, Harry wondered whether this strangely muttering man might have suffered from some sort of multiple-personality disorder. Instead of his muttering and scheming, as well as an overall mad-scientist sort of demeanour, he was suddenly stone-cold and deadly serious.

Granted, the latter image was ruined by his attire, which leant itself much more naturally to the former.

He was wearing a comically large, shining white lab coat that was obviously several sizes too big for him. He wore tight pants underneath and rather expensive looking dress shoes as if he wanted to show off.

The man himself was about six-feet tall. He had a lean, lanky sort of build with short black hair and light blue eyes. Eyes that narrowed upon Harry and Elena as he closed the door with a lazy flick of his wand, stepping closer to the pair of them while he spoke in a comically serious voice.

"My name is Reginald Edward Gress," he began. "Your name is apparently Hadrian James Pavonis, which is completely and totally absurd!" The man scoffed. "Hadrian? What kind of name is Hadrian? Damn you Brits, adding to the utter ridiculousness that has plagued our world. Honestly, Hadrian." He sounded as if the fact genuinely offended him, and Harry had to try very hard not to blush.

"This is exactly why this world would be so much better if everybody would just shut up and ask me for advice. We would be so much further ahead if people just started asking me for advice." He paused. "I wasn't going anywhere with that, I just find the name Hadrian hilariously ridiculous."

The man's posture suddenly stiffened as his attention refocused on Harry, as though he had spaced out and suddenly been brought back down to earth.

"Right, you --- Hadrian James Pavonis." He chuckled. "Hadrian, honestly, the idiocy of some people." He shook his head as if to clear it. "Well you, Hadrian," his lips twitched but at least this time he didn't laugh, "had the common sense to come to me for help. So I shall prove the validity of my ramblings by making all of your problems disappear!"

He snapped his fingers theatrically before suddenly looking puzzled. "That is, of course, as soon as you tell me why it is you're here? It seems to have slipped my mind."

"Right piece of work he was, huh?" Harry asked as he and Elena once more circled back to the enigmatic Reginald Edward Gress in a conversation several hours later.

They had just exited Flourish and Blotts. Harry now also had a new trunk that was enchanted to hold far more on the inside than the out but to still be featherlight. It wasn't obscenely spacious inside. You couldn't live in it, or any such nonsense, but it did hold a lot of things. Thankfully, books were one of them, because he had bought a lot of books. He had been a bit reluctant to spend the Fawleys' money, but he *really* wanted books, and Elena's coaxing had been *really* convincing.

"He was... something," Elena noted. "I have no idea what that thing was, and I sort of hope we never see it again, but he did at least fix your eyes."

"Yeah," said Harry, running a hand over his face.

He was still in complete and utter awe that he could now see the world around him without his glasses. Even more so by the fact it seemed sharper now than ever before. And still, he was even more shocked that the person who'd cured it seemed to be some lunatic in a lab coat who had truly turned out to be every bit the mad scientist he appeared as.

"What's next?" asked Harry.

"Madam Malkin's," answered Elena. "I've grown a bit over the summer and need new robes and you pretty much need a full wardrobe. We'll get you an owl after that. The family one is used by my Grandfather, so I have a personal one. There's really no reason why you shouldn't have an owl of your own. I'm sure Mother and Father won't mind."

"You're positive of that, right? They've already spent a lot of money on me, and I would hate to make them upset."

Elena gave him an odd yet exasperated look. "Honestly, Harry, it will be fine. I have no idea why you're so paranoid. It's like you expect them to curse you for the smallest things."

Oh, if only she knew.

The cynical part of him wanted to spout out exactly why he thought that and see her reaction. The other, more rational ninety-five percent of his brain never wanted anybody to know about that, so he held his tongue.

When they entered Madam Malkin's, they were greeted by the woman whom Harry thought likely owned the shop. She wasn't the same one as the woman he had met in his timeline. "Anything I can help you with, dears?"

"He needs to be fitted for Hogwarts robes," Elena told the woman without preamble. "I need new robes too, but I have my measurements already. I'll just browse while he gets fitted, if that's okay?"

She sounded rather unsure near the end, which didn't surprise Harry. She did not like talking to strangers. In the short time she'd known Harry though, she had learned he detested it far more. Where she disliked it and found it mildly unpleasant, she could tell it made him nervous and uncomfortable, so she had taken the metaphorical bludger for him on this one.

"Of course, dear," the woman replied. "Just do let us know if you find anything you'd like to take with you. We'll get this one sorted in no time. Follow me, dear. Another student is being fitted for new robes as we speak."

Indeed there was, as Harry saw when he stepped up onto the stool next to her.

She was a very tall girl with pale, perfect skin, long, straight dark hair and dark blue eyes. Not a hair seemed out of place on her head, and her countenance was completely and totally blank before he stepped up beside her, at which point he realized just how tall she was, and suddenly hoped she was a lot older than him. She was taller than any girl he'd seen at Hogwarts and the difference between the two of them was rather embarrassing.

"Are you a Hogwarts student?"

Even her voice seemed perfect. Was she just a robot? She had no obvious flaws, whatsoever. Seriously, there wasn't a blemish nor a hair out of place. Even her robes looked pristine. Her voice was soft and smooth, and it seemed to have a naturally cool undertone. Despite this, it was perfectly modulated and conveyed the perfectly appropriate amount of polite interest. It still somehow sent a shiver up Harry's spine, even if he didn't quite know why.

It took him a minute to remember she had asked him a question, but he hastened to answer once he did so. "Uh... yeah, Hogwarts. You?"

She nodded slightly. "I go to Hogwarts, yes. I'm a fifth-year student, how about you?"

"I'm going into my fourth year."

She tilted her head, obviously wanting a better look at him. He shuddered. Her eyes seemed to be x-raying him in a way not even Snape's had been capable of. They were as calculating as they were intense and Harry instinctively looked away from them.

"I don't believe we've ever met," the girl said slowly. "I have a rather good memory, and I don't remember ever seeing you at Hogwarts."

"This is my first year at Hogwarts," Harry explained quickly, supposing this was as good a time as any to begin rehearsing this explanation. "I went to school at Ilvermorny in America. My parents were born in Britain but did a lot of travelling for work. We ended up back in Europe but they... didn't make it out of a raid."

The older girl's expression softened and those eyes suddenly looked more compassionate than calculating. "I'm sorry to hear that," she said, and she truly did sound it. "Was it a muggle or magical raid, if you don\'t mind me asking?"

"Magical," said Harry, noticing how the woman fitting his robes seemed to tense at the confession. Hardly a surprise after Grindelwald's forces had terrorized the alley barely more than two weeks ago. "Why do you ask?"

This was similar to the conversation he had shared with Draco two years ago in this establishment... wait, was it forty-nine years in the future?

Gah! This time shit was brain-numbing.

Nevertheless. Draco had also subtly asked him about blood status. Well, what the blond had considered subtly, at least. This girl's probe was far less obvious in hindsight, and Harry would never have realized it might be a probe at all if not for that previous encounter.

"I was only curious because I've experienced the muggle raids." That had not been the answer Harry was expecting to hear. "I meant no disrespect by the question, and I'm sorry if it came across that way. I wasn't trying to learn your blood status and look down on you for it, or any such nonsense. I was just curious whether or not we might be able to relate to one another."

She sounded so innocent that Harry felt guilty for suspecting her. "No, it's okay," he said hastily. "There's no need to apologize. Are you a muggleborn, then?"

The girl stiffened for what must have been only a fraction of a second, but her voice lost none of its confidence as it answered. "Halfblood. Both of my parents are dead."

Oh, wow... the two of them seemed to have a peculiar amount in common. A seemingly mutual distaste for blood purity and similar backgrounds. That was interesting. "I'm... sorry about that."

The corners of the girl's mouth twitched. "In four years of hearing that over and over again, you might be the first person to say it and it actually mean something."

He could relate to that... Merlin, could he relate to that. "Same here, actually."

The girl smiled as both of them stepped down from the stool, just as Elena walked around the corner and froze at the sight of them. Harry thought her reaction was odd, but his attention was caught by the girl in front of him when she began to speak once more. He looked up at her, and that was even more disconcerting now that he was on flat ground. Girls did hit their growth spurts first though, and she was older than him. Still, it made him more uncomfortable than he would care to admit. He disliked feeling as though he was at a disadvantage.

"Hogwarts is a chaotic place, and I'm sure it will be an adjustment getting used to the castle and all that comes with it." She smiled warmly as she held out her hand. "I would be happy to help you settle in, if you would let me."

Harry suspected Elena would do that just fine and he felt an odd sense of foreboding around this girl. Despite it, he didn't want to be rude, so he took her offered hand and shook. Her grip was shockingly firm.

"I'll keep that in mind, thanks."

She nodded. "Please do. I'm always happy to help..." she trailed off. "I don't believe I ever got your name."

He had to try hard not to bite his lip. She was watching him much too carefully.

"Hadrian Pavonis," he said through a sigh, remembering to his dismay the way Reginald Gress had ruthlessly mocked his name. If only he disagreed with the man, it would have bothered him slightly less. "For the love of Merlin though, just call me Harry."

She laughed a soft, chilling laugh that seemed to be otherworldly in an odd sort of way as she finally released her vice-like grip on his hand, much to his relief. Handshakes were manageable, but he didn't love being touched, and she hadn't released his appendage for quite some time.

"I'll keep it in mind," she quoted him. "My name is Emily Riddle. It's a pleasure to meet you."

Riddle... oh... FUCK!

WHAT THE FUCK!!?

WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK!!?

If he weren't in public, he likely would have allowed himself to give into shock. In his current setting, he did everything he could to not look dumbstruck, but he wasn't sure to what degree, if any, he had succeeded.

And could anyone blame him?

Riddle... as in Tom Marvolo Riddle? Otherwise known as the monster who would later become Lord Voldemort?

Not necessarily, he supposed.

Riddle wasn't a common name, but it wasn't too out there, either. There could be more than one Riddle.

After all, the Riddle he knew of was male...

He was also pale, dark-haired and obscenely tall for his age, at least when they'd met in the Chamber of Secrets.

This reality also seemed to mirror his own in many ways, with small, subtle changes.

Could this be one of them?

Could this be the female version of Tom Riddle?

It had to be; he just had that feeling.

There were so many other possibilities, but they were similar both in appearance and mannerisms. They were equal parts measured and angelic, and they even seemed to speak in a similar manner.

The problem was, he hadn't yet answered the first true question he'd had upon arriving in this new, altered reality.

Was the butterfly effect real and if so, what sort of impact could it have on this reality?

He had no idea.

FUCK!

This Riddle could be different. She could apply the genius she likely still possessed in other areas and turn out to be the next Dumbledore, for all he knew.

Or she could be infinitely worse than Lord Voldemort, more evil and powerful in ways he couldn't even imagine.

Oh, he was so fucked.

This was going to be the biggest mind-fuck of all time and he might well die before it was all said and done.

... or prosper.

GAH! This was impossible!

"Is everything alright, Harry?"

Her damned voice again... why did it pull him so effortlessly from his thoughts? Why did it draw his attention seemingly without any real effort on her part? Why did that concerned look in her dark blue eyes make his heart skip a beat?

GAH!

"It's... nothing. Just had an... odd thought, that's all."

She looked at him with obvious concern, but now he really had no idea whether or not it was real. "You're quite sure it's nothing? You suddenly look quite pale and a bit faint. If there's anything I can help you with, just let me know."

"It's nothing," said a rather hurried-sounding voice from nearby. Elena suddenly stepped up beside Harry, wrapping an oddly protective arm around him and making him tense.

She didn't seem to notice.

She just continued looking up at Emily Riddle. "He hasn't felt well for the past few days."

Emily's eyebrow rose. "Elena? You know Harry already?"

"My family is fostering him."

Emily hummed to herself. "How interesting. Well, if he really isn't feeling well, I would suggest you get him home. I wouldn't want him to suffer any longer on my behalf."

Elena hardly waited for a heartbeat before doing just that. Her rush to get out of the store --- quickly telling one of the shopkeepers to have their things mailed on the way out --- only made Harry even more nervous.

And still, he heard Emily Riddle's parting words clear as day. "I'll see you at Hogwarts, Harry. I look forward to becoming more acquainted."

**Author's Endnote:**

**This is quite a long AN, but first, a friendly reminder that --- as stated in the AN of chapter 1 --- there is no upload schedule for this story. The next chapter is available on my Discord server for those most eager among you, and the next three are up on my P\*T\*E\*N page. But again, these are posted on site only when the audio versions are done as well. Seeing as both my narrator and my video editor are university students, that can take some time. I promise, I am writing this during the breaks.**

**Now, a few things to clear up:**

**Firstly, Master Pavonis was not a typo. Back in the 40s, males in British boarding schools would have been exclusively referred to by this. Some older professors still do this today, according to several people I know that have actually attended these schools recently.**

**Now, because I know the names Liberal and Conservative are going to trigger people, let me explain this. That way if you still try and make this about politics, it just makes you look foolish and I can just not respond to you.**

**The political connotations of those words have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW I CHOSE THEM! I really could not care less about politics.**

**Liberals and Conservatives were chosen because of how they are defined in the English language. According to their definitions, Liberal means progressive and Conservative means traditionalist. Seeing as one faction is trying to maintain the old ways and keep themselves primarily in power, whereas the other is campaigning for change and equal rights for all, I think these definitions are apt.**

**It has nothing to do with politics, so please don't make it a political conversation. That would be saying more about you than the story.**

**Chapter 4: Complicated Riddles**

***September 1, 1942***

***The Home of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Fawley***

***6:03 AM***

Birds chirped happily outside, adding to the striking scene of the sun rising and casting its soft glow upon the large estate dominated by a handsomely lavish house. The sun's warm light caused the early morning dew to sparkle as it tinged the dark horizon a vivid orange.

Inside the large home, one occupant was very much awake, pacing impatiently back and forth across his spacious room, having already showered and dressed some time ago.

Harry Potter could not entirely decide whether he was more excited than he was nervous, or whether he was more nervous than he was excited. No matter which was true, it went without saying that he was extremely anxious; a feeling that only mounted as the sun ascended higher and higher into the still dark-ish sky.

Today was the day he would return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a full forty-nine years before he was technically supposed to attend the institution in question. The idea filled him with excitement, just as it had in his own reality, but he had never been so nervous to return to the ancient castle.

It was his home more than any other place in the world. Even being thrown fifty years back into the past had not changed that. There was little more he wanted than to return to Hogwarts.

Yet, it was going to be different.

It might still be home, but it certainly wasn't going to be the home he remembered. What made it even worse was that he wasn't entirely sure how different it would be. The staff would, of course, be entirely new to him --- except for Professor Dumbledore, who was the Deputy Headmaster and the professor of Transfiguration in these times. The culture was certainly going to be different as well. More formal and less free, he suspected; not just in customs but also the enforcing of the castle's many rules, a practice that had been somewhat lax during Dumbledore's tenure as headmaster.

He would have to act differently because of all of this, inevitably stumbling his way through various practices he had only just learned and had yet to put to the test. From formal greetings to mealtime posture and day-to-day addresses, Harry's social life was going to be vastly different this time around.

All of this was exceedingly stressful, but none of it was the heart of his concerns.

What worried him the most were two things. One may have seemed small to some outsiders, while the other doubtlessly seemed colossal to any who pondered it.

He was entering Hogwarts without a social circle for the first time since his first year. He was not a very social person. Well, that wasn't entirely true. Once he became suitably comfortable around a person, Harry tended to be sociable enough, if still a bit quiet and withdrawn at times. The problem was that he didn't know anyone aside from Elena and his social anxiety was going to be perpetually piqued until that fact changed. Elena didn't have many real friends, so she and Harry were going to be rather alone. He would not at all miss the constant stares brought on by his status as the Boy-Who-Lived, but he would miss the slight sense of social security it granted him. Much as he enjoyed anonymity, he would miss his friends above all else.

He tried his hardest not to think of Ron and especially not of Hermione. Every time thoughts of his two best friends swam sinisterly to the surface of his mind, he attempted to shove them back into the depths with ruthless force. This had been a fruitless practice at first, for their persistence was such that it eventually wore out the part of his brain that had been trying to compartmentalize them away.

The practice had become marginally more manageable, but it was still a struggle even in the best of times. The pangs of loss and sorrow had become no less frequent, but he was slowly starting to become accustomed to the crushing reality of his situation and the horrible truth that he would never see his friends again.

It said a lot about how socially pessimistic Harry was that he viewed all of that as being on par with the threat of somebody discovering who exactly he was --- and where and when he had exactly come from. In particular, he feared a tall, pale girl deducing any of this. In her hands, it could be an infinitely more powerful weapon than the Killing Curse that he'd read about not a week ago.

Another horror Harry had read about was that of Legilimency, the nature of which Harry had yet to decide upon. Perhaps Slughorn's mention of the subject had been advertent, or perhaps it had been a terrible slip of the tongue. He could not be sure which was true, but it mattered not.

Legilimency may have scared him more than anything else, largely due to his fear of being discovered. It was the practice of mental manipulation. One could do a vast number of horrifying things with Legilimency, things that would likely fill the nightmares of many. The ability to read thoughts, see images, and extract memories was one that Harry feared above all others.

All the more because it seemed the exact sort of thing Voldemort would have known, and he had long since decided Emily Riddle could be no one but the female manifestation of Lord Voldemort. Or the female manifestation of Tom Riddle, at the very least. Why he had been thrown into a reality in which Voldemort was female, he had no idea.

If she truly was Voldemort at all.

She had seemed so... innocent. Certainly imposing in her own sort of way --- both through her words and her stature --- but not in the way he would have expected a dark lord to be imposing. Or a dark lady, he supposed; not that he had any experience at all dealing with dark ladies. In a twisted sort of sense, they sounded far more terrible to him than any dark lord who had ever existed.

Emily Riddle hadn't seemed to be a dark lady. Yet, neither had Tom in the Chamber of Secrets, prior to Harry putting the pieces together himself. They both had the same deadly charisma, yet Emily had a natural sort of innocence about her that Tom had lacked. Perhaps it was just Harry being far more familiar with, and thereby suspicious of, males as opposed to females. He really had no idea, but there was an inkling of doubt in his mind as to whether Emily Riddle would ever become the monster he had known as Lord Voldemort.

An inkling of doubt that not even Elena's odd fear of Riddle had completely crushed.

Elena had practically dragged Harry into a dark, deserted alcove near the edge of where the more densely populated, more socially acceptable alley conjoined with its darker, shadier twin as soon as they exited Madam Malkin's.

Once in the alley, Elena's eyes had darted fearfully around as she tried in vain to convey what exactly had made her twitchy without warning. It obviously amounted to Emily Riddle, but she didn't say exactly why. No matter how many times Harry asked, she never answered why.

The rest of the summer holidays had passed quickly. Things one was looking forward to usually crept towards them at a maddeningly slow pace, whereas things dreaded often approached with the swiftness of a speeding bludger, yet with the subtlety of a particularly stealthy wizard garbed in an invisibility cloak.

And by Merlin, was Hogwarts going to be different without the assured protection of his cloak. No longer would he be able to sneak through the halls as undetectable as the most subtle of poisons gently creeping through human veins.

It was just one of a great number of things that would no longer be the same. One of a vast number of things that were different and one of a tremendous number of things that led him to be exceedingly anxious as the time to be present at Platform Nine and Three Quarters swiftly approached.

***About five and a half hours later, on the Hogwarts Express...***

Emily Riddle strode confidently down the train's main hall, her expression completely passive as she continued away from the compartment that had just held the annual prefect's meeting and made her way towards a different compartment. One in which she knew those closest to her would be patiently waiting.

It had been a long summer, seeming to stretch on forever just as all the ones before it had. Every moment spent away from her true home seemed to last twice as long as it was supposed to, and that was before she considered the constant whinging of the young children who occupied the orphanage. There were, at least, no bombings anymore and there hadn't been for some time. That was a small mercy, for those had been the darkest days she had spent locked up in that horrid place.

Emily wiped her mind clean with but a thought and allowed its vast power to be occupied by more productive things --- she had no desire to wallow in such dark and depressing memories. Thoughts of what this coming year at Hogwarts might bring, particularly after the revelations she'd made at the end of her fourth year and her actions over the summer holidays. Revelations that brought her mind back onto the stunning, ancient ring that rested comfortably upon her right hand.

Emily saw that her chosen compartment had indeed been claimed. Her trunk had been moved into the compartment in question and already levitated up into the overhead compartment. It was in a position easy to access, for those in the compartment knew all too well she would likely extract a book at some point during the long, monotonous journey.

There were only four others in the compartment due to the limited amount of space it provided, but that restriction wasn't going to last long. Emily had always found the lack of space in the compartments to be vexing, so she had read up on a way of remedying that during the summer. She had been lent several interesting tomes to occupy herself with whilst at the orphanage and this particular spell had caught her eye. It was quite advanced and she didn't even think the Hogwarts curriculum covered it, but she also had little doubt she would be able to use it successfully.

Emily --- with Felix Rosier, the other new fifth-year prefect trailing not far behind her --- removed her wand from her sleeve. She wove it through the air in a tight, intricate pattern, watching with smug satisfaction as the compartment doubled in size, rapidly expanding before their eyes. Those within looked at her with more than a little bit of awe. For her part, she acted as though this was completely natural, striding casually into the compartment and taking the seat nearest the window.

"How in Merlin's name did you do that?" asked Antonin Dolohov directly across from her.

"Magic. You should know better than to doubt me when it comes to magic." Dolohov recoiled slightly despite her teasing tone as Emily turned to Rosier, who was presently taking the seat to her right. The only thing to her left was the window. "Thank you for the book, Felix. It was very enlightening."

He smiled a thin smile that screamed of hidden implications. "My pleasure, Riddle."

"Go and fetch the others," Emily said with a look towards Dolohov. "Now that there's room, I see no reason we shouldn't all be together." Dolohov scrambled to his feet and hurriedly rushed out of the compartment, leaving Emily alone with Alphard Black and Romulus Lestrange, as well as Felix Rosier.

"How was your summer, Romulus?" Emily asked casually, leaning slightly against the window as she tilted her head to better observe the Lestrange heir.

Romulus shrugged. "Same as ever, really. We spent some time in France, but most of it was spent as normal."

Emily glanced towards the other two, not needing to repeat her question before both of them gave more detailed accounts of their own summer exploits. She was at least pleased to know that they had all taken the time to study the magic she had asked them to.

Dolohov returned minutes later, leading a procession of students into the compartment, all of them looking suitably impressed before taking seats around the expanded interior. When they had all sat, Emily took time to peer over what she liked to think of as her inner circle. She had her hoards of admirers, but this was her core group. The important ones, at least.

From the fifth years, there were the aforementioned Alphard Black, Antonin Dolohov, and Felix Rosier, as well as Silas Mulciber and Cassiopeia Black. There were two members of the fourth and sixth years respectively. From the former, there were Derrick Avery and Blake Selwyn, while the latter's representatives were Nero Macnair and Augustus Rookwood. Emily had her fingerprints all over the fourth year Slytherin contingent, but these were the two whom she trusted most. From the seventh year, Darius Shafiq was present. It was by far the upper year she had the least amount of direct influence in, but nobody in that year was foolish enough to oppose her, either. It was sort of an unspoken agreement that if they didn't meddle in her business, she wouldn't complicate theirs.

"So," Macnair asked with bated breath, leaning forward like a helpless moth ensnared by the alluring power of an open flame. "Why the call, Riddle? Big plans for the year?"

All in the compartment darted their eyes rapidly between Riddle and Macnair. The former's posture didn't shift in the slightest. She merely swivelled her dark, intense gaze to fall upon the sixth year before her, freezing him in place with her stare alone.

"Must there be a purpose, Macnair?"

The boy suddenly looked far twitchier than he had but a moment earlier. "You-you don't do things without a reason," he forced out. Emily nodded slowly along with his hastily spoken words.

She examined him for what must have been about ten seconds before a thin smile slowly crept onto her lips. "This is true," she admitted with an odd gleam in her eye. "How perceptive of you, Macnair. It seems you have me all figured out."

"I don't think any would dare to assume they had you all figured out, Riddle."

Emily laughed a soft, musical laugh. "You flatter me, Augustus," she said lightly. "I do try and avoid becoming predictable. Having others anticipate your actions becomes quite dull, and I am easily bored and not as easily entertained."

Harry and Elena hadn't had any trouble finding an empty compartment clustered somewhere among the number of other, more populated ones dotted throughout the train's spacious interior. Elena seemed to be almost as excited as Harry was himself, though she didn't seem to be burdened with much of the nervousness that was currently gnawing persistently at his innards.

For much of the ride, Harry watched an array of fields stunningly carpeted in an equally vast number of vivid, autumn colours speed by the window as Elena regaled him with enchanting truths about the castle he'd known for some time.

The door to the compartment slid open several hours into their journey and a younger, red-headed girl poked her head inside, interrupting Elena's impassioned story about how her Defence Against the Dark Arts class had struggled a great deal with the boggart the previous year.

"Excuse me," the new arrival said, shuffling her feet and fixing her warm brown stare upon Harry, who stared warily back at her. "Are you Master Pavonis?"

More than a month after being christened with the name, Harry still had to resist the powerful urge to say no. It still didn't quite seem to be his name, but he forced his face to not reflect his inner conflict as he nodded, prompting the girl to step forward and offer him a pristine roll of parchment. The girl exited the room as quickly as she had entered, leaving Elena to peer openly at Harry with an inquisitive expression.

Shrugging to indicate he had no better idea as to the origins of the letter than she did, he unrolled the offending parchment and read it quickly, causing his eyebrows to knit tightly together.

*Harry,*

*I would be delighted if you would join me for a bit of lunch in compartment C.*

*Sincerely,*

*Professor H. E. F. Slughorn*

"An invitation from Slughorn," Harry said with no small bit of bemusement. He'd never heard of a professor riding the train to Hogwarts. He couldn't think of why anyone would do such a thing when they had the altogether more convenient options of floo travel and apparition.

"He invited me last year," she said with a small frown.

"I'm sure your invitation will come," Harry said assuringly, though he had an odd sort of feeling that might not be the case.

Harry very much wished he hadn't been right.

Elena had never gotten an invitation from Slughorn, which left Harry to nervously trudge through the train's main corridor, trying not to become too entangled in the gaggles of students conversing out in the halls. He'd thought he had escaped the constant stares and murmurs when he had inadvertently fled from his Boy-Who-Lived moniker. It turned out this didn't hold quite as true as he would have liked.

Apparently, a new boy who looked quite young but not quite young enough to be a first year drew a fair bit of attention. Harry supposed he couldn't really blame them, much as he detested their pointing and muttering more than they could ever imagine. In his three years at Hogwarts, he was certain there had never been a transfer student. If there had been, he would doubtlessly have heard about it. He did try to keep well away from the incessant Hogwarts rumour mill, but he had also shared a common room with Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil, so doing so completely hadn't been at all possible.

He did eventually find the specified compartment, though he noted with a small pang of embarrassment that he was about three minutes late to the gathering. He had an apology quickly forming on his tongue as he pushed open the compartment door, but it died far more quickly than it could escape when his emerald eyes swept around the room.

It was extremely jarring to see the spitting images of people he'd known in his own time, but still to know they were not and would never be the same. Two of the older students in particular drew his attention.

One of them was a platinum-blond boy with dark grey eyes that could be nobody but an ancestor of Draco Malfoy. Probably a grandfather, if Harry were to guess. The same could be said for the brown-haired boy beside him with the dark, cruel-looking eyes who was practically Theodore Nott reincarnated. Others looked familiar, as well. He thought one of them looked an awful lot like Ernie Macmillan; whereas another still greatly resembled Susan Bones --- an auburn-haired Hufflepuff girl from Harry's old world.

The most jarring similarity of all --- yet still far from the single most jarring sight in the room --- were those who were very obviously the ancestors of his godfather, Sirius Black. Horace had forced upon him a great deal of study in recognizing important people by their common characteristics. There were several students gathered in the compartment with the unmistakable regal air of a Black. Mixed with high, elegant cheekbones and dark, vivid hair, Harry had little doubt, though the fact shook him more than he would care to admit.

Yet none of that shocked him nearly as much as the girl who sat closest to Slughorn himself. Her angelic face, pale skin, dark hair, and intense eyes couldn't be missed and Harry could tell via the eager manner in which Slughorn's eyes darted from Riddle to himself what was about to happen. Irrational dread and mild panic seized tightly around his chest at the same moment he realized he would be able to do nothing to prevent what was to come.

"Harry, m'boy!" boomed Slughorn, crafting no illusion about having never met Harry before today. "Do come in, do come in! Hmm... where to put you? Ah, yes! Right here there's a seat. Right beside this stunning young lady to my right."

Harry knew anything but his immediate acceptance would draw attention he didn't at all want. He tried to stay as calm as possible as he slowly stepped towards the seat to Riddle's right. He wasn't sure how he looked, but he felt as though he was being marched towards his execution. His chest was so tight that it felt as though a boa constrictor had a hold of him. His heart was beating much too quickly, as though it was trying to escape whatever bindings seemed to have appeared around Harry's chest.

Riddle's smile was warm and welcoming as Harry took the seat beside her, a fact that oddly sent his brain spinning. How could anything about the maybe future dark lady be something other than cold and cruel?

"Harry here is new to Hogwarts," Slughorn said cheerfully, and Harry realized to his great discomfort that everyone in the room was watching him closely now. Even more unsettling was the fact Riddle now had a perfectly viable excuse to thoroughly examine him. He felt every gaze, but hers felt like the heat and light of the sun compared to the spectral spotlight of the moon on a mostly cloudy night. One was visible and ominous in its own sort of way, but the other was infinite, inescapable, and often overwhelming.

That was, at least, if the light of the sun was given the ability to function as an x-ray beam. Much like back in the alley weeks ago, Riddle's gaze seemed to pierce his skin and burrow far deeper, as though she was performing a muggle autopsy without the aid of medical equipment.

"Harry here is a transfer student with quite the... tragic past," Slughorn continued, giving them a very brief summary of Harry's fabricated life.

The youth in question did feel a swell of gratitude for his mentor --- if that was indeed the right word --- when Slughorn implored all of them to spread the facts around to the best of their ability. The man hadn't lied about one thing. It really was best for Harry's mental health if he didn't have to repeat the circumstances which had led him here.

There was a long round of introductions and Harry found out his earlier assumptions had been perfectly true. The blond who could have passed as Lucius Malfoy's doppelganger was indeed the current Malfoy heir; he was named Abraxas. The cruel-eyed boy was a Nott named Edward, and several members of the Black family --- Alphard, Pollux, Cassiopeia, Dorea and Arcturus --- were also present. The second-to-last caused a shiver to run down Harry's spine and he had to resist the urge to gape, or to examine her with a clinical precision that would have made the still staring Emily Riddle jealous.

He had seen this girl before. She had popped up several times in the photo album Hagrid had gifted him with at the end of his first year at Hogwarts. Even before that, he had spotted her in the Mirror of Erised on a cold, dreary night late in December of 1991.

Slughorn saved Emily's introduction for last, something that Harry found oddly predictable. The way he looked at her made it very obvious she was his undisputed pride and joy at Hogwarts.

"And this charming young lady is Miss Emily Riddle." Harry could not help but notice that most in the room looked on in adoration while a select few --- like Abraxas Malfoy and Edward Nott --- looked on with something more akin to feigned indifference.

"She's a year above you and a newly-minted prefect. Most well-deserved, I might add." Emily smiled modestly back at Slughorn, not speaking and therefore allowing him to continue his monologue. "Most brilliant young mind I've ever seen, you know. Why, I've been telling Albus for some time that he'd best enjoy his spot atop his podium while he can. He might not be Britain's greatest magician for a whole lot longer."

Some gathered around laughed while Harry saw others hide smirks. Some still looked a bit skeptical, while a few still tried their best at acting indifferent.

Riddle herself merely looked pensive. "That's a very bold prediction, sir," she said, speaking for the first time since Harry had entered the room.

Slughorn chuckled. "Oh, not so bold as you might think, my dear." He winked at her. "I know talent when I see it, and by Merlin, I'm not sure of the last time such talent existed on these isles. Now," he continued, "with the introductions out of the way, let us tuck in!"

The sheer amount of food laid out before them made Harry think painfully of Ron and how his best mate had often complained about the ruthless stab of hunger as they waited for the welcoming feast at the beginning of each new school year. The trolley was a nice and welcome addition to the train, but it had nothing on this. A large table neatly covered in a white linen cloth was the centre point of their loose rectangle. The table was buried under no small amount of food, and Harry idly wondered whether or not he would even be hungry by that evening's feast.

He tuned in and out of the general din of conversation, focusing more on the food in front of him and trying to make himself scarce. Being in a room with several important people he'd never met and knew nothing about was very stressful and the best way of minimizing the feeling was by staying as far out of the conversation as possible. None of the purebloods near enough to speak with Harry paid him any mind, but conversation was eventually broached by the absolute last person in the compartment he presently wanted to speak with.

"Does Ilvermorny have most of the same classes as Hogwarts?" Riddle asked from beside him, daintily dabbing at the corner of her mouth with a napkin as she gifted him with her full, undivided attention and all of the disconcerting feelings that immediately accompanied it.

Harry forced himself to stay perfectly calm as he answered her question with a surprisingly level tone of voice. Well, he forced himself to look calm, at least. His heart was beating quickly again and his stomach seemed to be doing its best to tie itself in knots. "Pretty much, some of them just go by different names."

"Which class do you most enjoy, then? And which electives have you chosen to take?"

"Defence Against the Dark Arts is definitely my favourite. I'm taking Runes, Arithmancy, and Creatures as electives."

"You enjoy them?"

"Well... one of the only classes Ilvermorny didn't have was Runes. I'm interested in them, but not sure how well I'll do."

The part about Ilvermorny not having Runes was mercifully true. Slughorn had been unbelievably persistent that Harry take Runes, Arithmancy, and Care of Magical Creatures. He'd tried to explain to the man he'd never taken Runes and Arithmancy in his life, and that he would be terribly behind in both subjects. Slughorn had not relented even for a second, insisting he would help him catch up in Runes and that Arithmancy wasn't all that difficult if one knew basic muggle maths.

Harry appreciated the value of the subjects even if he didn't entirely understand them. That still didn't mean he was at all looking forward to the Gringotts vault full of stress that would inevitably be involved in catching up to where the rest of the class currently rested in terms of their academic progress.

Riddle nodded, gracing him with a soft smile. "I would be happy to help if you ever fall behind," she offered. "I'm quite good in both subjects; Runes, in particular. It's one of my favourites, actually." Her eyes sparkled. "Defence is definitely my favourite subject as well, though."

Of-fucking-course the maybe-future-Voldemort's favourite subject was Defence Against the Dark Arts.

Oh, the irony.

"Thanks for the offer," Harry said with no intention of ever taking her up on it. "I'll keep it in mind."

"Please do," said Riddle. "Do remember to come to me if you ever find yourself... out of your depths."

"Offering your services already, I see?" Slughorn asked fondly. "Don't take on too heavy a load, my dear girl. This is your O.W.L year. Most prefects take on quite a light load in their fifth and seventh years."

"Thank you for the concern, Professor. I'm sure I'll manage just fine and I'll be sure to scale it back and come to you for help if I ever need it."

She was good --- she was *really* good. Harry could see the way the subtle stroking of his ego caused Slughorn to swell, immediately bending to Riddle's whims.

Merlin... what had Harry gotten himself into.

By the time Slughorn noticed the time, the sun was setting outside the still speeding Hogwarts Express. It beamed through the large window and caused glittering glares to form on the surface of the pristine plates and goblets as it cast long, deep shadows all around the steadily darkening compartment.

"Dear me," Slughorn cried when he saw just how low the sun had stealthily sunk in the sky that now appeared just as orange as it did blue. "Look at the time, look at the time! You all best be getting back to your compartments in time to change. Dear Merlin!"

Harry knew Slughorn well enough to have predicted this outcome. He'd already changed before arriving. As had Emily Riddle, who shot him a conspiratorial sideways smirk, as if she was sharing the joke between just the two of them. It was oddly irritating how normal that gesture was. It was one Harry would have made if sharing a joke with Ron or Hermione.

"Harry, m'boy, stay for a moment, will you? You as well, Emily." Harry tensed for only the barest of seconds as he and Riddle paused in their respective rises back to their feet.

Harry saw Emily nod vaguely to a cluster of students awaiting her at the exit, causing them to close the door. Judging by the sound of footsteps moving away from their compartment, he assumed that gesture had indicated they were to return to their own compartment.

Merlin, people already obeyed her just via nod!

"You wanted to speak with us, sir?" asked Riddle, her face a total visage of complete curiosity and perfect politeness.

"Why, Emily, I always enjoy speaking with you." He chuckled. "Same for Harry here, of course."

Emily's brow furrowed. "I wouldn't have thought the two of you knew each other, Professor? What with his recent transfer and all."

Slughorn just winked meaningfully at her. "Now, now, Emily, you know I can't give up all of my secrets. That would be telling, now wouldn't it?" He laughed a deep, full-bellied laugh."I know Harry here quite well," Slughorn said after regaining his composure. "Spent some time getting to know him over the summer. Great young chap he is, too." Harry tried unsuccessfully not to blush, but Riddle was at least polite enough to pretend not to have noticed.

"He's been through quite the shock as of late," Slughorn continued, "and getting adjusted to Hogwarts will be no small feat."

Oh... fuck! Surely he wasn't about to...

"I was wondering if it might be too much to ask of you to ensure that Harry here adapts to his new surroundings?"

Oh... this had to be a joke!

\...or this Riddle really wasn't going to become Voldemort.

GAH!

"Of course, Professor," Riddle said with a small smile. "I'm always happy to help." She seemed to ponder something for a moment. "The prefects don't have our patrol schedules yet, but maybe I could take Harry out with me on patrol later in the week when we're both free and show him properly around the castle?" She bit her lip as if nervous. "I know prefects usually aren't supposed to take their friends out on rounds, and I know it might be asking for you to place quite a lot of trust in me, but---"

"Not at all, not at all," Slughorn said with a wave of his thick hand. "Why, I think it's a wonderful idea!" The Potions Master glanced towards Harry. "What say you, m'boy?" Harry nodded quickly, trying to look shy and nervous, which really wasn't hard after feeling those exact things for a number of hours. "Excellent, excellent!"

"I'd be happy to help with Runes and Arithmancy as well if needed," Emily offered.

Slughorn seemed to sag with relief. "It might be best," he agreed. "Runes in particular is quite a heavy subject. I was going to take on the task of helping Harry here catch up myself, but..."

"It's no trouble, sir," said Emily, still smiling. "I enjoy Runes and they say that once you can teach something, you have truly mastered it. I wouldn't mind finding out how close to mastering the subject I really am."

Slughorn laughed heartily. "I dare say you might just be there," he said through his chuckles. "Well, get your schedule, Emily, and then come and see me in my office. I'm sure we can work something out." Harry just sat there, transfixed and helpless to stop anything from transpiring.

Slughorn glanced back outside. "You two best be getting along. I would hate for either of you to be late. Especially you, my dear, being a prefect and all."

"I'll make sure to be on time, Professor," Riddle got to feet and indicated with a gesture that Harry should do the same. She beat him to the door and held it open, which he found rather odd, since he was pretty sure traditional customs were that he did just that for her.

It became obvious why she did it a brief moment later when she closed the door behind her, following him out into the corridor and reaching out, resting a firm hand on his shoulder.

He tensed, but Riddle seemed not to notice. "I don't imagine the caretaker will take well to the story of a transfer," Riddle said thoughtfully, beginning to guide him through the corridors, her grip on his shoulder still firm as ever. "He's a bit... touchy in his old age. It would be a shame for you to get falsely accused of faking your age or any such nonsense on your first day. I can help you with him if you'd like."

Harry knew at once it would be impolite to decline and he knew that he had to keep up decent relations with Riddle, at least for now. He wanted to keep Slughorn very firmly on his side and Riddle seemed to have indoctrinated herself to him long ago.

Not that she had spoken her last sentence as if it were a question. The words might have implied that, but the tone certainly did not.

Nor did her grip on his shoulder. It wasn't painful, but Merlin did she have a hold on him, and she still managed to look casual as she maneuvered both of them through the hall, which was swiftly beginning to fill with Hogwarts students waiting to exit the train after hours of being trapped in static monotony.

The two of them didn't have much time to talk before they came to another compartment with several students standing ready outside the door. Harry suddenly felt very wary and as if Riddle had led him into a trap. All of the gathered students were staring at him as if they were a pack of rabid predators.

Riddle's grip tightened on Harry's shoulder enough to make him briefly wince as she sent a hard look at each of the gathered members of what must have been her inner circle of friends. Or minions, depending on how closely this timeline likely followed his own.

They didn't stop glancing at Harry as Riddle, with a hand still on his shoulder, led him off the train, but their glares became much less predatory and much less frequent.

"Have you read up on the four houses?" she asked him. He nodded. "Any guesses as to where you'll land?"

\...holy hell, he hadn't even thought about that!

He had obviously been sorted into Gryffindor during his own time, but would that stay the same?

*\"You could be great, you know, it\'s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that...\"*

Harry shivered as the Sorting Hat's words came back to him in a rush.

Was it true? Would he have been great in Slytherin?

He shivered again.

Could he still be great in Slytherin?

Was he still a Gryffindor after the colossal shift in mentality he had gone through after staring brokenly into those lifeless, hollow eyes?

"I... don't know," he admitted.

Obviously, he sounded just as nervous and defeated as he felt, as Riddle gave his shoulder what must have been meant to be a reassuring squeeze. "All of the houses have their values."

She said it with such sincerity that Harry honestly wondered if it was true. The Voldemort of his time certainly hadn't believed that. Perhaps at this age, but even the Riddle in the Chamber hadn't struck him as being overly inclusive.

Riddle led him towards a tall, burly man with short, oily hair and tanned, wrinkled skin. The man's name was Apollyon Pringle and he was apparently the Caretaker at this time.

Merlin, even Filch hadn't been around yet. This really was going to be a strange year.

As much as he was sure personally escorting him had been a ploy of some kind, Harry was genuinely thankful that Riddle had done so. He hated it, but he was thankful for it. Pringle did seem rather skeptical of his transfer status. It took even Riddle --- a far more eloquent speaker than Harry would likely ever be --- a solid minute or two of explaining before the old man grudgingly accepted the claim and barked at Harry to follow him.

"Good luck," Riddle called, finally releasing her grip on him and allowing him to walk after the Caretaker.

It felt odd having her hand off of him. He felt as though he could still feel its weight and his skin seemed to tingle under his robe.

He took the same route across the Black Lake he had taken as a first year and was led up out of the same docking station and up to the castle's imposing front doors. Pringle knocked with much more impatience than Hagrid and when the door opened, Harry had to resist the urge to gape.

It wasn't stern Professor McGonagall in the doorway in her plain black robes, but an auburn-haired version of Professor Dumbledore, one who looked far younger, far less weathered, and who was resplendent in robes of sky blue trimmed in silver.

"The new batch," Pringle said shortly.

If Dumbledore was at all taken aback by his tone, he didn't show it. On the contrary, his eyes were gleaming like the stars far above them. "Why thank you, my dear man," Dumbledore said cheerfully. "Do come in and enjoy the warm hospitality of the castle while I get this lot filled in."

Pringle did just that and Dumbledore, smiling, led them to the rather familiar-looking antechamber off the main hall and gave them a rousing speech about the four Hogwarts houses. All the while, the constant drone of hundreds of voices could be heard from the hall beyond.

They were led into the hall itself minutes later and Harry did all he could not to smile too broadly as he felt truly at home for the first time since arriving back in the past.

The one major upside about being hurled back in time was that this was the shortest summer break he'd ever had. Short as it might have been, he had still very much missed everything about the castle. From its towering turrets to its high, imposing towers. He hadn't realized how much he had missed the small things currently dotted throughout the great hall; the ghosts shining misty silver, the enchanting glow of the goblets, reflecting the pale magical light shone down upon them from above. And Merlin, how the hall's enchanted ceiling never failed to take Harry's breath away.

Seeing this younger Dumbledore place the ancient Hogwarts Sorting Hat atop the spindle-legged stool as opposed to McGonagall was strange to say the least. Only when the Sorting Hat started singing did Harry suddenly realize he hadn't heard it since his first year. During his second, he and Ron had been busy flying an enchanted Ford Anglia into a particularly short-tempered tree. During his third, he had been busy being fussed over after the dementor-induced hell that had been the end of his journey to Hogwarts that September.

When the hat finished its song, Dumbledore uncoiled a comically long roll of parchment, cleared his throat softly, and began to call the first years forward, one by one.

Harry tuned out most of the sorting, for he was far too busy panicking.

Until Riddle had mentioned it on the way down to the castle, he had completely forgotten about the Sorting. It was just so natural for him to think of himself as a Gryffindor that he hadn't honestly given it a whole lot of thought. Now that he was doing just that, he was suddenly becoming less and less confident in himself being a Gryffindor.

He certainly still fit the house's traits. He was doubtlessly brave and he liked to think of himself as chivalrous, but that wasn't the question.

The question was whether or not they were still his *most* prevalent traits, at least when comparing them to those of the other three houses.

He certainly had been far more Ravenclaw-like as of late, spending great amounts of time in the Fawleys' library. His work ethic had been indicative of a Hufflepuff and he thought himself to be loyal, if admittedly to a very select few who earned his trust.

And Slytherin...

His goal during his own time had been to conquer Lord Voldemort. He had never consciously said it aloud, but it had always been there. Avenging his parents' murder and granting himself freedom in the process. He still thought that to be his goal, assuming Riddle did indeed turn out to be Voldemort, but if she didn't?

And cunning... was he cunning? Resourceful... well, his adventures would certainly indicate he was resourceful, but...

"Pavonis, Hadrian."

Oh... fuck!

Already?

Much earlier that day, Harry had reflected on how quickly things one tended to dread approached; this only validated the thought. He'd become so lost in thought he hadn't even registered the passing of time, nor the rapidly shortening line in front of him.

He hardly even felt his steps as he mechanically walked up towards the stool, trying not to shake and shiver along the way.

Dumbledore met his eyes for a fraction of a second before he took his seat and he thought he saw... something unfamiliar within them, but he was on the stool before he could recognize it, and the hat had been placed atop his head.

It was still comically large on him. He was quite small for his age --- not drastically so, yet noticeably --- but he was not nearly as undersized as he had been at the age of eleven. On that occasion, the hat had basically engulfed his entire face and head.

'My, my,' the hat whispered inside his mind, 'it seems the next half a century is set to be quite eventful, hm?'

Oh... that was not good.

Harry hadn't even considered the fact the hat could see his thoughts. He hadn't even considered it might glean the truth of how he had arrived.

Merlin, this was not---

'Calm yourself, Master Potter,' the hat said calmly. 'I cannot reveal your many secrets, and I wouldn't even if I could. Knowing the future is a dangerous thing in the best of times. Knowing the future of a slightly altered world that may or may not come to pass in this reality is still more dangerous.'

Harry felt his heart rate quicken. 'So,' he thought back, 'there's a chance things don't play out the same way?'

'A chance?' the hat asked with obvious amusement. 'Of course there is a chance. Our worlds are different and your inclusion in this one... well, it will certainly spark changes, no doubt about that. How large these changes are to be... only time shall tell. Is there a chance Albus Dumbledore might not best Gellert Grindelwald in this world? Perhaps. Is there a chance Lily Evans may never marry James Potter? Unlikely, unless you get too directly involved, but it's possible. Is there a chance Emily Riddle may never become the monster you saw in your own time? Certainly, with the right... alterations.'

'Alterations?' asked Harry.

'It's one word for it,' the hat mused. 'The word I have chosen to use, at the very least. We shall get to that in a moment. I feel there is something else I should inform you of, for I feel the nudge of something that may well be reality compelling me to do just that. It is very taxing to say no for too long.'

'What is it?'

'You are terribly worried that others who know Legilimency may look into your thoughts and glean your past, and what is possibly our future.' Harry gripped the edges of the stool very tightly as his anxiety mounted. 'You do not have to worry about this quite as intensely as you might think,' the hat said very carefully, obviously choosing its words with the utmost caution.

'This isn't to say that can't happen. It most certainly can, but not quite as easily as you might think.'

'What do you mean?' Harry asked tensely.

'Reality does not like being disturbed, as I'm sure you know very well, Harry Potter.' It almost felt odd hearing his real name after so long. 'Still, it doesn't just create things to keep itself safe. But if given something to twist... well, your mother's protection was quite successful in defending your body from those who tried to do it harm. I think you will find that the protection lingers. Since Miss Riddle has done nothing wrong to you at this time, it is not applied to her specifically, but more... broadly.'

'It stops people from reading my mind?'

'Oh, heavens no; not in the slightest.' The hat laughed and Harry tensed, but it began to speak again after a pause.

'People may read your thoughts at their leisure. What it does is make it very difficult to learn of your... travels. They can learn that your name is Harry Potter. They can learn that you lived with your muggle relatives and that you had a friend named Ronald. What they will incomprehensibly fail to do is put the pieces together and learn the whole truth.' The hat paused, seeming to seriously consider its own words. 'Well, I think they *could* figure it out, but only if you allowed a particularly skilled mind-walker unfettered access to your thoughts for a prolonged period.'

Harry took all of that in.

The protection of his mother's sacrifice had been warped if the hat was to be believed. It seemed less effective now than it was in his own time, but it seemed to apply to everyone and not just Voldemort.

'Equivalent exchange, Master Potter,' the hat said knowingly. 'Magic is all about equivalent exchange. Especially magic of the more... abstract variety. If you don't believe me, you might want to ask our new Alchemy professor.'

Harry didn't quite understand exactly why the hat sounded so amused, but he didn't have long to ponder, for his heart practically stopped beating when the hat spoke its next words.

'Now, I can see the masses are becoming impatient, so it's time to do what I was made to do. I am afraid this will not be quite as prolonged as the last time we discussed your sorting.' The hat seemed to pause and Harry's heart started beating again...

Very, very quickly, as he somehow knew what was about to happen right before it did, though it still sent a horrible jolt of shock coursing through his body.

'It is time for the alterations we spoke of that might shift some things around a bit.' Harry could practically feel the hat's smirk. 'And it would be quite boring for you if you just relived the same reality again, hm?' It paused once more. 'And I do not like being made a fool of.

'Fool me once --- shame on you! Fool me twice --- shame on me! I am afraid you won't quite trip me up this time, Hadrian Pavonis. Enjoy your stay in...'\

**Chapter 5: A Rude Reunion**

***September 1, 1942***

***The Great Hall at Hogwarts***

***9:33 PM***

Harry's legs felt like lead as he shakily rose from the stool, teetering where he stood as he looked out at the expansive Great Hall with wide, dumbstruck eyes. His catatonic reaction was ironic, as the hall had reacted with far less vigour than they did in his former reality. Whispers had followed him up to the stool then, and his sorting into Gryffindor House had been greeted with tumultuous applause that could have easily been mistaken for repeatedly booming claps of thunder.

Despite the crowd's not-so-notable reaction this time around, Harry felt utterly gobsmacked. He could not believe what had just happened.

The first time the Sorting Hat had tried to sort him into Slytherin, he hadn't thought too much on the matter. Except for the few weeks in his second year during which he was widely assumed to be the Heir of Slytherin, he had pushed the instance aside. He had been eleven and naive, and it was his initial introduction to the wizarding world. He'd known nothing at all, so surely he couldn't take the hat's subtle words into account.

This time, there was no ignoring the truth.

It was nearly three years later --- ignoring the whole time travel thing --- and Harry had *actually* been sorted into Slytherin.

He... didn't feel as horrified as he might have expected.

Everything about his own time told him that Slytherin House meant *bad news.* Draco Malfoy had been a Slytherin, as had his idiotic goons and moronic sycophants. There had never been a Slytherin who had treated Harry well, and the Slytherin Head of House had gone out of his way to make Harry's life a living hell during the three years Harry had spent under his rule.

All of that was true, but none of it could be applied to this reality thus far.

Elena was a Slytherin, and she was Harry's best friend. In little more than a month, she had become nearly as close with him as Ron and Hermione had been in his original world. There was no one currently alive he liked more than Elena, and the closest person to her was probably Slughorn. The man had his obvious flaws and Harry was sure there was a lot more to their relationship than he was privy to. Whether any of that was true or not, he treated Harry exceptionally well. The man had stuck his own neck out for Harry and had even faked documentation just to allow him to enter Hogwarts --- something he was more grateful for than he could ever quantify through words or thoughts.

And again, like Elena, Slughorn was a Slytherin. The Head of Slytherin House, even. The two people who were by far closest to him in this timeline were both Slytherins. Logically, he should be happy, right?

Or should he?

He had three years of hard conditioning that Slytherins were evil. Hell, Voldemort had even been a Slytherin...

Wait!

*Fuck!*

Riddle was almost definitely a Slytherin.

His eyes roamed towards the silver and green table as he mechanically walked across the hall, his footsteps echoing in his ears despite the polite applause permeating the room.

His gaze found her almost immediately.

She was seated in the dead-centre of the table, clapping along with the others, a polite smile plastered on her face. Her friends --- or whatever they were --- were clustered all around her. Something about the sight sent a shiver up Harry's spine. Or perhaps that was caused by the fact Riddle hadn't yet taken her eyes off of him for even a second. Harry couldn't make out the gleam in her eyes particularly well from this distance, with his vision slightly impeded by all that was between them, but he could tell it was there.

A part of him didn't want to accept being sorted into Slytherin. Not after what he had gone through during his own reality. Especially not after taking into account the massive killing machine Salazar had left looming under the school.

Riddle being in the house of snakes just made that option all the more tempting.

He still wasn't positive she would become Voldemort. Far from it, even. She just seemed... too innocent to be a Dark Lord? Or Dark Lady, he supposed. He wasn't sure that was the right way to think about it, but picturing her as the monster that was Voldemort was just something he found very difficult to do.

That didn't mean he wasn't going to be damn cautious around her.

His new philosophy on Riddle was that he was going to avoid her at all costs. If he was wrong and she did turn out to be Voldemort, he wanted nothing to do with her. Not until she became a problem, at least. At which point, he could only hope he would have the necessary tools to deal with her. Tools he had lacked in his own world, and tools that he would endeavour to acquire in this one.

Even if she didn't become Voldemort, there was unmistakably an air of danger around Emily Riddle. There was something about her that wasn't entirely natural. He hadn't gotten a similar feeling from anyone else he had ever met. She was also *way* too interested in him for his own liking.

*"Brilliant. Of course, he was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen."*

Those had been Dumbledore's words after Harry had returned from the Chamber of Secrets. He doubted that case would be any different here. The girl had already admitted to being very good at Runes and Slughorn seemed to practically worship her. It made sense she was likely just as brilliant as her male counterpart had been in Harry's own time. If that was the case, Harry had... problems.

The hat had mentioned that his secrets couldn't be gleaned from reading his mind. At least not without a great deal of effort. It hadn\'t mentioned anything about somebody figuring it out though. It seemed unlikely to him, but it probably wasn't impossible. Least of all from an actual genius and by all accounts, even with all the terrible things he had done, Voldemort was a genius. He was sure the same could be said for Emily Riddle, whether she would one day become a dark lady or not.

*"After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things --- terrible, yes, but great."*

Ollivander\'s words to Harry during his visit to the old man's shop before his first year at Hogwarts came to mind. If Riddle was as great as everyone --- even his enemies --- had been saying, then surely it wasn't out of the question that his female counterpart could deduce exactly what was going on? Probably not with any degree of swiftness or without the opportunity to do so, but she had seemed *very* interested in Harry.

Had he been sorted into Gryffindor, this wouldn't have been wholly problematic. Mildly troubling, yes, but not necessarily a problem. He assumed it would have been quite easy to avoid her.

Being sorted into Slytherin... with her as his prefect... not so much.

Especially considering both of those facts were going to give Slughorn all the excuses in the world to force them together. Harry might have been an idiot, at times, but even he hadn't been blind enough to miss what Slughorn had been trying to do. The man had mentioned an exclusive group to him over the summer and the meeting on the train had been just that. It was clear that among his favourite pupils, Riddle was his star student. She was the one he held in the highest regard. It was natural he would want Harry to get to know her if the man really did want what was best for Harry.

If only he knew what Riddle could become.

Gah!

This nonsensical wondering was complete and utter bullshit!

He was drawing near to the Slytherin table and Riddle was very obviously trying to catch his eye. He had no idea where he was going to sit, but next to her would not be his first choice. It would probably be his absolute last choice, all things considered.

A pair of green eyes off to Riddle's right caught Harry's attention and he practically sagged with relief when he realized Elena had saved him a seat. He offered her a grateful smile as he walked forward, sliding smoothly into the seat beside her.

"Thanks, Elena."

She smiled at him. "Don't mention it. Welcome to Slytherin."

"Happy to be here." He wondered whether or not she could detect any bit of hesitation in his voice. If she could, there was no comment made.

The sorting ceremony concluded in short order and vast amounts of food of every variety suddenly filled the tables. Piles of pasta, mounds of meat, and heaps of vegetables dominated the table, along with assortments of other things Harry had never tried --- even after his three years in the castle.

"You look tense," noted Elena without looking at him, delicately spooning potatoes onto her plate.

"It's... complicated."

She nodded. "I think everyone is a little bit tense on the first night. It's a lot to take in."

That was actually a really good excuse. Harry was going to roll with that.

"I've never heard the name Pavonis before." The voice came from a bit to Harry's right. It was cool and light, but even Harry could tell it was screaming with implications.

It belonged to a pale boy with very sharp features, dark eyes, and wild black hair. His entire look was a bit wild, actually. The girl sitting beside him looked a bit tamer, but they resembled each other very closely. The same eyes, the same coloured hair, the same shaped face. Harry thought they might have been twins, but it was hard to say.

"What's it to you?" he asked carefully.

"Depends on how you look at it, I guess. Names can be important things in this country. Some more than others."

"And some things are more important than names," Harry countered.

The boy dipped his head, a smirk playing on his lips. "I can't argue that, but you can't blame me for being curious, can you?" Harry wasn't really that curious about this boy, but he shook his head anyway. Best to not make too many enemies on the first night. Not when so many of the upper years seemed to already be hanging off of Riddle's every word. "I'm Carrow, by the way," the boy said, "Damien Carrow. This is my sister, Victoria, heiress of the Ancient House of Carrow."

Harry dipped his head in polite acknowledgement of her title. "Nice to meet you both. I'm Harry. Harry Pavonis."

Damien raised his eyebrows. "Harry, huh? I thought it was Hadrian."

Merlin, if somebody else called him Hadrian tonight, he was probably going to punch them in the face. "Technically, yes, but it's way too garish. I'd really just prefer it if you called me Harry."

"If you'd like," the male Carrow agreed.

"Are you a transfer student?" It was a different girl who asked this question. She was sitting just off to his left and had blonde hair with soft, angelic features.

He nodded. "I went to Ilvermorny in America. My parents were British but did a lot of travelling. We moved back to Europe and they died in a raid."

She winced. "I'm sorry to hear that."

"Thank you." It was as insincere as every other fake 'thank you' Harry had given to similar comments about the way his actual parents had died, but the girl seemed not to notice, or not to care.

"Were they... the right sort?" asked Damien Carrow.

Harry had to put a great deal of effort into the internal battle he was having to fight to not roll his eyes so hard they might have fallen out of his head.

Welcome to Slytherin, and here's the blood purist nonsense that Draco Malfoy had flaunted every second of the day as he had traipsed about the castle as if he was some sort of prince confidently stalking across his land.

"They were both halfbloods," Harry said, his posture a bit stiffer than usual.

Carrow nodded curtly and turned away. The answer was clearly acceptable and he could find no real fault in it, but it wasn't exactly what he had been hoping to hear.

Harry immediately pegged him as a complete and utter twat.

The food vanished sometime later, only to be replaced by towering masses of every sort of dessert one could ever imagine. There were enough sweet sauces, dips, and the like for a battalion to drown in, and the amount of food was so copious that Harry could only wonder what was done with the leftovers.

He was already suitably stuffed by this point, having eaten a bit in Slughorn's compartment as well as now, but he managed to force down a bit of treacle tart before the desserts vanished too. A very weathered-looking old man rose from the golden, high-backed throne of a chair that Harry was so used to seeing occupied by Dumbledore.

This man was shorter than the current professor of Transfiguration and he looked feebler than Dumbledore ever had, even fifty years from now. His build could, at best, be described as frail, and the slight amounts of wispy, white hair he had were sparse at most. The man's brown eyes still shone with a shocking amount of intelligence that none in the room could miss. Harry also found it amusing that in spite of the man's age, he spoke nowhere near as whimsically as he remembered Dumbledore speaking in his own time.

"Good evening, everyone. I hope the summer treated you all much better than it treated me. Of course, the passing of time treats me much poorer than it does all of you, but we move on.

"A few simple rules. No magic is to be performed in the corridors and the forest on the edge of the grounds is forbidden to all students. There are all sorts of nasty things in there and there will be no exceptions.

"Quidditch tryouts will take place in the second week of term. See your heads of house for details about that.

"Finally, Hogwarts has the pleasure of welcoming a very esteemed new member of our staff. Some years ago, alchemy was taught by our very own Professor Dumbledore, who now, of course, teaches Transfiguration. Until now, I have been unable to find a suitable replacement, but I think I have finally managed. I would like you all to meet Professor Reginald Gress. He comes to us from America, where he is a very decorated alchemist and has numerous achievements to his name."

Harry audibly groaned as Reginald Edward Gress took to his feet and bowed rigidly. It very much looked as though he was a man trying to act far more graceful than he really was. Harry could picture him practicing for hours in front of a mirror but just not being able to get it right. He was also still wearing the white lab coat he was bedecked in when the two of them, plus Elena, had met in Diagon Alley. That probably wasn't helping his mobility any.

"Not this lunatic," he muttered into his hands, which he had quickly risen to cover his face as he cast his horrified gaze anywhere but up at the staff table. He had never been so grateful that alchemy was a course offered only to N.E.W.T students continuing in both Potions and Transfiguration.

"He fixed your eyes," Elena pointed out, though she sounded rather meek. She was unmistakably just as horrified by this anomaly of a man as Harry; she was simply more polite about it.

"And with that," came Dippet's voice, prompting Harry to look back up towards the staff table, "I bid you all a good night. Off you go."

The sound of scraping benches dominated the hall as everyone slowly and dazedly stood, weighed down by the generous meals resting heavily inside their stomachs.

"I've never been so full in my life," groaned Elena as the two of them made to leave the hall. Harry nodded, not at all disagreeing with the sentiment. Elena only scowled in return. "You don't have any reason to complain! You barely ate anything compared to me!"

"Not true. I ate in Slughorn's carriage earlier."

"Oh." Elena suddenly appeared less energetic. Harry remembered all of a sudden that Elena had been left off Slughorn's list of invites, even though she had apparently been at the very same meeting the year before. The revelation was very awkward, but Elena seemed to stiffen before he could say anything.

"Come on!" she whispered, urging Harry forward as the two of them suddenly began rushing from the hall. Harry was confused until he briefly glanced back over his shoulder.

Riddle and the other fifth-year prefect --- Rosier, if Harry remembered correctly from their introduction on the train --- had stood and they were shepherding the new first years towards them. More accurately, Rosier was doing that whilst Riddle's eyes were focused on Harry. He instinctively knew she was going to suggest he come with them since he was, in essence, a first year.

His stride lengthened and his cadence quickened. Before he knew it, he and Elena were out of the Great Hall and he was breathing a slight sigh of relief.

"She didn't... do anything to you today, did she?" Harry had never heard Elena sound so... tentative.

Well, he had, once. In Diagon Alley, minutes after their interaction with Riddle in Madam Malkin's.

It was unnerving.

"She hasn't done anything to me. She's been perfectly polite. There's just... something about her." It was the understatement of the century, but he was hardly going to explain his real reasons for avoiding Riddle at all costs.

Elena nodded and said no more on the subject as they made the oddly familiar trek down to the dungeons. Harry knew where the Slytherin common room was already. He even knew what it looked like, for he had been inside it once. That had been during his second year when he and Ron had snuck in while polyjuiced to look like Crabbe and Goyle.

The thought of Ron sent what was, by now, a familiar jolt through his abdomen and into his chest, but it felt duller now than it had been. At first, it had been jarring in a way that was impossible to describe and the mere thought of either of his old friends had left him shaking. It was still unpleasant, but less so. It felt almost as though the pain was numbed by medication, or like the early jolts had been him being struck by bolts of lightning, and these were merely him sticking his finger into an electrical socket. Still far from pleasant, but positively mundane by comparison.

"The common room is password protected," Elena was saying.

Harry frowned. "Do you know what the password is?"

She nodded. "It was in my Hogwarts letter."

Harry's frown deepened. That was far more organized than when he had attended Hogwarts fifty years from now.

Merlin... was that paradox ever going to become less confusing?

Soon, they came to a stretch of the wall that looked much like the rest. Except for when Elena spoke the password --- sanctuary --- it slid aside like a muggle sliding door, with no indication it had been there at all but the lingering sound of grinding stone.

They stepped from the dimly-lit dungeon corridor, with its low, flickering torches into the common room, which was perhaps even dimmer at this time of night. Torches were sparse in this place. They actually seemed non-existent. Magically spherical lights floated helter-skelter about the room, glowing an odd, green colour. The black lake cast a viridescent glow over the room that made it feel more sinister, though that light was extremely dim at this time of night. Harry wondered how there was light from the outside water at all. Perhaps some sort of magic, but it seemed excessive and unnatural.

Then again, that also sounded exactly right, for wizards were nothing if not excessive and unnatural.

"Come on," said Elena, "I'll show you where the dorms are. There are gender wards, so I can't take you to yours, but I'm sure you can find it."

They hadn't beaten the prefects by much. The entrance opened once more before the two of them could cross the common room. Their paths had been impeded by a surprisingly large number of people, all of whom seemed to be conversing. Some were doing so formally, others were simply doing things as mundane as retelling the events of the summer.

Quick footsteps could be heard from behind them before they could make it across the room and Harry realized somebody was drawing near. He turned around and had to resist the urge to reach for his wand, one that only grew when he saw exactly who it was bearing down upon him.

A group of upper years walked between Harry and Riddle and he almost breathed a sigh of relief. She was standing directly under one of the magical spheres. It made her skin look ghostly and caused her eyes to shine with a hellish sort of light. They were like bluebell flames, but so much darker.

Harry wondered whether she would make a scene, but she didn't. Whatever she had meant to say had been ruined by the unintentional intervention of others, though Harry could feel her stare burning a hole straight through him as he sloped down a tunnel off the main common room and into the place where the dorms were set.

He had survived the first night, it seemed. Now, he only had to repeat that feat for every day that passed in the next ten months.

***September 2, 1942***

***The Great Hall***

***8:31 AM***

Harry and Elena once more sat together that next morning at breakfast, with those from their year clustered all around them. Both of them stayed quiet, occasionally exchanging bits of casual conversation, but not often. They were content to sit in silence and let the others babble on. Particularly Harry, who wasn't entirely sure who or what he was dealing with as of yet.

Timetables were distributed about halfway through breakfast and Harry realized at once that he was not in for an easy first day.

"Doubles in Charms and Runes? I always hate two doubles in a day, and Runes is a bit of a hefty course."

"Can't say I'm looking forward to that," Harry admitted. Runes wasn't actually taught at Ilvermorny, so he at least had a cover for what he viewed as his inevitable ineptitude in the subject.

"You'll be fine," said Elena. "I'm sure the professor will work with you. He's a brutally difficult marker, but he's always happy to answer questions and whatnot."

Harry snorted. "Something tells me I'm going to have a lot of questions."

By Merlin, did he hope that assessment was wrong. If he had a ton of questions, that would mean that he might actually get paired with Riddle for tutoring, which was something he wanted to avoid as a whole.

Speaking of the devil, Riddle entered the hall alone, strolling confidently towards her group of friends gathered at the Slytherin table...

Until she veered slightly off course and took the seat directly across from Harry.

All around them, the conversation fell silent.

"Good morning," she greeted, buttering a piece of toast with well-practiced precision as she smiled at them. If she wasn't a morning person, she hid it excellently. Her appearance was as pristine as ever and she looked just as alert as any other time Harry had seen her.

"Morning," he answered carefully, realizing Elena wasn't going to say anything --- no matter how long he allowed the silence to stretch on.

"What does your first day look like?" Riddle asked, looking up from her toast to appraise him.

Her face was the perfect mask of polite curiosity. It almost seemed too innocent. Harry felt as though she was concealing something, but he couldn't for the life of him think what that might be. Nor could he work out why Riddle seemed at all interested in him. She seemed much too transfixed, actually. If he'd had a newbie practically dumped on them by a professor, he would have been mildly annoyed, but Riddle seemed genuinely intrigued by him.

He supposed a transfer student was rare since there had been none in his time, nor did he know of any in this reality. Not that such things meant a whole lot, as he knew very little about anyone in the castle --- except Elena and Slughorn. Riddle's curiosity still seemed a bit too intense to be natural. Harry felt that he was either looking way too far into Riddle just being an *extremely* responsible prefect and a genuinely good person, or he was missing something crucial.

He saw nothing to do but answer her question. "Charms double in the morning and double Runes in the afternoon."

"I believe Runes was a subject Professor Slughorn said you might be a bit behind in?" Harry nodded reluctantly. "If you have any troubles, come and find me in the common room tonight. If you're not comfortable with that, that's also fine. I'll make sure to check in with Professor Anderson when I have my first lesson of the year in the subject tomorrow." She stood from her chair. "Best of luck on your first day, Harry. You as well, Elena."

***That afternoon, in the Ancient Runes classroom...***

The Charms lesson that morning had passed without drama. It had primarily been a review of the third-year material. Charms wasn't Harry's best subject, but he was comfortable in it. He had spent some time working on the subject over the summer. It was only natural as Charms was a fairly large component in duelling; which was what a great deal of his time had been dedicated to.

He and Elena had been among the best performers in their year from what he could tell. Neither of them had been the best, but they had been good.

It was pretty clear that the best in Charms for their year --- at least within Slytherin --- had been a girl Harry learned through the attendance was named Dorea Black. She was one of the people Harry had seen on the train ride to Hogwarts while in Slughorn's compartment. She was one of the people he had seen in Hagrid's photo album, as well as the Mirror of Erised in his first year, too.

It was odd to see her in person and it sent a sort of tingle up his spine. Elena had noticed something was off with him as he watched her cast, but she hadn't pressed him. She had just asked if he was all right and moved on when he assured her he was. He was positive she wasn't at all fooled, but she was too polite to force him to speak. That or, over the past month, she had learned that pressing him on such things was utterly pointless. Likely, it was a combination of both of those things that made her not pursue the point. Harry was grateful for it, whatever it was.

Dorea Black had been significantly far ahead of himself and Elena. Along with Harlow Yaxley --- the angelic blonde girl from the night before --- the four made up the best of their class.

They hadn't had any classes between Charms and Runes, which they had just entered. Harry was very nervous for this class, and his nerves only grew until the bell rang and the professor looked up from the obscenely large stack of papers on his desk and stood to his feet.

He was a short but well-built man with black hair. He looked to be middle-aged, and his eyes seemed to devour the room as he looked around at all of them.

"Welcome back to Ancient Runes," he said. "Or, in the case of Master Pavonis, welcome to Ancient Runes. Today isn't going to be overly difficult and it isn't going to be overly interesting, either. Today, I want to see how much you retained from what we learned last year.

"For those who don't remember or just need a refresher, last year was spent learning a few of the basic runic languages. We started with Elder Futhark, and then we branched into Ancient Greek and Norse, as well as some South American based languages that have since fallen out of favour.

"This year, we'll be spending more time actually working with runes. Now that the foundations are laid out, it is my goal to teach you all to begin applying runes in basic projects. The end-of-year project will be heavy in application this year, so everything will be geared towards that. Next year, the projects will get more advanced as we prepare you for your O.W.L exams.

"But first, today... and the review." He withdrew a wand from his sleeve and gave it a lazy flick. A drawer of his desk opened and for even more parchment to float out of it. Each stack of sheets landed in front of a student and Harry felt his heart rate quicken once more. "You'll have half the class to complete this review," said the professor. "I'll then spend a few minutes marking them, then we'll go over them together. Your time starts now."

Harry realized he was in trouble four questions in.

He had spent a small bit of time looking into Ancient Runes over the summer, but not nearly as much as he really should have. After the way his third year had ended, his mind had been far more focused on learning magic that would directly help him avoid or escape situations like that in the future. He had made great strides in that sort of magic, but he realized right away that he was terribly far behind in Runes. He barely knew any Elder Futhark or Ancient Greek, let alone Norse, Mayan, or any of the other languages they had been tested on.

Harry didn't need to receive his test results to know he had failed, but the grade did make his heart fall even further into the pit of his stomach. His throat felt oddly constricted as he practically choked on his dread and embarrassment.

As Professor Anderson began going over the test that now sat in front of him, Harry could only think one thought with mounting horror.

If he wanted to pass the class, he might actually have no other choice but to take any help Slughorn offered, even if that meant interacting more with Emily Riddle.

**Don't expect the next update to come as quickly as this chapter came out. I did promise more of this though, so chapter 6 will almost definitely be publicly available by the end of the month. The pace will soon speed up, though the chapters may shorten a bit, so I do want to get more of this posted.**

**There is one thing I feel the need to clear up because a lot of people have completely missed the point:**

**In regards to people complaining about the name Pavonis, their primary issue seems to be that it translates to peacock in Latin. I guess I may not technically have said this so bluntly in story, but I basically beat the readers over the head with the reason Harry chose that name and it has NOTHING to do with Latin.**

**Pavonis is a constellation in the night sky known for its vibrancy and brightness. The bit about constellations is Harry paying homage to Sirius and his family and the choice of constellation has to do with how bright it shines. It has nothing to do with Latin whatsoever. I'm kind of confused why people chose to extrapolate that when the justification is written near the end of chapter 2, but that is the actual reason. The translation is completely irrelevant.**

***September 3, 1942***

***The Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom***

***10:44 AM***

Harry's mind was reeling by the time he entered the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom the morning after his first lessons in both Charms and Ancient Runes. It wasn't actually that his mind was active out of any sense of anticipation for what was undoubtedly his favourite class. Rather, it was the fact that his mind had been left churning with the force of a vengeful sea after the lesson he had just sat through.

It had very little to do with the lesson itself, but more to do with its intrinsic oddities --- as well as what had followed it.

***Earlier that morning, in the Transfiguration classroom...***

It felt intensely odd for Harry to walk into the Transfiguration classroom and see anyone but Professor McGonagall awaiting him. It was even more jarring to see Professor Dumbledore in a setting like this. He had become accustomed to only seeing the serene man in the settings of his ornate, eccentric office --- or lounging behind the staff table in his grand, throne-like chair.

But, of course, this wasn't actually a serene, or even a particularly old-looking Dumbledore.

He didn't necessarily appear young, but old would have been a harsh description. He was still thin, but less so than he would be years later. He didn't quite look athletic, but he was far closer to that sort of build than Harry was accustomed to. His face had far fewer wrinkles, though his eyes still had the air of having seen a great many things. The most jarring change was his hair; both that atop his head as well as his beard. The latter was not quite as long as in Harry's time and they were both auburn, which was very different from the shining silver Harry was used to seeing.

"Welcome back," Dumbledore was saying, beaming at them in a manner Harry associated with his future self's ramblings at each welcoming feast. Even his voice sounded a touch stronger. "I hope you all enjoyed your summer as much as I did mine. I found some wonderful confections over the break that brightened my mood. I hope you all found something equally enjoyable."

Many of the Slytherins rolled their eyes or sighed exasperatedly, but none of them took their attention off of Dumbledore. Even if he was a bit whimsical, not even the antithesis to his beloved house of the brave could argue the man wasn't a brilliant teacher.

"Now, allow us to begin, shall we?" A general rumble of assent spread throughout the room. "I am going to assume, perhaps naively, that you all have no difficulty remembering last year's material. That is what the summer reading is for, after all; to ensure your brains do not become too rusty and unused over those months. Fourth-year Transfiguration will be more difficult than anything you have dealt with so far. I will, of course, be working you up to that level of difficulty, and will not simply throw you to the metaphorical wolves.

"By the end of this year, it is expected that you will all have gained competence and proficiency with not only the Switching Spell, but also other spells of a similar variety. This is also the year where you will begin experimenting with cross-species transformations. The difficulty of this depends on what you're working with, but for the scope of this class, it will be relatively simple.

"This year will begin with a large amount of time spent on the latter exploits before the former is explored a bit later. It is known to be the more difficult of the two, so I think it only best if we work our way up.

"Now, I do think it best if we start with something resembling a review. Worry not, for it shan't be too monotonous, I don't think."

His eyes were twinkling in the familiar way Harry had come to know and it was almost painful for him to see and know that, in this world, those eyes did not belong to the man Harry had admired for so long. Not the exact same man, anyway.

"Today, you will all be presented with the admirable challenge of turning hedgehogs into pincushions. It hopefully isn't the most difficult thing you have ever accomplished, but it is something I will not be giving instructions for, beyond the incantation and wand movement. It will be up to you and your own ingenuity. Think of it as a test. A test to see exactly how much you have learned over your past three years here beyond silly words and whimsical wand-waving."

Harry had struggled some with the day's task, though he had actually done better than most. He found that without distractions --- Ron grumbling alongside him, and Hermione unintentionally overloading his brain with 'help' for the duration of the class --- he was actually quite successful compared to his peers.

Not to say he completed the task.

What had once been his hedgehog resembled a pincushion far more than its original state by the time the bell rang to signify the end of class, but that did not at all mean he had succeeded. Dorea Black had performed about as well as he had; perhaps edging him out just slightly at the end of the class. Outside of that, it seemed as though he had done the best. They would apparently spend the first half of their first double period in the class next week finishing the task before moving onto their first bit of new material.

"Master Pavonis," called Dumbledore as most of the students present made hasty beelines for the door. "I would be ever so grateful if you could join me alone for a moment. I will, of course, provide you with a note excusing any tardiness I may unintentionally be responsible for."

Harry beckoned for Elena to go ahead to Defence whilst he waited for the room to clear and then made his way before Dumbledore.

Merlin, this felt so wrong...

Standing before Dumbledore not in the Headmaster's office, but in a normal classroom. Looking at him not across an immaculate desk, but an ordinary, unremarkable one.

Everything about it just felt so off.

"I am told you were educated at Ilvermorny?"

"Yes, sir," Harry responded, answering more so on reflex than anything else.

"Hmm, most curious."

Harry frowned. "How so, Professor?"

"Well, Ilvermorny --- whilst a remarkable institution without doubt --- is not known for its Transfiguration program. It is the school's weakest subject, if one puts stock in academic records. No, where the American curriculum truly shines is in Charms. From what Horace has said about your prowess in defensive magic, I thought you might favour that branch of magic. I have been told by your Charms professor that you did well but not outstandingly so in his class. I, on the other hand, find myself quite impressed by your performance. Miss Black is the best Transfiguration student in your year, and yet you kept pace with her just fine. It is true she is not nearly as gifted in the subject as her older brother, Arcturus, and that she has a greater penchant for charms, but the Blacks have always had an odd affinity for transfiguration. I find it most interesting that you could keep pace with her despite your lack of high-level teaching in the subject."

Harry really did forget just how brilliant Dumbledore was at times.

Bugger!

Had he already been found out or exposed? Did Dumbledore already suspect something fishy about the backstory Slughorn had concocted for him? Was he really going to need to put extra time into Charms?

Well, he knew the answer to that last one. He wanted to get better at the subject already; if Dumbledore had noticed the trend, who was to say others wouldn't.

One student in particular poking holes in his cover story scared him more than he would ever care to admit, and if she was at all like her male counterpart in his time, ammunition was the last thing she needed.

"What are you saying, sir?"

"I am saying you have an admirable talent for my art." Harry could have sighed in relief. Dumbledore didn't think he was a liar; just naturally talented. "Your affinity is clearly impressive. I did notice that you seemed to struggle with some of the more subtle facets of Transfiguration."

Harry clearly looked puzzled because Dumbledore's lips twitched with obvious amusement before he elaborated upon his previous claim.

"I am speaking particularly of the visualization aspects of my class, Master Pavonis. You see, there are many ways to transfigure objects. Some ways work best for some than others. In my many travels, I have not found a single method that works best for everyone. What I saw today was obvious talent, but you failed to make any real changes to the more detailed components of the transfiguration. In my humble yet professional opinion, this indicates a flawed approach in regards to visualization." Dumbledore paused to think for a moment. "What is it that you are imagining when going about your transfigurations?"

Harry blinked. He was imagining exactly what Professor McGonagall had always told him to imagine.

"The finished transfiguration, sir."

Dumbledore frowned. "That is the most common approach, yes. Many instructors all over the world are even beginning to make it a standard practice. I fear that, in time, it may become more and more standardized. This has its benefits, of course. It is likely to produce a much higher percentage of competent users of the art, but few true masters, I am afraid. Least of all when some will struggle with such a uniform approach.

"But I digress. My advice to you is to not imagine the finished product at all."

"What should I imagine then, sir?"

"You are asking the right questions, though to answer it is more difficult. I could give you examples, but I think it best if you find out for yourself. Try a number of things while practicing simple transfigurations and reading up on the one I have assigned. Experimentation will be your best option. I could give you examples, but self-discovery is something I think valuable. It is my honest belief that by discovering one's optimal method themself, they best attune themself to that method and will therefore get the most out of it in the end." His eyes were twinkling like mad now. "Take this as a chance to prove my hypothesis. If you are struggling with this and it is taking too much time out of your studies, do come to me and I will guide you through it more directly."

***Back in the present...***

Seeing Dumbledore this way had been an experience, but Harry's mind was as fixated on his advice pertaining to Transfiguration as it was about him. Could it be possible that he had been performing transfigurations in a way that was less than ideal for him? Could it be that one simple --- or potentially not so simple --- change could drastically alter his ability in the subject? It seemed too easy, but Dumbledore had mentioned that he might struggle. It was just such an odd thought, especially considering Professor McGonagall had notoriously been one of the best teachers the Hogwarts of his time had to offer.

Perhaps Dumbledore was correct, as he had often been decades in the future. Perhaps more diverse ways of teaching really had just been phased out as time stretched on. If that was the case, Harry supposed he really shouldn't blame Professor McGonagall so much as the magical world at large. It was just one of so many illogical things about this mystical world of magic. A stark reminder that for all of its attractions --- and despite how superior Harry thought it was to the muggle world --- it was not without its own crippling problems.

He entered the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom a few minutes late, but class hadn't truly begun. Professor Merrythought, an older woman with shortish brown hair that was beginning to grey, had been taking the attendance.

"Ah, so you're the transfer," she said when Harry walked through the door.

He shuffled uncomfortably under her stare. "Yes, ma'am."

"Do you have a reason for being late?"

"I have a note from Professor Dumbledore."

Her eyebrows knit together. "Give it here, then." Harry marched to the front of the class and handed it over. The professor's dark brown eyes swept over the note quickly and intently. "Very well then," she said. "Go and take one of the available seats. Do try to ask Professor Dumbledore to wait for a better time in the future. I understand it was by his request, but I do not permit students to show up late to my class."

"Yes. Sorry, ma'am."

Harry took a seat beside Elena. She shot him a sympathetic look before Merrythought reached Harry's name on the register.

"Pavonis," she called.

"Present," Harry responded, and she nodded curtly before continuing down the list. Her mouth was set in a firm line that would have made Professor McGonagall blush; Harry could tell she was not at all fond of him.

When she completed the register, she tucked it away, cleared her throat, and addressed the class at large.

"Welcome back to Hogwarts and Defence Against the Dark Arts. I'm not going to waste any time. You are not eleven-year-old children, and you know what is expected of you --- whether you have been in my class before or not." Harry felt a trace of pink rise in his cheeks, but he tried to ignore it and kept looking straight forward.

"This first day is going to be more of a review period than anything else, but we won't waste it with you slaving away over textbooks. It's practical experience that will make or break a witch or wizard when defending yourself. Memorizing as many spells as Merlin created might make you feel all smug and superior, but doing so is of little use in the field of battle. What will keep you safe is knowing how to use and apply those spells, and that is what I want to make sure you all haven't lost the ability to do over the summer.

"Who can tell me what the main focus of the third-year Defence Against the Dark Arts curriculum was?" Elena's hand shot into the air, and it was her who the professor indicated.

"To learn how to defend yourself against common magical creatures that we might encounter in the future."

"Correct, take three points for Slytherin. Yes, we covered a number of creatures last year, but defending against most of them is laughably simple so long as you aren't completely inept. Luckily, none of you --- at least the ones I've taught --- fall into that unfortunate group of individuals.

"I say most creatures because several of you struggled with one particular creature." Harry couldn't help but notice how several students all around the room shuddered at that. If the curriculum in 1942 was anything like what it was in his own time, he had a sneaking suspicion he knew which creature Professor Merrythought was referring to. "That is the creature we will be reviewing today. I managed to acquire one, so we will be having a practical lesson. Everyone, to your feet with your wands out; form a single-file line. You will combat the boggart one after the other."

So it *was* the boggart...

Merlin, this was not going to be at all fun. Fighting the dementor had never been easy for Harry. How could it be, with the sounds of his parents' dying voices echoing inside his skull? He wondered if that might even be worse now that he had heard them in person; spoken to them, even.

That raised a thought that was altogether even more terrifying.

Would his boggart even be a dementor anymore?

He thought it would, at least in some shape, but he was slightly worried it might take a more complex form. If that was even possible, he supposed. He hadn't seen a boggart take on a particularly complex form before, but he didn't see why it wouldn't be capable of it if sufficiently motivated.

"Pavonis!" barked Merrythought. "Back of the line. I'm not sure whether or not you've dealt with boggarts before, so it's best you watch the others go to get an idea of exactly what it is you're going to have to do."

This woman was *really* starting to get on Harry's nerves.

There was just something about her. Her immediate dislike and casual dismissance of him... it reminded him far too strongly of Snape. That was a bastard who he was all too happy to escape. It was one of the very few things he was happy for when being thrown fifty years back in time. If he had to deal with someone like that again... Merlin, give him patience.

"Have you dealt with a boggart before?" asked Elena. Harry nodded curtly and she opened her mouth to respond, but Merrythought was calling her name before she could.

"Fawley! To the front. Lead us off with a strong performance."

Elena stepped forward with visible reluctance. Harry couldn't help but notice the way her legs shook on the way to the front of the class.

The professor had waved her wand and floated an old, battered-looking cabinet in front of Elena, inside of which was obviously the boggart they would all be tackling.

"You remember the spell and theory?" asked Merrythought. When Elena nodded, Merrythought turned to the cabinet, stepped out of the way, and waved her wand.

The cabinet's door practically rocketed open and out of it lunged a massive serpent with venom dripping from its fangs, which were bared and ready to strike as it neared ever closer to Elena's chest...

"Riddikulus!"

*CRACK!*

The snake's muscle-bound form quickly broke down and elongated until it was nothing but a loose line of string draped around Elena's finger, so close it had come to actually making contact with her.

That was an interesting thought, actually. Could a boggart really cause physical damage to a person? Harry had never seen one do so before, but he supposed there was no reason it wasn't possible.

Elena sent the string to the floor as she stepped back, allowing the next person --- Damien Carrow --- to step forward.

"You okay?" Harry asked when Elena chose to stand beside him whilst he waited for his own duel with the boggart.

She nodded. "I'm fine; I just don't like snakes. That's all."

"You did well." It was a weak sentiment, but it was all Harry could offer. His palms were sweating, his knees were shaking, and his heart was racing.

Elena smiled. "I'm sure you'll do just as well."

The line thinned out in front of him faster than Harry would have liked. Nobody had thus far failed to banish the boggart and he was still stuck making plans. How would one make a dementor look comical? And what if it wasn't even a dementor? Harry actually thought the latter prospect was a distinct possibility, so it was one that needed at least a degree of consideration.

"Pavonis!" barked Merrythought. "You're up!"

Harry stepped forward with a stony expression and a grip so tight on his wand that his fingers were numb. He hoped above all things he wouldn't see Hermione, nor Sirius, but he didn't want to see a dementor either...

He saw the latter, just as it had always been, rising from the floor, draped in its impenetrable cloak of darkness, and taking long, gasping breaths. With every intake of that horrid breath, it seemed to pull not just air into its maw but all light and happiness that existed in this suddenly dark and desolate place.

Many around the room had begun shaking and Harry could even hear the sounds of at least one person behind him collapsing, but his attention was frozen on the dementor before him as it glided ever so slowly forward.

He had nothing.

He had no idea how one was supposed to make a dementor look comical and by now, he had spent far too much time thinking. His brain practically viewed the thing as a dementor now; he could hear his mother's pleading screams echoing agonizingly through his mind, taunting him now more than ever that he had seen her in person.

He needed to stop it; he needed to defend himself, and he knew but one defence against such pure, unadulterated evil.

"EXPECTO PATRONUM!"

He thought about all that had been good in his past reality as he spoke the words, mixed with all that was good about this new one and, above all else, the overwhelming warmth and certainty he had felt when his patronus had driven off the hordes of dementors before the horrible truth of the moment had made itself known.

A halo of silver light burst forth from the tip of Harry's wand, surging towards the dementor as a singular mass before, about halfway, it contorted and coalesced into the brilliant shape of the stag which Harry had come to associate with his father.

The stag reared up and drove its front legs into the dementor's chest, sending it staggering back. Only now that the oppressive weight of the dementor's power had been lifted did Harry know exactly what he was fighting and he could think of just one thing that could make a dementor less terrifying.

"Riddikulus!"

*CRACK!*

There was a blinding flash of blue light so bright that the only thing that had been discernible through the light had been the still shining form of Harry's stag patronus. When the light cleared, the dementor's cloak was ablaze and it was rolling feebly on the floor for a moment before, with a great wail, the thing burst into black, acrid smoke and was gone.

The silence in the classroom was so absolute it may as well have been deafening. Harry's patronus looked around with wide, innocent eyes before traipsing over towards its master and peering up at him expectantly. Harry smiled down at it with genuine gratitude before he banished the creature with a flick of his wand; granting it the release it had so desperately wanted in the process.

Harry then took the time to look around for the first time since the boggart had appeared. He quickly came to the sharp and sudden realization that every single person in the room --- including the professor --- was staring at him with a look akin to that of a deer caught in the bright headlights of an oncoming semi-truck.

"Pavonis," Merrythought asked slowly. "Are you aware that the Patronus Charm is magic far beyond N.E.W.T. level?"

"No, ma'am." Harry knew it was very advanced, but he honestly hadn't known it was *that* advanced.

Merrythought's eyes narrowed. "Are you aware then, Pavonis, that not even aurors are mandated to know the Patronus Charm to serve? Largely due to its notorious difficulty?"

"No, ma'am."

"Well then, perhaps you could tell me how you learned of this charm and when you first achieved it?"

"I... had a professor teach it to me at Ilvermorny. They're noted for their charms and I had read about it in one of the school's books. He was a friend of my father's, so he agreed. I think the first time I cast it perfectly was last spring."

Deafening silence followed that proclamation.

"Twenty-five points to Slytherin," Merrythought said slowly and deliberately. "For a magical feat the likes of which I have never seen at this institution. Why, I wonder if even Emily..." her voice trailed off. "Continue to study, Pavonis. My door is always open for any of your questions or concerns."

"Yes, ma'am."

As Harry made his way back towards a shocked-looking Elena, he came to what was undoubtedly the most bitter revelation he'd come to since arriving fifty years in the past.

He had not escaped the undivided attention of the school after all. Apparently, he didn't need to be the Boy-Who-Lived to set off what he knew to be a publicity bomb.

***That night, in the Great Hall...***

Emily could tell something was different the moment she strolled into the Great Hall. There was chatter sweeping through the hall like a whispering wind, and certain pockets of the Slytherin table were animated to the point that Emily knew at once it was one of them who had sparked all of this disarray.

She focused her attention on those who she had cultivated and reached out with her Legilimency senses. It didn't take her long to ascertain the most affected parties of her group.

Some of her friends --- fourth years Blake Selwyn and Derrick Avery --- were waiting for her at the centre of the table where she and her friends always sat. It was clear to her almost at once that the two of them were agitated in one way or another.

"How was everyone's day?" Emily asked when they all had settled in. Many of them murmured general comments, but she couldn't help but believe, once more, the two fourth years had more to say. "Is something on your mind, Avery?" He was the less confident and more loyal of the two of them and of the pair, he was far less subtle.

"We... had an interesting lesson with Merrythought."

"Oh?"

"We went over boggarts from the third-year curriculum and the new kid... he was impressive."

Emily's eyes gleamed. "Impressive in what way, exactly?" The boys exchanged glances and Emily hummed. "What was his boggart exactly, while we're on the topic?"

"A dementor," answered Selwyn. "It... wasn't the most pleasant experience, but the newbie didn't flinch."

"I'm taking it he had a creative application of the Riddikulus Charm?"

The two boys exchanged glances. "He... didn't actually use that charm first."

"Elaborate."

"He cast a patronus to defend himself before he actually used the Riddikulus Charm," said Selwyn. "I'm guessing he needed some clarity, but it was a fully corporeal patronus; a deer or something similar."

"A stag, I think," Avery put in.

This... was interesting.

Emily knew of the Patronus Charm, of course, but it wasn't one she had spent any great amount of time on. She had tried it a few times to no success before moving on. Finding any information about esoteric magic at Hogwarts was extremely difficult as most things pertaining to that specific area loomed in the castle's darker side of the library.

She had no doubt she could cast the charm today if she had the proper instructions, but it was still interesting. Not every day did somebody new show up at Hogwarts and cast a charm she herself had never performed. Least of all an oddly suspicious transfer student who was a year younger than her.

And there was something about him...

Something that was difficult to describe. His state while around her... it was unnatural and there was a cause; a cause he wanted to hide from her more than anything else.

If he knew the Patronus Charm and could potentially be valuable on top of all the rest... well, she was hardly going to complain about gaining an excuse to solve a puzzle that interested her more than it had any right to.

***September 4, 1942***

***The Potions Classroom***

***11:58 AM***

Class was coming to an end and Harry was surprisingly happy with its results.

Horace had announced at its beginning that he would be assigning them all partners this year. Harry had been hopeful he would end up with Elena. They got on well and Horace had willingly sent him to live with the Fawleys over the summer, so it made a degree of sense to Harry.

But it wasn't to be.

Harry was instead paired with Dorea Black, which was... interesting.

He hadn't been opposed to the idea. He was starting to get the feeling she might have been his year's equivalent of Hermione; not to the same extent, by the looks of it, but perhaps the top student in their year. She also seemed quiet more often than not, which was fine by Harry.

It was just the fact that every time he looked at her, he felt as though he was back in that room after first receiving the cloak of invisibility that he missed so dearly, peering into the depths of an enchanted mirror.

It reminded him painfully of not only the images, but of Professor Dumbledore's words. Words that could really be applied to many things, and words that he had found himself thinking of with disturbing frequency since being thrown back in time.

*"This mirror will give us neither knowledge nor truth, Harry. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. The mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, and I ask you not to go looking for it. If you ever do come across it again, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live. Remember that."*

Remember that he had, particularly the last bit of advice the venerable Headmaster had imparted.

*It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.*

He'd found himself doing that a lot after first landing in the past, but he had slowly begun curbing the habit. Now, faced with a member of his family who had been dead in his time, it became exponentially more difficult.

Which was why it really was a miracle the class had gone as well as it had.

Dorea Black was more gifted in the art of potion-making than she had been in Transfiguration. Despite the fact Harry found himself spacing out due to thoughts he would rather not be having, she managed to keep them on track. They were even the first pair to hand in their completed potion, though she had basically carried him through brewing single-handedly.

"Hey," he said just as the class was about to end. "I know I was a bit rubbish today, so thanks for helping and not just snapping at me. Plenty would have, and I wouldn't really have blamed them."

"You really weren't that bad. Not as present as I might have liked, but you at least listened and followed instructions. It's clear you know what you're doing; you just don't always seem to make the best decisions when it actually comes down to it. Just something to work on, I suppose."

"I'll try," he swore. "I won't be so rubbish the whole year. I just... have a lot on my mind."

"You're the transfer student, right?" He nodded. "It's no surprise then. I'm shocked you're actually doing as well as you are. You have nothing to apologize for..." she trailed off, seeming to grasp the air in hopes of pulling his name from nowhere.

"Harry," he supplied.

"Harry, then. Again, nothing to apologize for; just a lot of stress."

"Thank you," he said genuinely. He might have said more, but he became distracted not a second later.

"Harry, m'boy!" called Slughorn. "Do stay behind for a moment, please. I know lunch is next, so I won't take too much of your time." He chortled as the rest left the class and Harry strode to the front, looking cautiously up at the man who had come to be something of a mentor to him.

"I've arranged a little tour for you tonight," said Slughorn. "Nothing to worry about, of course. Just something to help you settle in is all. Become more comfortable in your new surroundings."

This was, of course, completely unnecessary. Harry had known the castle better than most in his time; with the Marauder's Map having been in his possession, it would have been hard not to.

He didn't say any of this to Slughorn though. He knew the man well enough by now to be sure he was planning something and that this... tour he had set up played into that larger plan.

"What time is it at?" asked Harry. "And who's going to be showing me around? Elena? Dorea?"

"Not quite," Slughorn said with a small smile. "I thought it best if you did it a bit later in the night. Fewer people mucking about and more time for you to... take everything in. As for your tour guide, one of the prefects volunteered. We spoke with her on the train, if you'll remember." Harry felt an odd sense of dread close around his heart, but he said nothing and did his best to show no visible reaction. "You'll be meeting Miss Riddle at the top of the stairs leading down to the dungeons at ten o'clock sharp. She has her prefect rounds to take care of and she volunteered to let you come with her."

He smiled in a way that spoke of exactly how satisfied he was by the whole thing. Harry just couldn't figure out this man's angle. He looked as though he had just given Harry a priceless gift that would stand the test of time. "Does that all sound agreeable to you?"

"Yeah, it's... that works for me."

"Excellent! Well, I won't keep you for too long. I'm sure you're as famished as I am, and lunch awaits." The man gave another chortle as he gestured for Harry to leave the classroom while he cleaned up.

As Harry did so, his mind churning and racing in all sorts of disturbing ways, one odd thought made itself present and he wasn't sure why he found it so morbidly amusing.

Contrary to what Horace had just suggested, he suddenly found himself suffering from a distinct lack of anything even resembling an appetite.

***September 4, 1942***

***The Dungeons***

***10:30 PM***

Harry had never moved so stiffly as when he stepped out of the Slytherin common room that night. Every muscle in his body was as tightly wound as a coiled spring, ready to lunge, dive, or flee at any moment. He could have sworn that the temperature dropped by five degrees the second he stepped into the corridor beyond the common room, but he knew he was imagining the whole thing.

"Good evening."

She spoke quietly, but her voice seemed to ring through Harry's head as if she had shouted at the top of her lungs from the peak of a towering mountain. It cut through the silence of the night like a poisoned dagger. The way Harry's heart seemed to miss a beat, one might think it had been he who the metaphorical blade had pierced.

"Evening," he responded mechanically.

She wore her standard Hogwarts robes with the prefect's badge pinned to her chest. Her long black locks cascaded straight down her back. Not a single hair was out of place, nor was there a blemish anywhere on her pale skin that Harry could see. A small twinge of annoyance pricked at the corner of his mind, but he shoved it aside. It would not do to be upset by something as inconsequential as the fact that Riddle took care of herself.

"How was your first week at Hogwarts?" Riddle asked, gesturing for Harry to follow. She turned and began towards the stone steps that would lead them up to the castle's main floor without a backwards glance.

Harry wondered whether she was that used to people following her without a second thought. It was a disturbing possibility, but one he didn't stop to consider in depth. He hastened to follow her. His shoes echoed against the ancient stones as he moved, but his companion seemed to glide instead of walk. Her steps were so soundless that Harry wondered whether or not she had placed some kind of enchantment on her shoes.

"Decent," answered Harry. "Some classes are easier than others, but they're interesting." He grimaced. "Except for History of Magic." Harry had hoped that Binns might still be alive at this point, but apparently, he was not. Why he had thought that would make the professor any more interesting, Harry wasn't sure.

"Binns is an awful teacher, yes. A shame, really. History is such an important subject, yet no one takes it seriously because of the droning fool who teaches it. There's so much we can learn from history."

Her words sent a strange chill running up Harry's spine, but he said nothing. He thought back to Tom Riddle in the Chamber of Secrets preaching about his own family history. The boy must have been well-versed in more of the past than that if he had found the fabled Chamber of Secrets.

Thoughts of the two Riddles swam to the surface of his mind once more. Their faces seemed to hover beside one another, rotating to rest at different angles for Harry to examine them. He wished he could do more. He wished he had known more about Tom Riddle. It might have helped him compare the boy to his female counterpart in this alternate reality and try to glean the truth. Perhaps it was that he was much too on edge for this meeting, or perhaps he should have taken any available excuse to have not shown up at all. Without much more information, he would never be sure.

"I'm glad you've enjoyed the classes so far, nevertheless," Riddle continued. "How did you fare in Arithmancy and Ancient Runes?"

Harry fought back a scowl as he remembered the test he had taken and horribly failed in Ancient Runes. The answer was not well at all, but he hoped the truth of it was not written too plainly upon his face.

"They were... difficult, but I think I'll manage to figure them out. Arithmancy isn't bad, just a bit head-spinning. Runes was rough, but I'm sure I can work through it."

"Remember what I told you, the offer of help is always open."

He hated how she spoke in a way that sounded so genuine. It just made Harry want to trust her, but he knew doing so would be foolish. He couldn't accept help from Riddle, but every syllable she spoke seemed to draw him in. It was a sort of magnetism he had never experienced and it made him shiver. Or perhaps that was the long, dark shadows that seemed to slither across the floor and leap from wall to wall as the torches flickered and cast them about the corridors. They looked like stalking predators out of the corner of Harry's eye and they were the last things he wanted to see whilst alone with Riddle.

"I'm glad you're confident," she said. "How much of the castle have you gotten to explore so far?"

He shrugged. "Quite a bit of it. It's what I've been spending a lot of my free time doing." What he had actually been putting most of his time into was duelling and practicing with Elena, but Riddle didn't need to know that.

"Which floors have you least explored?"

"The higher the floor, the less time I've spent on it."

They climbed the marble staircase until they stepped onto the third floor. They mostly walked in silence as Riddle periodically flicked her wand. Every time she did, Harry felt... something caress him. He thought it was some kind of magic, but he somehow suspected it had little to do with him. He had no idea what spell she was casting, but after a time, he grew curious enough to ask.

Riddle's lips curved upwards when he did. "The Homenum Revelio Charm. It's a variation of the Revelio Charm that only detects human presences."

He frowned. "So when you cast it and I feel..."

"It's the magic and the way the spell works." There was a light behind Riddle's eyes that Harry had not yet seen. It didn't look like one of malice, or cruelty, or even cunning to Harry. It just looked... passionate? It looked as though they had touched on something that had caught her attention in a way he had not seen it grabbed before. "The spell emanates out from the caster. It spreads out in circular waves.

"So when the spell touches you, it tells the caster that you're there?"

Riddle twirled her wand through long, pale fingers as her other hand idly twirled a lock of raven hair. "Yes and no. It doesn't touch the person --- the spell goes deeper than that."

"Deeper... how?"

"I'm... not entirely sure. It's an extremely complicated spell. Its arithmetic equation is unlike almost any I've seen." That seemed strangely significant, but Harry could not imagine how.

"How do you cast it?" Something hot and foul was boiling in the pit of his stomach. It threatened to rise up and scorch the walls of his throat, but he fought it down. Not until he uttered the words did he realize it was frustration and disappointment; not in Riddle, but in himself. He should not be conversing with her the way he was.

She eyed him carefully. "How good are you with Charms?"

"It's one of my better subjects." It really was now that he had spent a great deal of the summer working on it. "I'm better at Defence Against the Dark Arts, but my Charms work has always been solid."

"It's a NEWT-level spell, so you may have some difficulties, but I've never found it to be terribly difficult." She spun her wand in a swift, sharp circle before jabbing it outwards. The motion was deft and precise; the movements were tight and there was no wasted motion. "The incantation is Homenum Revelio and you must focus. Visualize like you would when transfiguring something."

"What am I visualizing?"

"Where you want the spell to travel. Picture it like a wave flowing out in all directions --- it should move straight through walls, floors, and ceilings."

Harry withdrew his wand and focused on what she said. He played the image of a wave emanating outwards just as she had said and copied the wand movement the best he could.

"Homenum Revelio."

Riddle herself had cast without words, but Harry knew that type of magic was beyond him for now. He didn't expect the spell to work at all on his first try, but he nearly jumped out of his skin when he felt it. It was like a flash of white at the corner of his eye and the overwhelming feeling of knowing exactly where someone was. That someone was Riddle, clearly, and he felt nothing else. The spell had worked! Though something felt... incomplete?

Riddle's eyebrow rose. "A very good first attempt. You felt the spell detect me." It was more a statement than a question, but Harry nodded anyway. Riddle twirled a lock of hair again. "Impressive, Pavonis. A few of my friends have been struggling with that charm. It wasn't perfect --- the spell died after only spreading a few feet from your wand --- but it was a very impressive first attempt."

Harry felt his lips curving up into a smile and bit down hard on his tongue. The metallic taste of blood filled his mouth, but he regretted nothing. He shouldn't be doing this! He shouldn't be asking her for advice, let alone taking it. Smiling at her praise... no. It felt wrong... poisoned, like something about it was tainting his very soul.

Yet his lips wanted to curve upwards and he hated it. He had learned a new spell. That part at least was nice. Yes, better to focus on the learning than the teacher. That was much easier and it made him feel much less guilty as his footsteps continued to echo through the silent halls of Hogwarts castle.

***September 6, 1942***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***9:37 PM***

The clatter of Harry's wand hitting the floor was almost deafening. It seemed to cut through the air like the snapping of a branch in a pitch-black forest late on a noiseless night.

Harry fumed as he walked over towards it, shaking his head slowly as though to clear it. That was what he really needed to do. His thoughts had been a jumbled mess of questions and emotions ever since he had toured the castle that Friday night with Riddle.

He still despised himself for how he had felt about the whole thing. He should have hated every minute of it. Until there was definitive proof that Riddle was not the same monster he had known in his own world, he should be treating her as though she was already Voldemort. Yet he had spoken with her, answered her questions, taken her advice, and almost even smiled at her... and it got worse. He had even spent time practicing the damn spell that next day.

Harry had tried to focus during the duel with Elena, but she had cast a spell he had never seen before. It caused a thick veil of smoke to rise and cloud the very air around the room. Harry found himself unable to see three feet in front of him as he choked and gasped for breath. The thought of the Homenum Revelio Charm had crossed his mind then and he had raised his wand. Then his brain had caught up. It was so wrong. If he used the spell Riddle had taught him to beat Elena... but he *had* to beat Elena. If he couldn't beat Elena, what good would he be if Riddle ever became the monster he had once known?

It had been the pause that cost him. A bolt of crimson light had appeared from out of the smoke barely three feet away from Harry and he had been unable to dodge in time. The spell had ripped his wand from his hand and sent it spinning through the air and bouncing across the classroom's floor. His concentration had lapsed and his thoughts had cost him --- thoughts that still lurked, impatient and unresolved.

Damnit!

"Are you all right, Harry?"

"Fine," he answered shortly, scowling as he snatched up his wand and whirled to face her.

Elena blanched and Harry frowned. He wondered if he had really looked that bothered. "Sorry," he said, "I didn't mean to come off as snappish. I'm just... annoyed."

"You should be," said Elena. "Any time I've beaten you lately, it was after a long and drawn-out duel when I used something you didn't expect." She scrunched up her face as though she smelled something unpleasant. "And those times haven't been often." She watched him closely. "Are you sure you're okay?"

What on Earth could he tell her? That learning magic from a girl who might grow up to murder his future parents was bothering him? That he felt as though he was consorting with the darkest magician to ever grace the British Isles? That his mind had been plagued with the words the Riddle of his time had spoken whilst down in the Chamber of Secrets.

*"There are strange likenesses between us, after all. Even you must have noticed. Both half bloods, orphans, raised by Muggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself. We even look something alike..."*

"I'm fine. Really. Just... distracted."

It was a kind word for it, but there was nothing else he could say. He felt trapped.

He remembered all the times he had wanted to tell one of the teachers at his old primary school about how horrible Dudley was, but he knew it would be to no avail. That was what this felt like, but the stakes were so much higher. This wasn't about bullying and abuse. This was about destruction and murder.

Well... maybe.

His hand twitched and he had to fight the urge to slam it into his own forehead. A sharp stab of pain manifested behind his eyes. It felt almost as though his scar was burning, but it had not so much as twinged since he had landed in the past.

"Let's go again." Harry raised his wand and took aim at Elena.

The youngest member of House Fawley looked hesitant, though she stepped gracefully into her stance after a moment\'s pause and allowed a look of determination to rest upon her features.

***September 7, 1942***

***The Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom***

***9:10 AM***

The air was thick with tension in the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom the Monday after the students had arrived at Hogwarts. Their first lesson in the class had been an interesting one to say the very least. It featured a boggart, a pseudo-dementor, and the Patronus Charm. It had been by far the most eventful lesson Harry had experienced since arriving back in the past and he could only wonder how this one would compare.

"Pavonis," barked Merrythought, "to the front of the class with Fawley!" She pointed sharply to the front row of desks. Harry scowled but hid it behind his hand, feigning a yawn. He disliked people sitting behind him.

"She likes you," Elena whispered as they moved towards their designated places.

"She's got a funny way of showing it," Harry muttered back.

Elena rolled her eyes. "It's Merrythought. She doesn't really do affection. You just learn to look for certain things." She shot him a conspiratorial glance. "She always puts her favourites in the front. I think it's so they can get a better view and the like." Now it was Elena's face that scrunched up in distaste. "And so she can pester you with questions... I do wish she wouldn't do that."

Harry sat at the furthest desk to the left in the front row, with Elena to his right and Dorea Black to hers. Merrythought waited for all students to be seated before standing from behind her desk. She did not immediately speak. She paced before them like a rabid lion stalking its prey. It only added to the mounting sensations of anticipation and tension.

"Fourth year at Hogwarts is when students in this class start learning about curses and the like. You really ought to be taught them sooner, but I don't write the curriculum. What I do approve of is that, this year, they've made a major change to the way we do things.

"The ministry is finally waking up and realizing that we have a war on our hands. It's because of the war that the curriculum in this class is changing. They've finally decided not to baby you all the way through to N.E.W.Ts. They've decided to let me show all of you what the worst of the worst really is."

She flicked her wand and a drawer opened on her desk. A box floated out of it. Harry could hear shuffling and squeaking from within the box and wondered why until it was opened. Several mice tried to escape right away, but Merrythought cast some sort of spell around the box and they seemed unable to move past the container's edge.

"Curses come in many shapes and forms. Some curses don't do all that much damage. The Full Body-Bind is technically a curse. Who can tell me what that curse does?"

She pointed to a dark-haired Slytherin near the front of the class who Harry remembered was called Avery. "It paralyzes the target. Their arms and legs become pinned to their body and they're unable to move a muscle."

"Correct --- take three points for Slytherin. Anyhow, there are curses like the Full Body-Bind that only cause temporary paralysis, but there are things much worse. There are curses that can burn you from the inside out, curses that make breathing impossible, curses that shatter bone, and curses that obliterate organs."

Her expression was suddenly very hard and Harry could not help but wonder whether or not he had ever heard a class so quiet. Their complete and undivided attention was fixated upon Merrythought, who watched them all with a stern yet pensive expression.

"And yet," she continued, "none of these are the curses that the Ministry of Magic deems as the worst of the worst. There are several curses that they categorize as being... unforgivable."

Harry could hear robes rustle as students shifted nervously in their seats. He cast his eyes about the room and saw that many gathered were stone-faced. Elena was among them, as was Dorea. Avery was less stoic. Every muscle in his face seemed as though it had been pulled tight, like an elastic band stretched to its breaking point. Harry thought he looked as though he was trying his best to suppress some sort of expression. What exactly that was, he was unsure.

Merrythought had pulled a mouse from the box during the time Harry had looked away and set it on the desk. The thing was squeaking and scampering like mad, but Merrythought kept blocking its retreat.

"There are three curses that the Ministry of Magic holds more evil than any other spells. They are called the Unforgivable Curses because the use of any of them on a fellow human being would immediately earn the caster a life sentence in Azkaban."

Harry shuddered at the mere mention of the prison. He could practically hear the dementor's deep, rasping breath and feel the oppressive cold settle over him like an invisible blanket of ice.

"Luckily," the professor continued, "the ministry doesn't say anything about casting them on animals, so I can show you exactly what it is you might deal with if terrorists decide to attack Britain again."

She took a step back and raised her wand before taking aim at the mouse. It was still scampering this way and that, but Merrythought didn't move her wand. She just waited for it to run into the line of fire, at which point she barked out her incantation in a sharp, whip of a voice.

"Crucio!"

There was no burst of magic following the incantation --- no flash of light, puff of smoke, or any sort of loud and dramatic bang.

The fact only made it all the more disturbing when the creature collapsed midstep, rolled over onto its back, and began letting out a horrible, wheezing stream of squeaks. They were so high and sudden that it sounded like a sonic boom. Except for the fact that it didn't end. The cacophony rose and stretched on as it mounted until the sound seemed to pierce not just Harry's ears, but his very skin and bones. The mouse's legs were twitching now as if arcs of electricity raced through the creature's veins like fast-flowing blood.

It was over as fast as it had begun. The creature collapsed in on itself as soon as Merrythought lifted her wand. Its little chest heaved, but all of its other muscles seemed to have given up some time ago. It still breathed, but it dangled limply as Merrythought tossed it back into the box and withdrew one of its companions. She held it aloft above the desk as she turned to the class. Harry wasn't sure whether to be impressed or disturbed at how unphased the woman seemed by the whole thing.

"That was the Cruciatus Curse," she explained. "For those of you duller than an ancient quill, it's the most potent torture curse that exists. It over stimulates every nerve and causes pain the likes of which you could never imagine. Muscles have been known to tear due to the stress, people's minds have been lost, and their hearts have stopped. There are even some cases of victims tearing out their own eyes or throats."

Many of the faces dotted around the room were as grey as the rain-flecked sky outside. They still all watched Merrythought, though a few did so with what seemed to be reluctance. Elena seemed as though she might be sick. Harry felt a touch queasy himself, but nothing more. He had seen his best friend and godfather have their souls sucked out by rotting creatures who feasted on happiness itself. Hearing a mouse squeak was nothing compared to that.

"Some say the Cruciatus Curse is the kindest of the three," said Merrythought, setting the second mouse down upon the desk and turning her wand towards it. "I'll let you all be the judge of that."

Harry wondered what would come next. Was one of these spells something like the dementor's kiss? Was there something worse? Or was the rising suspicion in the pit of his gut about to be proven right? Merlin... he hoped not.

"Imperio!"

Watching the first mouse do its best impression of a human's agonized scream had been gut-wrenching in its own way, but seeing the second follow each and every command Merrythought uttered without a single thought was every bit as terrifying. What disturbed Harry the most was that some of the commands she gave the creature should have been well outside of its capabilities. Yet, the mouse complied --- and succeeded.

Harry's gut twisted when he realized that he was intrigued by the fact. He wondered what the spell's limits were. Would a witch or wizard placed under its power be able to perform magic they had never seen before? Would they be able to leap higher than any man before them? Would they be able to run faster than humans had thought possible? There were so many possibilities, yet Harry knew he should be considering none of them.

He wasn't sure how disturbed he may have been had the thought been allowed to linger, but the professor was already withdrawing the third mouse from the box with a grim expression.

"That was the Imperius Curse. I'm sure I don't need to tell any of you what it does. I should point out that the curse can be fought, but only by one with extraordinary will or certain training that I doubt many in this room will ever undertake. Training that I will not provide. The ministry wants you to know what you're fighting, but the curses when cast upon another human are unforgivable for a reason." Her eyes darkened. "Which brings us to the final curse of the set."

She set the mouse down upon the desk and raised her wand with a flourish. Harry's heart was beating faster now. It was as though the muscle knew what was coming next, even as his mind contemplated whether or not this would be what he was dreading so deeply...

"Avada Kedavra!"

It was as he remembered. The room was alight with pale green light brighter and more vivid than any emerald. There was a sound, too. It was akin to the sound a whip might make whilst sailing through the air, but a hundred times worse. It seemed to resonate within Harry and echo off the very walls of his chest. It was a rushing sound that whistled with the promise of what would come next, though there was no impact.

Just that blinding flash of light and then nothing at all. When the vibrant spell faded, the third and final mouse was lying motionless upon the desk. Harry remembered the way its counterpart's chest had heaved after being tortured, but there was nothing of the sort this time around. It had fallen like a puppet with its strings cut and Harry knew it would never rise again.

He pressed his eyes tightly shut as unbidden memories surged forth. Memories of long and miserable nights in his cupboard. The way Aunt Petunia's hurried knocking would not just wake him, but pull him suddenly from that halo of green light. Sometimes when he awoke, it would still be stained upon the inside of his eyelids, or so it would seem.

Yet the dreams paled in comparison to the thing itself. He had seen it last year --- well... fifty-and-a-bit years from now --- whenever a dementor had drawn too near. The way that sickly light had filled the room as his mother stood before him, arms outstretched as though crucified before the light took her and snuffed her life out as swiftly and easily as an extinguished candle.

"Harry?" It was Elena who had spoken. Her voice was a whisper right beside his ear, though it might as well have come from a hundred miles away. Harry didn't react. He heard it vaguely, but he just let it wash over him like fast-falling water droplets. His eyes were fixed unblinkingly on the front of the room. His expression was unmoving and unchanging.

He felt nothing. It was strange to know he should feel sick, or hurt, or angry, or even depressed. It scared him to know that emotions should be crashing against his walls like a hundred battering rams, yet they simply failed to reach him. They were more like arrows fired from afar against a strong and vengeful wind. They might have rushed forth with malicious intent, but they would never reach their target. They would never pierce Harry's wall of numb shock and force him to feel.

"The Killing Curse," Merrythought said softly. "Some say it's the worst of the three while others say it is a mercy. What makes the curse so powerful is that it never fails. No one has ever been hit by that spell and lived to tell the tale." Her expression was as blank as Harry's. "And just like the other two, there is no known form of magic that can block or shield someone from it."

Only the lives of the people who could have made Harry's childhood worth living, he thought. That was the price to survive the unblockable Avada Kedavra curse. It was a price he had paid in full. He would never know what his life may have been like had the debt not been levied upon him, all he knew was that it was a price much too high to ask of anyone. All he knew was that no matter how long it took or how treacherous the path might be, he was going to do his best to ensure that no man, woman, or child had to pay that price.

***September 18, 1942***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***9:24 PM***

It was late at Hogwarts and the halls seemed quiet. Shadows emerged from patches of light cast by flickering torches and crawled slowly up the walls. Footsteps belonging to the few patrolling students and professors echoed loudly on the hard-stone floor and reverberated through the ancient walls. The loudest thing in the castle was Peeves, who was streaking down corridors, rattling suits of armour, and being a general menace.

Nobody would ever know that a war was raging inside one of the castle's long-abandoned classrooms. They could not see the lights flashing so fast they might well have been seizure inducing. They could not hear the sounds of stray spells slamming against the desks and walls, nor could they hear the panting breaths of the two combatants or their feet sliding across the floor in hasty bids to avoid the others' most potent bits of offence. If any were to approach this classroom, they would suddenly find themselves possessed by the strangest feeling of forgetfulness and the sudden urge to retrieve whatever object they had forgotten.

Yet spells were flying inside the classroom and bodies were moving..

The male figure avoided three jets of red light, spun on his heel, and swished his wand towards what remained of the desks piled into one of the room's corners. They had been broken into splinters by a stray Reductor Curse earlier in the night, but all of the remaining pieces rose into the air and propelled themselves towards the man's female counterpart. She raised her wand and with it rose a solid magical shield that deflected the debris, but she had taken her eyes off of her opponent.

"Bombarda!"

The wall of force slammed so hard into the girl's shield that she staggered as her defences fell. Duelling her opponent was always vexing. It wasn't enough that he was more skillful; his spells also just so happened to be naturally more potent than hers.

A jet of water flowed from her opponent's wand and sprayed the floor all around her. She twirled gracefully away from it and managed to come out virtually untouched, but the floor beneath her feet was a sheet of ice a moment later and the duel ended soon after.

Harry pushed back a sweaty mop of raven hair as soon as it did. His mouth hung ajar and his chest rose and fell in time with his deep, heaving breaths. Fatigued or not, there was an ear-to-ear grin plastered across his face.

Elena grumbled as she retrieved her wand. "I swear," she said, "I beat you a couple of nights in a row when you're distracted and you suddenly become twice the duellist you were? This is utter rubbish!"

Harry shrugged. "I realized duelling you while distracted wasn't doing anything for me. I could make better use of that time, so I did."

"The water," she prompted, "I'm guessing you learned that one of these nights you were locked in the library?"

"Yup --- thought it would take me longer to get that one. It's a sixth-year conjuration, but I didn't find it all that hard."

"Harry, you don't usually find most magic all that hard."

He grimaced. "Ancient Runes would like urgent words with you."

She laughed then, and the sound of it made him grin once more. "That doesn't count and you know it."

"Tell that to Slughorn. He's been getting on my case about it in Potions lately. Polite and all that, but he's worried about it. Wish I could blame him. Should never have taken his advice; there was no way I was ever gonna pass that class."

"You can pass. Professor Anderson has always been good about students needing more help---"

"Elena, there's needing more help, and then there's being an entire year behind. They're not the same thing."

He and Ron had needed more help in some of their classes during his reality, but they had never failed them. Ancient Runes for him right now was like what every class must have felt like for Crabbe and Goyle --- if Crabbe and Goyle had smashed their heads against the wall until they lost the few brain cells they had left.

"I'm sure you'll figure it out. With how fast you're improving with a wand, I don't see why you can't improve that way in Runes."

She didn't get it. Nor did he, really, but he understood more than her. Ever since landing fifty years in the past, Harry had put a great deal more effort into learning new magic. He had swiftly realized that most of it really did come quite easily to him once he understood what it was he was trying to do. Transfiguration and Charms just... flowed. It was hard to describe, but he never found them difficult. Ancient Runes was quite the opposite. Trying to translate all those dead languages was like trying to look into Trelawney's crystal ball. He saw nothing but useless vapour and mist that he had no hope of deciphering.

He twirled his wand absentmindedly as he thought. He wished he had known about this affinity for practical magic the first time around. Perhaps it would have saved Sirius or Hermione, and perhaps he would never have landed here in the first place.

It really was startling. His practice and learning had exponentially increased in the weeks following Professor Merrythought's lesson on the Unforgivable Curses. Seeing the Killing Curse performed live and in person had stirred something deep inside Harry. It was like the end of his first year when he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt he needed to go after the Philosopher's Stone. He knew he needed to get better. He knew that being good for his age wasn't going to cut it when faced with something like that.

Especially not with Emily Riddle lurking in the shadows at every moment of the day. He felt her eyes on him at meals sometimes, and other nights it was in the common room when her gaze found him. Those nights had been scarce until recently, for much of his time had been spent reading in the library, practicing in long-forgotten classrooms, or practicing in secret passages he had found --- or remembered from the Marauder's Map.

He had needed the distraction after that lesson. It had eventually turned into a powerful motivator, but the days following it had not been pleasant. Harry would never before have experienced such a dark and depressing mood had he not seen Hermione and Sirius have their souls sucked out right before his eyes. Seeing the Killing Curse in person had been worse than the dementors and their torment in his third year and it had left him in desperate need of distraction. Only in the past week or so had he begun to feel as though he was finally moving on from seeing bursts of green light every time he shut his eyes or tried to force his brain to rest.

"We'll see," he said. "I'd rather not fail the damn thing if I can avoid it, but I'm not sure I can at this point." At least not in a way that he liked. Thoughts of being tutored by Riddle still haunted him --- even more so after seeing the green light and hearing the rush of death in Merrythought's classroom almost two weeks ago.

"Well, at least I'll beat you in one thing this year."

"Three," said Harry. "I'm not exactly an arithmetic genius and the only reason I'm looking half as good in Potions as I am is because Black is my partner."

"You seem to get along well with Dorea."

"We don't talk all that much. Just when giving each other updates and the odd time when she corrects me or asks me to do something. We talked a bit the first time we were paired up, not much since then."

"Still, you could do worse for a partner."

"Of course I could. Slughorn's the professor; he was never going to pair me up with anyone who wasn't going to boost my grade."

"I still don't get it," she said quietly.

"Get what?"

"Get why he's so interested in you. Like... you're really good at wanded magic and he realized that before the rest of us, but so what? So are a lot of people. He obviously thought you had a bright future and wanted to latch onto you, it just seems... excessive. He does this sort of thing with a lot of top students, but I've never seen him go this far for anyone." She paused and began to chew on her lip. Harry had noticed that about Elena. She usually did that whenever there was something she wasn't telling him.

"Except for Riddle," he put together. "He's just as fond of her as he is with me." Elena nodded, though she did not meet his eyes. "Great company I'm keeping, then." He cast his gaze about the room as he tried to decide what to say. "Elena... what exactly is up with Riddle?"

He could see the tension sneak into her then, see the way she began to twitch, and see the way her feet turned so her body was squared off to his. "What do you mean?" she asked. "There's nothing---"

"Elena, you're terrified of her. You have been ever since Diagon Alley. Why?"

"She's just... just..."

"Has she ever done anything to you?" Elena shook her head. "But you've seen her do things? To other people, I mean."

"Harry, I'd really rather not."

"Why? What does it matter? She can't hear us here. This is as safe a spot as we'll find at Hogwarts. I just want to know what's up with her. Everyone treats her like some sort of royalty."

"She's... different. She's better than all of us, even you. I've... never seen anyone do things like Riddle. The things she can do... she has powers that I could never imagine."

Hairs stood straight up on the back of Harry's neck as his skin began to crawl.

Powers that Elena could never imagine...

*"Dobby has heard Dumbledore's powers rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength. But, sir... there are powers Dumbledore doesn't... powers no decent wizard..."*

Two descriptions of Riddle's powers from two extremely different sources. Yet there was a common and troubling theme.

Harry focused his attention back towards Elena and opened his mouth to continue his questioning, but she had taken a hold of her wand once more and turned to face him. It appeared that losing five duels in a row was not enough for the night, and so the moment passed before he had his chance to ask any more of her.

***September 21, 1942***

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***10:11 PM***

Harry's mood continued to improve after winning the mock duels with Elena. He was more suspicious of Emily Riddle than ever and Ancient Runes was as troublesome as it had ever been, but elsewise all was well.

He had continued to work just as diligently on spells and the like as he had when his mood had been at rock bottom. The reminder of Riddle's powers even at her age was troubling, but it jolted him down the path of improvement. He knew he could not be so hopelessly outmatched as he had been in his own time.

The Monday after his failed attempt at prying for information about Riddle saw him in the library for several hours after classes, then an abandoned classroom after that. He eventually returned to the common room, but by the time he did, curfew had been in effect for some time. Many of the younger years appeared to have retreated for the night. Elena herself was nowhere to be seen, though it was no surprise. She woke early and was usually unable to stay up late at night. Harry himself had little to do. No homework was due tomorrow seeing as it was only the first day of the week. Sleep did not sound like such a horrible idea until a snippet of conversation reached his ears as he tried to cross the common room, aiming for the tunnel sloping off of the main room and leading to the boys' dormitories.

"I don't know why you entertain Myrtle, Riddle. She's insufferable and not worth the grime on your boots."

It was a voice that Harry did not immediately recognize, but something about it sounded familiar. Not until he glanced over his shoulder towards the source of the sound did he know exactly why that was the case.

The boy who had spoken was tall and had a graceful sort of air about him. He had a slightly upturned nose, cold grey eyes, and shining blond hair that tumbled down his shoulders and fell in elegant curtains on either side of his face. He was unmistakably a Malfoy and Harry would be willing to bet a significant number of galleons that he was Lucius's father.

Another boy with short brown hair stood beside him. He was shorter and more thick-set, but Harry's attention passed right over him. Surprise had swelled within him at seeing someone who looked so similar to a person he had known, but his brain had caught up swiftly enough and alerted him to exactly what he was listening in on. Then his eyes got the memo and swept over the two seventh-year boys, landing on the group of students whose leader they were addressing.

Riddle was sitting in the midst of her group of followers. They were spread across several sofas clustered around the fireplace. She herself was sat dead centre on one of the closest to. Cassiopeia Black was sitting on one side of her and Felix Rosier sat on the other.

All in her group raised their heads at the two seven years' approach, but Riddle did so almost lazily. "Can I help you, Abraxas?"

"I think in this case you can. I recall asking you a question."

"Do you?" Riddle twirled a stray lock of hair around a long, pale finger. "May I ask you to repeat your question?"

Harry could see the muscles in the other boy's jaw tense as he stood to Abraxas's right. Harry thought he remembered the boy's name was Nott, though he wasn't sure.

"The Ravenclaw mudblood who hangs off of you any chance she gets," said the boy Harry thought was Nott. "Why do you entertain her? You ought to have taught the bitch her place ages ago."

Riddle tilted her head. "Are you concerned, Edward?"

"Excuse me?"

"You've done your best to stay away from my sphere of influence these past few years. I can't imagine why you are suddenly so interested in to whom I give my time and attention."

"That isn't an answer."

"No, I don't suppose it is." She folded her hands in her lap as she looked directly towards the two boys for the first time. "I suppose I just thought the answer was really quite simple."

"Did you?" asked Abraxas as his lip curled. "How about you elaborate for those of us who are not so renowned for our intellect?"

"Of course, my apologies for assuming." She smiled, but even Harry could tell it was a poisonous smile. "You see, I have never quite managed to grasp why the composition of one's blood should dictate how useful they could be to me."

An absolute stillness gripped the common room and seemed to strangle the air from every inch and corner. Edward Nott looked as though every muscle was coiled so tightly he might snap at any moment. The reactions around the room seemed to vary. Harry did not miss the sneers, but nor did he notice how none of them were willing to show the expression so openly.

All but Abraxas, who displayed his before Riddle like a shining badge of honour. "I see." Malfoy's voice was low and smoother than the finest of silks. "Has it ever crossed your mind that such beliefs may reflect poorly on you?"

"I care not for reflections, but realities. People can think of me whatever they like. If their beliefs become problematic, I will be happy to dissuade them. Otherwise, their opinions don't matter." Riddle smiled up at Abraxas from her seat on the couch once again. "I would be happy to dissuade any beliefs you yourself might have if you would like? I wouldn't want who I choose to use to impact how one as... important as yourself looks upon me."

A shiver ran up Harry's spine. Riddle was a predator stalking her prey. He wondered if Abraxas realized that. He looked much too calm for one who had basically just been challenged to a duel by one of the most brilliant magicians to ever live.

"I don't think that will be necessary quite yet," he said. "If I have objections, I think I will take them up elsewhere."

"See that you do," said Riddle. "It was a pleasure, as always, but I find these types of conversations dull and monotonous."

"I will make sure to avoid the conversations in future dealings." Abraxas moved away swiftly but with dignity. Harry was impressed that the boy did not fidget. Riddle's stare on his back seemed too intense for him not to feel it. Harry shuddered at the thought of that stare on him and moved out of the main common room before that thought could become any more than that.

***September 25, 1942***

***The Potions Classroom***

***11:56 AM***

The week aged with little drama, but the workload in classes was beginning to swell. This was fine for Harry in all of the wanded subjects, but Ancient Runes and even Arithmancy were beginning to become truly problematic. There was something to what Elena had said, he thought. If he had been willing to spend a few of the hours he was using for practice to improve on these subjects, he might well have found himself in a much more favourable standing. The problem was that Harry did not view either of them as being especially important when compared to gaining the tools he would need to deal with the potential rise of Voldemort.

Friday morning saw Harry sitting beside Dorea Black once more as they maneuvered their way through brewing antidotes --- the most difficult task Slughorn had set them so far this year. They would be expected to brew them without partners next week as a test, so Harry was shadowing Dorea very closely and taking notes as the class stretched on. He thought of Ron and Hermione less and less as time trudged along, but he suspected his bushy-haired friend would have been unreasonably pleased by his sudden desire to be studious; even if a large part of that had more to do with Slughorn than it did the class itself.

The man himself showered both Harry and Dorea with praise when class neared its end and he inspected their potion. "Why, I'd struggle to brew anything this couldn't cure," he had said with a wink, awarding Slytherin House ten points and moving to the next students in line.

Harry had just finished packing his things as they all prepared to depart for lunch when Slughorn called for him. "Harry, m'boy, stay behind, will you?"

"Of course, sir," said Harry. "Don't bother," he told Elena, seeing that she was going to offer to stay behind. "It probably won't take long; I'll catch up with you easily enough."

"Can you believe the first month of the year is almost over?" Slughorn asked once the rest of the class had vacated the room. Harry could believe it, actually. The first two weeks had dragged, having been weighed down by great amounts of mental and emotional stress. The last two had passed by quickly, though, so he shook his head and did his best to smile nevertheless. "Being Head of Slytherin House does have its perks," Slughorn went on. "We do get to read the reports of all our students at each month's end."

Harry felt droplets of sweat begin to form on his palms. This was going to be about Ancient Runes. He had failed another test this week; there was no way that wasn't where Slughorn was going with this tangent. The worst part was that Harry couldn't even think of any decent reply that might dissuade his professor's worries.

"I'm sorry about Ancient Runes, sir." He supposed the best way to deal with the elephant in the room was just to get it out of the way. "Arithmancy too, I guess, but I've been doing a bit better in that class lately."

"I'm not upset with your performance, Harry. That's only natural. Being a year behind --- it was always going to happen." He fixed him with a stern expression. "What I am disappointed with is that you didn't come to me sooner. You know I have help lined up for you and I'd have set something up."

Harry's heart was beating so loudly that he thought the roar of it in his ears would give him a headache. "Sorry, sir."

Slughorn sighed and waved a hand. "Not to worry, not to worry. You're young and proud; I ought to have expected it." The professor wiped sweat from his brow. Harry could not blame him. This room really did get stiflingly hot when the fumes of brewing potions and the heat of simmering cauldrons filled the air. "Do Friday evenings work for you?"

"P-pardon, sir?"

"To be tutored, m'boy. I spoke to Emily about it yesterday. She told me --- kind and generous girl that she is --- that she would make any time convenient for you work for her."

Harry wondered how much Riddle suspected. Was it possible she knew he was wary of this and had taken away his out from the onset? He supposed it was, but that would imply she badly wanted these sessions to happen. She had been more than willing, but she had no reason to desire his presence. Surely he was being much too paranoid, even though his heart and gut seemed to disagree with a painful, wrenching passion.

"That... works for me, sir." If he had more time to think, perhaps he could have come up with something, but he didn't.

Something about his displeasure or apprehension must have shown on his face, for Slughorn clapped him on the shoulder and smiled at him merrily. "Nothing to worry about, m'boy. If anyone can get you back on track, it's that girl. Besides," he continued with a chuckle, "it's not all bad news."

"It's not?"

"Of course not! You've been brilliant in Albus's class and Charms as well. But your work in Defence Against the Dark Arts has been sublime." He winked. "So sublime that I have plans for you. Trust me, Harry, you'll go far in the field. I haven't been wrong yet and I'm going to make sure this isn't the first time. Just leave it with me, m'boy, and you'll know soon."

Harry was dismissed with a final wave. He left the classroom, uncertain whether he was more nervous about private lessons with Emily Riddle or about whatever the hell else Slughorn had in store for him.

***The Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom***

***12:01 PM***

It was the first time Harry had found himself alone in a room with Professor Merrythought. It had happened often enough with Slughorn, but this felt different. Slughorn was someone he was at least vaguely familiar with. He thought he had an idea of how the man's mind worked. Merrythought was still largely an unknown entity. She seemed fond of him, but he doubted that would stop her from making his life hell if she felt she had a reason. The heavy curtains pulled tight across the windows didn't help his nerves. Rays of bright light could have lightened the feel of the room, but they were instead left in thick and heavy darkness.

Merrythought also had a very different air about her. Slughorn seemed to radiate joviality --- though Harry suspected it was just an act. Merrythought was similar to McGonagall from his time in the sense that she was notoriously strict. He felt that now, wondering exactly what he had done to earn this meeting.

The most off-putting thing for Harry was that he had not been told to stay as the class's duration dwindled. Merrythought had sent him a letter that morning requesting his presence. Never had a professor done so before. It made him tense and think he was somehow in trouble, though he could not decide what he may have done to earn himself the professor's ire.

"Thank you for coming," the professor said, taking a seat behind her desk and reaching for a glass of tea.

"It's no trouble, Professor." Harry had to resist the urge to shuffle from side to side. This did not seem like the woman to fidget in front of.

"You look nervous," she observed.

"Just a bit confused, ma'am. I've never had a professor write me a letter to stay after class before."

"I can't say I make a habit of it. I'm not sure I've ever done it before now. Don't let yourself get too smug," she said when Harry's lips parted. They slid into an expression of surprise rather than smugness, but the interjection was quite characteristic of the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor.

"Just surprised again," Harry said hastily.

"Yes, I'm sure." She set down her mug of tea and looked up at him. Her stare was sharp. It did not seem to penetrate him so much as it tore him open and examined him via a forceful dissection. "Did Professor Slughorn tell you he was writing to me?"

This threw Harry completely for a loop. "No, ma'am. The last time I talked to Professor Slughorn was mostly about Ancient Runes."

"I thought not," she said, her mouth straightening into a thin line that reminded him so much of the woman who had served as his Head of House in a different world. "Do you have any guesses as to what he may have written to me about?" Harry shook his head, but the woman's stare did not detach itself from him. "What have your thoughts been about this class so far?"

Harry's head tilted as he stared back at his professor with narrowed eyes. Gears turned inside his head but they seemed to stall and grind painfully against one another as he tried to suss out exactly what was going on here. That last transition had clearly been planned, but it was still as jarring as a blow dealt by a speeding bludger.

"It's... been interesting."

The professor's eyes narrowed. "You need to choose your words more carefully, Pavonis. I highly doubt it's been interesting for the likes of you."

Harry blinked several times. "I don't understand, Professor."

"I have no doubt you've enjoyed the class. You're too gifted at it not to be at least a little bit interested. Children often enjoy what they're good at and I can't say I've ever seen a fourth year cast a Patronus Charm before now. Interesting, though. I think you've moved much too easily through the material for it to be interesting." She tapped her fingers rhythmically upon the desk. "Unless you fancy yourself a narcissist. I suppose being better than your peers might be interesting to you, then. Is that it, Pavonis?"

"No," Harry scrambled to say. "No, that's not what I meant."

Merrythought nodded. "I thought not. Choose your words more carefully. Simple things can have you looking like a fool."

"I'll... keep that in mind, Professor."

"See that you do." She opened one of the drawers of her desk and produced a letter scrawled on what appeared to be a pristine bit of parchment. It was smoother than any Harry had seen since arriving in the past. All manner of things seemed more weathered here. Parchment, fabrics, shops, streets --- all of them and more had felt the effects of the war. Whether it was Grindelwald's war or the one in the muggle world contributing most heavily, Harry had no idea.

"This," said the professor, "is the letter from Professor Slughorn." Her gaze suddenly became sterner than it had been since that first day when Harry had arrived late. "I shouldn't let you read it. It speaks about another student. Can I trust that you won't run your mouth to the first of your friends who asks you about its contents in the next few weeks?"

Confusion rose within Harry like billowing steam from boiling water, but he nodded nevertheless and removed the offered parchment from his professor's grasp.

*Dearest Professor Merrythought,*

*It has been so long since we properly caught up. Perhaps we should amend this soon. Maybe we can even talk about the subject of my letter.*

*I think that by now, you will have noticed that young Master Pavonis is quite the pupil and that I was not exaggerating when I wrote of him over the summer. I think you will likely have found him quite exceptional.*

*I would like to reopen the argument we hashed out late in the summer. Your point about Miss Riddle stands. She was an exceptional student who did not get the treatment I am proposing, but by Merlin, she should have. I asked for it then and I am asking for it now. I doubt even you can argue Emily was not advanced enough at her age to leap ahead of her peers. I personally see no way you can honestly tell me that Harry isn't in that same position.*

*Do consider my proposition again. I would be happy to debate it out over a glass of wine and a box of crystallized pineapple.*

*Yours truly,*

*Professor H. F. Slughorn*

Harry blinked at the parchment a number of times. The words were there and he had no trouble reading them. He even understood them, but that didn't mean he had the foggiest idea what any of them meant. Him and Riddle being compared? That seemed wrong from the onset and it stirred memories that caused bile to rise up his throat. Memories of the Chamber of Secrets and how Tom Riddle had dared to liken the two of them to one another.

"So," said the professor, "what do you think?"

"I'm... not sure what it means?"

"Aren't you? Has Professor Slughorn not run this by you already?"

"No, ma'am."

"Truly?" She tapped her fingers on the edge of her desk again. "I'm not at all surprised he didn't tell you the wheels were in motion, but I'd have thought the two of you were in this together. How very interesting." She fixed him with a pensive stare. "Will you answer my next question honestly, Pavonis?"

"Yes, ma'am."

"Have you found yourself bored in my class?"

"Not... bored, no."

"Unchallenged? Unmotivated? Unfulfilled?"

"I'm motivated by the subject, just---"

"Just not by the class. Yes, that much is obvious. The amount of work you put into the subject outside of this class shows very clearly."

"Thank you, Professor."

"But," Merrythought went on, "what is just as clear is that you are completely unchallenged by the course material and that you being in this class only hurts your peers."

Harry swore his head nearly snapped back from the force of Merrythought's words. "Professor?"

"I'm not the only one who notices your prowess. It is obvious to any with a working set of eyes. The others have noticed. I'm sure it is difficult for you to relate, but it is challenging to stay motivated when you watch others perform the tasks you're struggling with as easily as if they were casting a Lumos Charm."

Oh, if Merrythought only knew. It wasn't difficult at all for Harry to imagine. It had been his reality not all that long ago. Watching Hermione breeze through each and every subject even while taking all that the school allowed had been infuriating even whilst he was proud of his bushy-haired friend. Merrythought need not explain the pains of those sitting in that position.

It was actually a very strange thought. To imagine himself as Hermione in this circumstance was... strange. A lot really had changed. Not just the gender of his parents' murderer and the time during which he was alive. Harry had changed just as much, and the fact had never been so glaringly obvious as it was then, staring at his watchful professor.

"What are you saying exactly?"

Merrythought nodded and for the first time, Harry thought she looked pleased. "I'm saying that you have no need for this class." She raised a hand to forestall the inevitable interjection. "Listen more closely, boy. You have need for the subject, but not the class."

"Are you saying I should drop Defence Against the Dark Arts? It's mandatory through fifth year, isn't it?"

"It is and I am not. What I am saying is that you should not be taking fourth-year Defence Against the Dark Arts, but the fifth-year course ."

Shock slammed into Harry with the force of a concussive blow. He nearly staggered from its impact. If he still had need for glasses, he thought they might have shattered from the weight of the shock.

"Professor... are you saying---"

"I am saying that your time in this class is over. I have no time to waste on pupils who don't need it. The jump in difficulty will be vital for you, I think. I doubted it in the summer, but you've been steadily convincing me ever since you cast that Patronus Charm. Professor Slughorn had a point, even if I'm sure his motives aren't quite as pure as he would have you believe."

"What do you mean by that?" asked Harry. "About Professor Slughorn, I mean?"

"I mean that Professor Slughorn exemplifies the traits your house is famous for and that he recognizes your potential more clearly than any of us. Make of that what you will, but we are not here to discuss Professor Slughorn."

"Right... so, you want me to take the fifth-year class?"

"I do. The step up in difficulty will be good for you, as I said. If it turns out to be too difficult, we can always reverse course, though I doubt that will be an issue. What I am more interested in is seeing you work with... more advanced pupils."

That was when it struck Harry. Riddle was a fifth year, as was much of her entourage. He was being thrown into contact with Emily Riddle once again, and he knew by the expression on Professor Merrythought's face that this was every bit as inevitable as his much-needed extra lessons in Ancient Runes.

***October 2, 1942***

***The Potions Classroom***

***12:01 PM***

Harry was beginning to just expect to be summoned by professors after class at this point. Slughorn was fond of doing it in the best of times, but it had now happened two days in a row with two different professors. He had almost sighed aloud when the professor had glanced in his general direction. It was hardly surprising anymore. It felt much like the days during his classes with Lockhart back in second year. The man would always look at him with that pearly-white smile, bright as any snowfall, before calling him to the front of the room. Harry could always tell by his expression what was going to happen before it did. He was fonder of Slughorn than he ever had been of Lockhart, but nevertheless, the feeling was much the same. Though he did appreciate the fact it was just for a conversation.

Unless that conversation pertained to Emily Riddle. Harry thought to himself that he would rather re-enact the evils of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf a hundred times rather than be forced to spend more time with Riddle.

"Professor Merrythought talked to me yesterday," Harry started. He'd suspected that was what Slughorn was after. Sure enough, the man's eyes lit up like a roaring flame at the mention of Merrythought.

"Ah, did she now? And tell me, how did your little chat go?"

"I'm going to be taking fifth-year Defence Against the Dark Arts. Just like you planned."

Slughorn placed a hand on his heart and feigned a stagger, but he could not altogether hide the smile tugging at the corners of his pudgy lips. "Harry," he said, "how could you wound me so, m'boy?"

"It was really easy, sir. All I had to do was tell the truth."

Slughorn's mouth opened wide and out of it escaped a billowing roar that Harry recognized as the man's deep, booming laugh. It went on for so long that Harry feared for Slughorn. Breathing often seemed a task for the walrus-like man at the best of times. Indeed, he had devolved into a fit of wheezing and hiccuping by the time his laughter had subsided, but he warded off his troubles swiftly enough --- though he was still chortling like Dudley when he had seen something mildly inappropriate in his favourite cartoon.

"Oh, you are a clever one," Slughorn told him. "Were you playing me for a fool all along?"

Harry waited for him to go on but after a moment, it became clear it had not been a rhetorical question. "Pardon, sir?"

Slughorn wagged a finger. "Don't play coy with me, Harry. I've caught you out at last. All the acting, all the monologuing. You had this poor old man so convinced you were helpless and ignorant, yet you've known my game all along."

Professor Merrythought's words from the day before swam to the forefront of his mind, even as he waited for Slughorn to continue his thought.

*"I mean that Professor Slughorn exemplifies the traits your house is famous for and that he recognizes your potential more clearly than any of us. Make of that what you will..."*

"Here I was spreading the word of your talents far and wide," said Slughorn. "Here I was campaigning for you because I was sure you would never do it for yourself. Here I was expecting to sit you down and explain everything, but there's no need!" Slughorn leant forward and clasped Harry on the shoulder. If the man felt the muscles under his hand coil tight as any vice, he didn't show it.

"Sorry for stealing your thunder, sir," said Harry, who by this point had decided playing along was his wisest course of action.

Slughorn laughed yet again. "There's hope for you in the political arena still, I think. A true Slytherin you are. Between your perceptiveness and your talent mixed with my bag of connections, the sky really is the limit."

"I"m glad you think so, sir. Thanks for all the help."

"Of course, of course; think nothing of it. What good would all my hard-earned friendships be if I didn't put them to good use, eh?" The man's chins wobbled as he chortled. Harry did his best to force a smile despite the confusion that gripped him hard from the inside. He was slowly piecing together what had happened, but it wasn't coming as quickly as he would have liked.

"Speaking of friendships," said Slughorn, "I'm arranging another little gathering for the night of Samhain. It would be splendid if you'd join us again. There will be all sorts of people there and I'm sure they will all be very pleased to meet you."

Dread solidified in Harry's chest. It felt like his blood had been frozen solid and blocked the pathway to his lungs. His breath seemed to catch for a moment as he remembered the last meeting. It had resulted in him being stuck with Riddle for tutoring in Ancient Runes --- something that was set to begin that very night. Harry feared to imagine what could come of the second meeting, especially since Slughorn was doing a great job of making it sound as though it would be considerably larger than the first.

It also didn't help that this one would be taking place on the final day of October. Harry's luck had never been anything but comically awful on that day. His parents' death, the run-in with the troll, the opening of the Chamber of Secrets, and what he had then viewed as Sirius Black making an attempt on his life --- all of these things had happened on October's most auspicious evening. Harry had never been terribly superstitious, but he did believe in patterns and this one was obvious.

Yet how was he to decline? Perhaps if it had been any other professor, but Slughorn had forged him an identity. The man was the only reason Harry was at Hogwarts at all; turning him down just seemed wrong.

"Of course, Professor."

"Excellent!" said Slughorn, removing his hand from Harry's shoulder at last and rubbing it furiously against his other.

He looked like a child in that moment, Harry thought. Like Dudley yet again. Dudley on the morning of his birthday, rubbing his hands together and practically drooling at the heap of presents waiting for him on the Dursleys' dining room table.

Harry himself felt none of that excitement as he left the room. Anxiety and dread clashed with one another inside of him. It was like they had drawn weapons and were fighting fiercely for every inch of ground. Harry swore he could hear the song of steel clashing against steel as the emotions battled for supremacy within him.

Neither of them won the battle. Something pale reached for Harry from out of the shadows before one emotion could conquer the other and suddenly, adrenaline replaced all else as Harry jumped backwards and drew his wand as swiftly as he could.

"Relax, Pavonis. If I wanted to curse you, I'd have done it while you weren't paying attention."

It took Harry a moment to recognize the figure. She was standing at the mouth of a secret passage Harry knew only because of the Marauder's Map. Shadows stretched from behind her. She seemed to stand in a pool of them as their darkness surrounded her like some sort of horrid black fog. Her face became more visible when she leant forward and Harry's adrenaline vanished all at once as a different feeling altogether rose up within him.

"Black?"

Dorea Black would have been among the last people he would have expected to ambush him in the dungeons, but it was definitely her. The visage of the woman who had been his grandmother in his reality was not one he was likely to forget. He had seen her in dreams often enough, always staring longingly out at him from behind the oppressive glass of that damned mirror.

The first time he had seen her, Harry had been something akin to shell-shocked. It had happened the first number of times he had seen anyone who resembled Sirius, but those days had thankfully passed. It was merciful that they had, for there were a number of Blacks at Hogwarts and Harry encountered them more often than not. What, with Dorea being his partner in Potions and everyone in her family being a Slytherin? It was impossible to not cross paths with at least one of them each day.

Dorea gestured for Harry to go ahead of her into the passage she had just appeared from. Apprehension dominated his psyche as Harry stared around the corridor. No one seemed to be in their vicinity but there was something about Dorea's demeanour that was different. She was tenser than Harry had ever seen her and her dark eyes were darting this way and that as though she was surrounded despite the emptiness of the halls.

"Black, what is this---"

"It won't take long; I just don't want to be overheard."

Harry looked at her and finally, Dorea stared back and allowed her eyes to stop bouncing from this place to that. Harry was no legilimens, but Dorea did not look like she had any desire to deceive him. His fingers clung tightly to his wand as he stepped around her into the tunnel she had emerged from. No curse came and no trap was sprung, but it somehow made Harry even more anxious.

"What do you want?" he asked.

"A few things, but let's start with something simple for today. I wanted to warn you."

Harry's eyes narrowed. "Warn me about what?"

"Riddle."

Why was everything always about Riddle? It infuriated him. No matter what he did, he could not seem to escape her. The girl's presence was oppressive; it loomed over Hogwarts like a bank of dark and wrathful storm clouds. No matter which way Harry turned, it seemed to impede him. The harder he tried to escape, the louder the thunder seemed to boom as it followed him and the closer the lightning strikes came.

"What about her?"

"You're no idiot. Surely you realize that she seems interested in you."

"A lot of people seem interested in me. So what?"

"So I'm here to warn you that's not the person you want interested in you. Especially now that I've heard she'll be tutoring you."

"That wasn't my choice."

"Good. You're already smarter than most people in this castle, then."

"What exactly does that mean?"

"Surely you've noticed how everyone hangs off of her? How the boys follow her around like lost dogs begging for scraps. All she has to do is give them attention every now and then. A light touch here, a brush of the hands there, sweet words everywhere." Dorea scowled and Harry almost drew back. He had never seen an expression like that on her face.

"You don't like her?"

"I don't know her --- I just hate what she's done to the school. The girls are no better than the boys. It's her words that get them. Watch out for them. She'll talk to you like you're friends. She'll probably try and learn everything about you that she can. She'll even help you with everything you need. I have no doubt she'll be an incredible tutor in any subject, but it's all an act."

"I know."

Dorea looked at him with a sharp expression. "Do you?"

Harry thought he knew better than she could ever imagine, but a small part of him still wondered and he hated it. It wondered about the changes in the world as he remembered the way Riddle had taught him Homenum Revelio.

But now Dorea was confirming all of his worst fears just hours before he was set to meet Riddle again and somehow, he was now feeling even worse off about their impending encounter.

***Later that night...***

Going over Ancient Runes with Emily Riddle was strange. Harry had been about as stiff as any of the castle's resident suits of armour when he had entered the room, but it was... astonishingly productive. He almost forgot who it was giving him advice on the subject. Riddle spoke with a passionate intensity that pulled Harry in. She had a gift for metaphors and explaining complex topics through simplified examples. It made things a great deal easier and Harry found himself more interested in Ancient Runes than he had ever been.

He actually felt as though he had a grasp on the first few weeks of the third-year curriculum by the time they were finished. It was still miles behind where he ought to have been, but it was a noticeable improvement.

"You learn quickly," praised Riddle. "It's clearly not your best subject, but you listen well and seem quite sharp."

*"It's her words that get them. Watch out for them. She'll talk to you like you're friends."*

"Thanks. It's not a strong subject for me, so I'm just hoping to pass it."

"You ought to aim higher. Passing subjects is not enough for one like you."

"People like me?"

"Anyone with the capability to cast the Patronus Charm at your age should settle for nothing short of the best."

"This isn't Charms or Defence Against the Dark Arts," Harry countered.

"And why exactly does that matter?"

"Because in those classes, it's simple. Well, the practical bits are, anyway. You wave your wand, visualize correctly, and will things to happen. Runes is different. You need to understand it. It's more about the theory; the magic is just kind of there in the background."

"Which is the beauty of the subject."

Harry frowned. She had gotten him and he knew it. He had tried to shrug her compliments aside, but he had been dragged into this conversation and she had him. The lure was far too enticing. Whatever faults Riddle might have, a lack of knowledge was not one of them. Listening to her talk about magic was as interesting as it was informative.

"What do you mean?" Harry asked, taking the plunge with a blank expression and a great deal of apprehension.

"Not anybody can make masterpieces with the wave of a wand. It takes practice, but it's more than that. There is a natural affinity some have for magic. Without it, you can only ever get so far."

"Affinity?" asked Harry. "Like... some people are more powerful?"

"Power is a poor word for it. What is power? How does one quantify power? What does power even mean?" She looked at Harry expectantly, but he just shook his head. How on earth was he supposed to have an answer for something like that? "It's so much more complicated. Some take to magic like fish to water. It flows through them more readily. They cast it more efficiently, but there is subtlety to it."

"Subtlety, how?"

"There is a certain nuance. Masters don't need to slave away over spells for hours in the dead of night. Magic is intuitive. They grasp it quickly and to a degree higher than most could ever hope to match. It is what separates the greatest from the rest."

Harry had never heard of this before. None of his professors had ever spoken about what made a good witch or wizard. Just how to do the spells they were teaching. This could have been nonsense.

The Riddle from his time had supported a group who believed blood was what separated the elite from the rest of the pack, but this sounded... viable. Harry had seen people like Eloise Midgeon spend hours in the common room trying to cast spells to no avail. Even Hermione had had troubles from time to time despite her brilliance. Any time Harry had truly dedicated himself to a spell, he had mastered it.

Was this what Riddle was talking about? Was this what had separated Dumbledore and Voldemort from the rest of the world in Harry's time? Was it what separated Riddle even now as he sat before her?

"That's... interesting," Harry admitted, "but what does it have to do with Ancient Runes?"

"It represents a contrast."

"Come again?"

"You don't need this flare or affinity to master Ancient Runes. One can be untalented in magic but be the foremost expert on Ancient Runes our world has to offer. The only limitation in the subject is one's commitment. Any deficiencies in the subject are entirely self-inflicted." She smiled softly. "Except in cases like yours, of course. It's hardly your fault that you were never properly educated, but that will fix itself in time."

This sounded so unlike what Harry imagined Voldemort would sound like. Disregarding the praise that was surely meant to disarm him, Riddle spoke of Runes with admiration. That didn't surprise Harry. One surely did not get as powerful as Voldemort without astonishing levels of commitment, affinities or not.

Yet all Harry knew of the man made it seem as though Voldemort had revelled in his power. Surely he would hold anything in which he did not have an advantage in great disdain? But Riddle seemed to enjoy the fact. It even seemed to be her favourite thing about the subject.

Harry opened his mouth but realized he had nothing to say. Colour surged into his cheeks and he looked away to hide his blush. Riddle was surely about to respond, but a horrible sound drew the pair's attention before her lips had fully parted. A high, blood-curdling scream that Harry thought ought to have shattered the windows behind Riddle.

He winced and raised a hand to his ear as he drew his wand with the other. Riddle was on her feet before he had begun to rise from his chair. Her wand was already in her hand. That was odd, actually. He had been distracted, but Harry was quite observant and he certainly hadn't seen her draw the wand. As far as he could remember, he hadn't even seen her move her wrist.

She marched swiftly out the door without so much as a backwards glance, but Harry tailed her. Magic brushed against him; he recognized the touch --- it was the Homenum Revelio Charm she had taught him. If she minded him following, she said nothing, so he continued in her wake. They marched down a corridor and through a hidden passage Harry had never used before.

Then they were back out in a crowded hallway, but it didn't feel nearly as crowded as it really was. Half the crowd seemed to be heading in the same direction as Harry and Riddle --- towards whoever was wailing so horribly. The other half of the crowd was rushing in the opposite direction. Some of them were screaming just as horribly as the one that had first startled Harry and Riddle.

Yet despite all the commotion, Harry never found his path impeded as he followed Riddle through the hall. It was like the crowds parted before her, but that seemed ridiculous. Stress had an odd way of warping one's perception, Harry knew. He would later decide he had made the bit about parting crowds up, but he had more pressing thoughts in the moment, especially when they drew near to the front of the crowd.

A girl was curled into a ball just outside the nearest bathroom and there was a wall of students in front of her. They served as a buffer between the girl and... the thing that was trying to get at her. It was the size of a mastiff, black as night, and had eight legs.

Harry's eyes widened. It couldn't be... not in Hogwarts. The only time he had ever seen these creatures were in the Forbidden Forest and the colony's master had belonged to...

Oh... shit!

Hagrid! Hagrid was at Hogwarts; he had not yet been expelled for opening the Chamber of Secrets.

Which also meant...

"Hell," muttered Riddle, sounding surprised for the first time since Harry had met her. "An acromantula."

The students trying to defend the helpless girl were losing ground. Their spells glanced off the monster or did little to deter it. It was snapping more fiercely than ever. Aragog might have been much smaller than Harry remembered, but he was every bit as malicious.

Riddle pushed past a tall boy in front of her and brandished her wand. Something behind the crowd seemed to groan. There was a horrible, high creaking sound that even made the mammoth spider turn its head, but by then, it was too late.

Screams tore through the corridor once again, but this time, they heralded something very different.

A suit of armour charged noisily through the masses, shoving any who impeded aside as it barreled towards the spider, brandishing its sword and shield. Every single one of the spider's beady eyes went wide as saucers. Then it let out a horrible, high-pitched protest as a purple spell fired from Riddle's wand penetrated its hide. Blood streamed from a gash in its side, as eerie as the blue-grey sky at dusk as it dripped down and stained the ancient stone floor. The monster retreated then, unable to bear Riddle's assault and unwilling to face the warrior drawing near. The suit of armour pursued Aragog, but he scuttled faster and Harry instinctively knew that it would never catch him.

Riddle seemed completely unconcerned. She had already surged forward once again, but this time, she knelt over the fallen girl whose robes were stained by a coppery-smelling substance that left deep stains against her robes.

Harry thought there was something strangely familiar about the girl as he drew close. A harsh array of pimples spread across the girl's face and her tear-filled eyes were obscured by obnoxiously thick glasses. Harry knew from his time wearing ill-fitting lenses with the Dursleys that the ones this girl wore must have been completely impractical.

"What exactly is going on here?"

Harry jumped at the voice and so did Riddle. She had been bent over the other girl just a moment ago, but at the sound of the voice, her head snapped up like somebody had fired off a Blasting Curse behind her. Harry knew the voice without needing to look, but he glanced over his shoulder nonetheless.

Albus Dumbledore was strolling towards them. His robes billowed around him as though caught in a sudden wind and Harry fought the urge to shiver as he drew near. It was like the very air around him was charged with electricity that made his hairs stand on end. Dumbledore's auburn hair shone in the light of many torches.

He first looked to Riddle, then Harry, but then his attention fell solely upon the girl still sprawled and sobbing upon the blood-soaked floor.

"Miss Warren," Dumbledore whispered. "Myrtle, please look at me. Whatever ailed you has passed and I need your attention. Everything is going to be alright, I promise. Can you stand? Are you hurt?"

Harry heard the words, but his brain did not process them.

Well... it had been processing until the name reached his ears.

Myrtle... MOANING MYRTLE!

Two thoughts connected inside Harry's mind and triggered a third so horrible that he gasped aloud.

Moaning Myrtle was alive and at Hogwarts and Hagrid's monster had been born and was now on the loose.

Which meant one thing...

If this reality mirrored his own, then very, very soon, the Chamber of Secrets would be open once more.

***The Second Floor, Hogwarts***

***8:41 PM***

Harry felt as though someone had taken a blazing rod of iron and struck him across the face with it. Heat engulfed him as the revelation crashed into him like towering waves, the emotions washing over him like a torrential downpour.

In all the thoughts of far-distant futures, he had almost forgotten about the Chamber of Secrets. It had crossed his mind long ago, but the prospect of it opening had been lost under the weight of everything else he was dealing with. He glanced at Riddle now. She was watching Myrtle and Dumbledore and seemed to be paying him no mind.

*"Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think Hagrid was innocent. He persuaded Dippet to keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed... Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did..."*

Harry found himself thinking of that conversation down in the Chamber of Secrets more often than he would like. It was the only real experience he had shared with Riddle. Well, even that might not be right. It was the closest he had come to interacting with the incarnation of Riddle he now so often dealt with.

But this piece could be telling. It was difficult to do anything without knowing how different Emily was from Tom. What if he acted rashly and she was never to become Voldemort? What if she won him over and then became even worse? Dumbledore was a man he trusted; he ought to know better than just about anybody what they were all dealing with in the form of Emily Riddle. If Dumbledore seemed wary, Harry should follow his example. If he doted on Riddle like all the rest, perhaps there was hope for her yet.

Myrtle was trying to stand now, but it seemed her efforts would be to no avail. She was trembling more violently than Harry had ever seen anyone shake before. Spasms seemed to run up her body from the force with which it shook. Tears had stained her swollen face and smears of blood were splattered on her robes. It would have looked like a child had been experimenting with crimson finger paint if not for the fact her robes had been torn through just above the right side of her ribs.

Harry remembered the massive spiders from the Forbidden Forest in his second year. The sounds of their pincers had made his skin crawl and he could hardly imagine the damage they could do if unleashed. Myrtle was fortunate that Aragog was in his infancy and that he had been stopped. If he was older or if the attack had gone longer, there would have been more dire repercussions. Despite the blood, tears, and terror, the girl seemed relatively unharmed.

Yet the sight of her still stirred something within Harry that made him tremble. His skin crawled, just like it had that night the spiders had taken him and Ron to their den of horrors, and his stomach seemed to tie itself in knots at the sight of Myrtle. Perhaps it was because he knew that, if nothing changed, she could be dead by the year's end; or perhaps it was because he had seen what she was to become if that took place. The most miserable incarnation of death one could ever imagine. Her very existence had been depressing; seeing her trend in that general direction was almost sickening.

"Charlus," called Dumbledore, "take her to the hospital wing, if you would."

Harry's heart stopped as the boy stepped forward.

Merlin, it was like looking in a mirror but for the eyes. Charlus was taller than he suspected he would ever be and more muscular, but much was the same. He wore glasses just like Harry once had and his hair was black as night and about as tidy as an angry child's nursery. His cheekbones were similar, as was his nose. Harry thought he himself had a softer jaw, and Charlus's eyes were hazel instead of the vivid green that greeted Harry every time he looked in a mirror, but the similarities were striking. He wondered for a moment whether this was what everyone felt when they looked at him whilst at Hogwarts and compared him to his father in his previous reality.

For Harry, that was only a small part of it. Seeing Dorea was jarring, but Charlus was another thing altogether. The striking similarities only drove the point home that Harry was looking at his grandfather. With Dorea, he could almost forget sometimes as they leant over potions and worked together on their brew. There was nothing to distract him from the reality that was Charlus.

"Of course, sir."

Even his voice sounded like James's. Harry was almost grateful for the boy's absence when he rounded the corner, half-carrying Myrtle along with him. Harry forced himself to pull his attention away from Charlus. It seemed as though Riddle had finally taken her eyes off of Dumbledore. She was watching him very closely and there was a quiet intensity about her stare that put Harry ill at ease.

"Miss Riddle," said Dumbledore, pulling the girl's stare back onto him as though his words had activated a great magnet. "What is it that happened here?"

"Some kind of attack, Professor. I'm not exactly sure why or how --- I only arrived after it had begun."

"What exactly attacked her? It appears to me like some sort of magical beast."

"An acromantula, sir."

Dumbledore's expression did not waver, but Harry thought he felt the man's intensity mount. "You are certain of this?"

"I am. They're difficult to miss and quite distinctive."

Students were trying to push towards the three of them --- Harry, Riddle, and Dumbledore --- but they were unsuccessful. Much of the crowd was muttering obliviously and unintentionally obstructing the path of the more observant and curious onlookers.

"How exactly do you imagine the monster entered the castle?"

"I have no idea, Professor. All I can do is tell you what I saw."

"And what of the beast? I am sure you saw what became of it?"

This was unlike Dumbledore, Harry thought. In his time, the man had been renowned for his kindliness and his patience. He was polite even now, but he was pressing Riddle with more fervour than Harry might have expected. All the fact did was cause his suspicions to rise and his unease to swell.

"It retreated. Some of the students and I did our best to force it away."

"How did you accomplish this?" You --- Dumbledore had chosen that word very deliberately. Harry was sure of that; he knew that not many of the students were capable of driving back a monster such as Aragog.

"I animated one of the suits of armour."

"An impressive feat; very noble." Dumbledore turned to look properly at Harry for the first time. "And what of you, Master Pavonis? Did you see anything Miss Riddle did not?"

"No, sir. We came at the same time."

Damnit! He shouldn't have said that. Dumbledore's entire demeanour changed with the admission. He seemed tenser, more rigid, and his stare was more penetrating than ever before.

"I see," he said, turning back to Emily. "I think you had best corral your housemates and lead them back to the common room. It would do them no good to lurk in the corridors with such a monstrosity on the loose."

"Of course, sir," said Riddle, startling Harry by resting a hand on his shoulder. He thought he saw a smile trying to form on her lips, but he could not for the life of him tell why; especially not with his heart suddenly threatening to beat out of his chest as beads of sweat formed all around his once-famous scar.

***October 5, 1942***

***The Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom***

***1:15 PM***

Rumours and theories tore through the school like a wildfire through a dry forest as the following days passed. Not many seemed to recognize the monster for what it really was. Some of the muttered conspiracies the younger years came up with were really quite something. Not that Harry begrudged them. Coming up with outlandish theories was a surprisingly good way of decompressing and standing firm against the forces of dread and despair. It wasn't as though he and his friends had not come up with all sorts of ridiculous things during their three years at Hogwarts. The days of thinking Draco Malfoy was the Heir of Slytherin really weren't that far gone, in the grand scheme of things.

Elena had all sorts of questions for Harry that night. She seemed unable to decide whether she was more interested in the attack or in his lesson with Riddle. Harry did his best to answer both, but he didn't have all that much to say about either. The lesson had been uneventful if not productive, other than their admittedly fascinating conversation after it had concluded. The attack really was just what Riddle had said to Dumbledore. Harry had no tidbits of note to offer Elena.

Well, none he could share. He could, of course, tell her all kinds of things about Aragog, Hagrid, Riddle, and even the Chamber of Secrets, but he wasn't sure he would ever trust Elena *that* deeply. Ron and Hermione might have been told such secrets, but they had been through so much together. Harry liked Elena immensely --- he even preferred her in some ways --- but there was a certain kind of trust that is only earned via enduring adversity and strife together. Elena just had not reached that point yet. Remembering all the golden trio had needed to go through together before Ron and Hermione had earned that sort of trust... Harry hoped Elena would never reach that point with him.

It was strange to part ways with her after lunch on Monday. She was heading back to the common room for her spare period whilst he was off for his first Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson with the fifth-year Slytherins.

His heartbeat seemed to quicken with every step he took. The nearer he drew to the classroom, the louder the sound of pumping blood became in his ears.

A part of him was very much looking forward to this class now. Merrythought had been right about one thing --- the fourth-year curriculum really hadn't been challenging him. Harry had been quite good at Defence before he was thrust fifty years in the past, but the time he had put into the subject since that shift had launched him miles ahead. Perhaps the fifth-year version of the class would provide him with more stimulating challenges. He would surely learn new things, which was more than he could say for all of his previous lessons this year --- minus the one covering the three Unforgivable Curses.

That was all well and good, but Harry had come to the realization some time ago that he would now actually be sharing a class with Riddle. It was one thing to be in a house with her and another altogether to be tutored by her, but actually sharing a classroom with her would surpass both of those things in all sorts of unpleasant ways.

Harry had a hard time not staring at her as he joined the queue outside of the classroom. Many of the fifth years shot him veiled glances, but he paid them no mind. He just looked at the door and waited. If Professor Merrythought had not yet informed them of his ascension, that was not his problem. He had better things to do than dignify each pompous student with an explanation or even a glance.

The door to the classroom opened precisely one minute before class was meant to start. Harry could feel the stares on his back intensify as he walked in the door, but Merrythought made no comment, so his new classmates also held their tongues.

"Pavonis," called Merrythought, "to the front, please." Harry moved automatically before realizing what Merrythought had planned. "Take a seat here, beside Miss Riddle. She'll make sure you're up to speed in case there are any gaps in your knowledge and I think the dynamic will be good for both of you."

That was all the professor said on the matter. She turned to the rest of the class and began organizing things as the bell's tolling drew nearer and nearer.

"I must admit, I can't say I expected to see you here."

Harry almost leapt from his chair. Riddle had leant in close without him even noticing. Her voice was soft and quiet, but it was right next to his ear. Her warm breath tickled his skin and he felt goosebumps rise all over.

"Surprised?" he asked in a choppy voice after a pause to recover.

"Pleasantly, yes," said Riddle, a small smile adorning her features as the bell rang to signify the beginning of class.

Her demeanour shifted as soon as it did. Her posture straightened, her hands fell into her lap and folded neatly together, and her attention focused immediately upon the front of the class as Merrythought marched to stand before her desk and address the class as a whole.

"I think it best to start this class by addressing the elephant in the room," said the professor, "we have a new student joining us today." Harry could hear people shifting all about the room to look at him better now that they had been given an excuse to do just that. He did his best to continue staring at Professor Merrythought and nothing else. "Master Pavonis is an extremely talented fourth year capable of casting spells far beyond NEWT-level expectations. Certain members of the staff have deemed him capable of learning alongside all of you. I will expect this decision to be respected and will be very displeased if his presence in this classroom causes any needless disruptions. Am I understood?"

Harry didn't need to look behind him to know that the class was nodding. Merrythought seemed satisfied, but Harry was far from being at ease. He could feel a small amount of tension lingering in the room and he knew that a majority of this crowd were likely wrapped around Riddle's finger as they ate out of the palm of her hand.

"Excellent. Now, we will move on with the curriculum and begin today with something that I promised a month ago." Harry felt more than saw Riddle perk up beside him. She had been politely attentive before, but now, he could tell she was legitimately interested.

"Duelling?" asked a pale boy with a twisted face. Harry thought his name was Dolohov, but he wasn't certain.

"Precisely," said Merrythought. Harry's heart quickened once more. It had only just slowed down, but the mention of duelling had him all worked up once more.

He had surprisingly little experience with duelling considering all he had done. There had, of course, been the one and only gathering of the Hogwarts Duelling Club back in his second year. What had transpired with Sirius in the Shrieking Shack could hardly be considered a duel and it wasn't exactly like Harry had prevailed in his other adventures due to his skill with a wand. He had killed the basilisk by stabbing it with the sword of Godric Gryffindor, and it had been his mother's magical sacrifice that had killed Quirrell and re-vanquished Voldemort at the end of his first year. There had been Diagon Alley. Harry supposed he had done relatively well considering the lack of practice he'd had at the time. Well enough to earn Slughorn's support and attention, at the very least; but even then, he would likely have died if not for the Potion Master's intervention.

"There is war in the world," continued Merrythought. "We all hoped it would never arrive on our shores, but this summer proved otherwise. Some have doubted my ambitious choices regarding the curriculum, but I think rushing the lot of you is less harmful than allowing any of you to find yourself in a dangerous position whilst unprepared. Today, we take our first major step in ensuring that does not happen. Before I pair you all off, I think it's important that we understand what will and will not be accepted in this class."

Harry tuned out most of Merrythought's lecture. It was really quite obvious. Nothing that couldn't be healed without relatively low amounts of time and effort and nothing downright malicious. It was a wise warning. Harry could only imagine what Riddle could have done to whatever poor sod ended up partnering with her.

Oh, Merlin... Harry *really* hoped he wasn't *that* unlucky.

"Now," said Merrythought right on cue, "it's time to pair you all off."

Irma Crabbe was paired with Cassiopeia Black. Harry thought that one seemed a mismatch. He knew little about either of them other than the fact that Black hung around with Riddle. Yet, the Black family had a reputation and if Irma was anything like the Crabbe he had known, that one was going to end poorly.

Dolohov and Rosier seemed a more even pair, as did Alphard Black and Romulus Lestrange. Harry glanced at who was left and his heart rate quickened. Surely not... his luck couldn't be *that* bad, could it?

"Miss Riddle," said Merrythought, "with Miss Parkinson."

Oh, thank Merlin --- that was a duel Harry did not envy. Nor did Parkinson judging by her expression. She was a talented student from the little Harry knew about her, but she looked like she was going to be sick. Riddle's expression hadn't changed but for an encouraging smile she shot in the girl's general direction that only seemed to make her even more nervous.

"Pavonis, this leaves you with Mulciber." Mulciber was tall and thick-set with sharp features and dark black hair and eyes. The look he was giving Harry was anything but pleasant, but the former Boy-Who-Lived did his best to ignore the stare. "Why don't you two go first?"

The question caught Harry off guard. Words seemed to tumble too quickly from his mouth. Instead of landing on his tongue and escaping as coherent sounds, they seemed to bypass that bit altogether by tumbling straight out of his open mouth and onto the floor without a sound.

Not that it mattered. Mulciber was on his feet and ready in a second. Harry had a sneaking suspicion that Merrythought had never been asking in the first place. This was very blatantly her way of testing Harry --- to find out once and for all whether he really did belong.

The duel opened viciously. Mulciber led with a Cutting Curse that Harry dodged and a Bludgeoner that he shielded. The spell slammed hard into his shield and Harry felt its shock. Mulciber had power in his spells; more so than Elena, certainly, but he was slow and sloppy. Harry dropped his shield but did not return fire. He allowed Mulciber to cast again and he saw the same thing he had the first time. His elbow flared out whenever he cast. It made it easy to pick out exactly where he was going to direct the spell. If he practiced more, Harry suspected he would even be able to gauge the spell selection before the boy incanted aloud based on his wand movements alone.

Harry stepped well out of the way of where Mulciber's next spell would be and fired off an Impediment Jinx, a Disarming Charm, a Stunner, and a Banishing Hex one after the other. Mulciber had to dive out of the way of the first. He was on his feet again and shielded against the second. The third caused his shield to fall and he tried to move out of the way, but the Banishing Hex caught him square in the chest and he was thrown bodily across the room. The sound of him slamming into the wall was sickening. It was like wood splintering into pieces; Harry had not held back on the Banishing Hex. Nobody could say the spell was too dangerous and if Merrythought wanted him to prove something at the expense of one of Riddle's lackeys, who was he to turn her down?

"That's enough, Pavonis," called the professor, but Harry was already stepping back, acutely aware of stares from those around him. He didn't care. That had been nothing impressive; it might have looked like it to an untrained eye, but Harry knew it had more to do with Mulciber than it did him. After duelling with Elena --- who was swift, sure-footed, and precise in each and every moment --- it had felt like Mulciber was moving through quicksand.

Many of the eyes gathered about the room continued watching Harry even as the other pairs went. Cassiopeia crushed Irma Crabbe in the next duel like Harry expected, but the following two were quite competitive. Romulus Lestrange beat a very game Alphard Black in an exchange that barely lasted several minutes before Felix Rosier lost to Antonin Dolohov in a duel that lasted at least ten. Harry was grateful for the latter contest because it drew enough attention that he felt as though he could breathe for the first time since wrapping up his own duel.

And then, Riddle was up against Parkinson.

It was clear within seconds that Parkinson had no chance. She fired spell after spell at Riddle, but the raven-haired girl just batted them aside with the casual ease one might use to swat a fly. She slowly advanced on Parkinson, who was beginning to grow panicked before finally Riddle finally struck.

Stone rose from the floor all around the poor girl. It spun around her like a mighty tornado and seemed poised to bury her alive at any moment or to simply smash her skull in. Then, Riddle let it all fall back to the floor as she let loose a torrent of magic faster than Harry had ever seen.

It should have been impossible. Spell after spell flew from her wand without a seconds' delay. One coloured spell bled into another. They weren't following each other; they were transitioning seamlessly --- it was like a flashing light show. Riddle had obviously used the stones to obstruct Parkinson's vision, but it had been unnecessary. Harry knew she would never have stood up to so much magic cast at once --- he doubted any of them would have.

The duel ended seconds later and Harry was feeling very conflicted as he left the classroom at the end of class. On one hand, nobody would be talking about him like he had feared. On the other, Emily Riddle was every bit as terrifying with a wand as he could ever have imagined. That could turn out to be extremely problematic if events unfolded in an unfavourable manner.

***October 11, 1942***

***The Second Floor***

***9:23 PM***

Harry had never quite realized how heavily he relied upon his invisibility cloak until he had left it in his prior reality and now had to function without it. He had become lax in the years of using it. All the good sneaking habits he had acquired on Privet Drive from late-night trips to the kitchen had been trained away by three years of laziness inspired by the fact he knew none could look upon him whilst he was cloaked.

It made sneaking around Hogwarts now even harder than it really ought to have been. He came to the top of the hidden passage and pressed his ear against the wall. Harry really needed to find a spell that boosted his hearing. He felt both blind and deaf without the Marauder's Map and really needed to make up for it. Merlin, did he wish he had never left those two items behind. Had he not, this trip might never have been necessary in the first place.

His wariness towards Riddle had been swelling all year, but it had really mounted ever since the night Dumbledore had pressed her so hard. Seeing her deadly aptitude with a wand not once, but twice had only made things all the worse. It wasn't enough that she might well be about to open the Chamber of Secrets in the coming months or even weeks, but she was also talented enough that, if she did, Harry was unsure he would be able to stop her. Adorned in green and silver robes, he thought it quite unlikely he would find himself wielding that ruby encrusted sword ever again.

Harry wished he hadn't seen Riddle since the day she had made Parkinson look like a first year practicing magic for the first time, but that was sadly not the case. They had collided only two days ago for their weekly lesson in Ancient Runes. This time, it had not been the aftermath of that lesson that left Harry reeling, but what came before.

***Two nights earlier...***

Harry tried not to glance to his right as he and Riddle walked through one of the dungeon corridors. He had done an admirable job of staying clear of her for the last four days, but that ended tonight via the evils of necessity. Whether Riddle sensed his unease and was politely being quiet or whether she simply had no interest in conversing with him, he didn't know, but he was grateful for her silence thus far.

"Ah! Harry, Emily! What a happy surprise! You two just so happened to be exactly who I was looking for!"

Harry had never been so unhappy to hear Slughorn's voice. Did the man have to have his fingers in everything Harry did? He wasn't ungrateful, but wasn't setting these lessons up in the first place cruel enough? Why did he have to torment him more? Harry would have been grateful if he thought there was a chance in hell that Slughorn might distract Riddle from the lesson or pull Harry away for something more important, but he knew the Chudley Cannons had a better chance of taking the title this year.

"Good evening, Professor," said Riddle. "How are you tonight?"

"I'm well, very well indeed."

"I'm glad to hear it, sir. Is there anything either of us can help you with?"

"Indirectly, I suppose." Harry thought he saw something flickering in Slughorn's eyes that he recognized. The man had worn a similar expression at the start of the dinner at which he had told Harry he would be staying with the Fawleys. Slughorn had something up his sleeve, and Harry somehow suspected he was not going to like it.

"I dislike speaking for others," said Riddle, "but I'm sure Harry would be just as happy as I'll be to do whatever you require of us, Professor."

She was infuriating. She made everything look so easy. She could have talked her own way out of a hostage situation or negotiated world peace. She was smoother than silk, her words flowing sweet and swift as golden honey.

"It's nothing to worry about, I assure you, but you're about the age now where it would be... appropriate to start attending my gatherings... accompanied."

The first emotion Harry had seen on Emily's visage that night flashed across her face, but it was gone faster than he could identify it. "What do you mean, sir?"

"Well... I'm sure you've noticed the interest you generate. If the right sort see you at such gatherings alone---"

"They'll think there is something about me that turns people away."

Slughorn shuffled from foot to foot. "Well, I didn't say---"

"It's okay, Professor. I'll make sure to attend your Samhain gathering with a suitable partner. You have my word."

Harry watched the walrus-like man sag in relief. "Thank you. I don't mean to impose, it's just---"

"I understand that you just want the best for your students. It's noble; there's no need to apologize."

"I knew you'd understand," said Slughorn, turning to Harry. "You too, m'boy. A bit younger. I wouldn't be seen doing anything too ambitious if I were you, but some company would send a good message."

"I'm... not sure I'm ready for that, sir."

Harry had expected that direction from the second Slughorn had pushed the narrative with Riddle and had prepared an answer before lying in wait.

"It would only be a formality. Nothing too serious."

"I just don't know who I would bring. I... don't know many girls yet, let alone who I'd..." he let his voice trail off.

"I would be happy to help form a compromise." Both Harry and Slughorn looked sharply towards Riddle for very different reasons. She looked at Harry. "I can help you find a suitable partner; it's really no trouble at all. You won't have to be the one to arrange anything this way, but it will still reflect well on you and Professor Slughorn."

"A marvellous idea!" Slughorn boomed. "Emily, you truly are something special. You'll go far; trust me on that."

Harry could feel the smugness in Riddle as she accepted the praise, but it was not the sensation that worried him, for he had the distinct and unpleasant suspicion that Riddle was planning something that involved him and the Samhain gathering.

***Back in the present...***

Harry thought it had been that night beyond all else that had kicked him into action. Riddle was planning something involving him the same night the Chamber of Secrets had been opened in his own reality. Perhaps that was a coincidence, but it was one Harry was not willing to chance. He had to know --- desperate times called for desperate measures and playing defence would only work for so long.

***A Secret Passage on the Fourth Floor***

***10:26 PM***

Emily looked around one of her favourite rooms in the castle and remembered the days not all that long ago when the room had been barren and devoid of all decor. It was a spacious room with no windows, lit entirely by flickering torches and nestled in a secret passageway behind a massive, floor-to-ceiling mirror on the fourth floor. It had been near the end of her third year when Emily had discovered this passage. Not until some time into her fourth had she decorated it the way she liked.

Comfortable armchairs formed a ring around a central fire; neither of which existed when the room had been rediscovered. Emily had debated a long, oak table or something more formal, but she preferred the current layout. It was less intimidating and carried less gravitas, but it reminded her of the Slytherin common room, perhaps her favourite place in the world. She thought that might change soon if her current pursuit yielded the results she was hoping for.

Her closest companions were gathered around: Cassiopeia, Antonin, Felix, Silas, Augustus, and the others. Dolohov's twisted face looked like a pale lantern in the darkness of the room, whilst a torch bracket nearby made Rosier's elegant hair look like a roaring golden fire.

"One last thing before we all go back," said Emily, allowing her gaze to shift to Mulciber, who had sat quietly for much of the meeting. "I don't want any retaliatory action taken against Pavonis."

"Why does it matter?" Mulciber snapped. "Why is he so important? He's just a no-name mudblood."

Emily felt a heat stir in her chest, but she allowed it to climb no further. "I don't care what you think of him nor what you call him. I care that you don't retaliate for your own incompetence."

Mulciber didn't reply this time. Her rebuke had been sharp and he knew better than to push her. Emily could sense that his words had stirred the others though, and she knew that they must share some of his skepticism.

There really was nothing remarkable about Hadrian Pavonis on the surface. No family name, no striking intellect, and no breathtaking charisma, but there certainly was something about him. Anyone who could cast a Patronus Charm at the age of fourteen had more going on than what met the eye. He also clearly had the favour of Slughorn in a way she wasn't even sure she ever had. He must, for even she had not been pushed ahead a year in Defence Against the Dark Arts and he was no match for her. She knew that just from observing him. What exactly he had done to curry so much favour with their Head of House, she would learn eventually.

His ability was only a small part of it though, as was the regard Slughorn held for him. There was something very different about him. Pavonis seemed about the only boy within a few years of her age in the castle to not be caught in her orbit and pulled towards her waiting snares. For all the time they spent alone, he seemed fidgety and on guard, almost like he knew things the others didn't. He could not, of course. He knew nothing about her and she knew that once the effort had been put in, he would dance to her tunes just like everyone else, but for now, he was an enigma.

Yet... someone had been lurking about the second floor. A very specific part of the second floor; the same part she had narrowed in on. The same part she was sure housed what she had been looking for for the better part of the last year.

She had first thought that perhaps it was a coincidence. It was hardly out of the question. Yet in all the time that had passed since she had narrowed down her search, never had she found such consistent signs of lurking in that area of the castle. There really was no reason to. The only thing of note nearby was that blasted bathroom that so often spewed water all across the corridor. It had been out-of-order ever since Emily had arrived at Hogwarts and long before. *Hogwarts, A History* stated that it had been that way for roughly two hundred years.

Yet every time she had explored those hallways as of late, there had been signs of another doing the same thing. She could not tell who, but she knew someone had been there. A phenomenon that had only started after she had begun spending more time with Pavonis --- the only person in the entire school other than the damned Transfiguration Professor who seemed at all wary of her.

It was all too convenient to be anything other than connected. The question was how. He could not possibly know what she was planning --- that was impossible --- but he knew, or suspected, something. No other explanation could rationalize his strange, anomalous behaviour.

"I think it's about time we begin heading back," she told the assembled students. "Cassie, would you mind staying back to help me with something?"

"Of course not." Emily did not need Legilimency nor even her eyes to know exactly how pleased the request made the young Black. Smugness practically exuded from her along with the obvious satisfaction that hung in her voice.

The others seemed less satisfied about leaving and some of them still glanced her way as they departed when they thought she wasn't looking. *Let them stare,* she thought, *and let them all talk, too.* The more worked up about the Pavonis situation they all became, the more they would question her. That may have sounded like something unfavourable, but it meant she was unpredictable. Routines inspired confidence --- she had learned by now that keeping all of them on their toes was the most effective way of ensuring the dynamic she most desired stayed firmly in place.

"You wanted my help with something?" Cassie asked once everyone had left the room.

Her voice sounded formal and prepared to take orders. It was hardly a surprise. Wanting help with something was usually a polite way of putting an order, but Emily also did not miss the traces of hope behind all of that. That was good; genuine emotion usually inspired stronger motivation, though she knew Cassie would be most displeased by this particular request.

"I did, yes. You know, there was a reason I asked for the rest of them to avoid making trouble with Pavonis."

"The Patronus Charm?"

"No, I care very little about his magical ability."

"I didn't mean you were afraid of him. I know that you're the better magician and have no reason to be wary of him. I just thought... it might have caught your interest."

It was a hasty save, but Cassie was closer to being right than she had any right to be. "It did, but it has nothing to do with tonight. There is something different about Pavonis. Not knowing what that thing is vexes me."

"Is this about me and what you want help with?"

"It is."

"I'm... not sure what I could do to change that."

"I don't expect you to change that. You're more than welcome to do so anyway if the opportunity presents itself, but I'm not terribly optimistic."

There was suspicion in Cassie's narrowed eyes. "What do you want me to do, then?"

Emily smiled thinly. "Distract an observant boy with an air of suspecting far too much."

***October 16, 1942***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***9:14 PM***

"I've arranged your companion for the Slug Club gathering on Samhain."

Harry had been in the middle of standing from his chair to leave his most recent lesson in Runes with Riddle, but he about fell back into it when she so casually threw that at him.

"You have?"

If truth was to be told, Harry had mostly forgotten about the Samhain gathering. He had been far more worried about the possibility of Riddle trying to open the Chamber of Secrets, petrifying a host of students, and killing Myrtle Warren.

"I have, yes. I did say I would." There was something different about the curve of her smile this time. It seemed almost mischievous. "Surely you didn't think I wouldn't keep my word?"

"I-I didn't mean that."

"Good. I would have been offended if you had. All the work I've put into being kind and upstanding just for such a slight."

This was a side of Riddle he had never seen before. Brilliant, charming, and charismatic were all things he had seen. This was an extension of the latter, but it was different. She was talking to him as if they were old friends who had known each other for years. The ease with which she spoke indicated a level of confidence and familiarity that Harry did not possess with anyone who wasn't named Elena.

"I..." he spluttered and blushed, trying and failing to think of something to say.

Riddle laughed lightly. "Loosen up, Harry. You are allowed to quip back. It's hardly as though I'm going to curse you for it."

He actually thought the possibility of being cursed for saying the wrong thing around Riddle was quite high. Maybe not as much for him as her followers. She had not cowed him into submission; he was sure she knew that if she cursed him, she couldn't be certain he wouldn't go off to a professor or try and retaliate in his own way.

"Whatever," he said, "who have you arranged, then?"

"Cassiopeia. She's a friend of mine that you met on the train. Lovely girl, but I don't think you've spoken with her much since that first day."

"I haven't, no." Harry had not spoken with her at all, actually. He tried to speak as little with the Blacks as possible, sans Dorea. They all still reminded him of Sirius and he knew that many of them were involved with Riddle and some of the most evil facets of magic.

"Good. It will be nice for the two of you to become properly acquainted. I'm sure that Professor Slughorn has told you so, but connections really are important. Cassiopeia is a great one to have given her family background."

"I... suppose so." Harry had no idea how he was supposed to react. Riddle setting him up with one of her friends was really to be expected, but that was not what bothered him. He was far more concerned with the altogether more pressing question of why she had cared who attended him to the gathering in the first place.

She laughed lightly once more. "Give the night some thought. It would be a shame if you were so tongue-tied when the occasion finally came."

Harry just nodded as he left. It was easier --- Riddle had an infuriating talent of leaving him baffled and grasping for words; whether it was because of something she had done or something she might do in the future.

***October 22, 1942***

***The Dungeons***

***8:11 AM***

Harry's stomach rumbled as he and Elena stepped out of the Slytherin common room that Thursday morning. It seemed as though he had been rising earlier and earlier with every day that passed. The closer it got to Samhain, the more restless his body had become and the less willing it was to stay asleep.

Dawn had not yet broken when he had retreated to the library that morning. Elena had barely been awake by the time Harry returned to the common room and she rose much earlier than the average person.

"You're sure you're all right?" she asked him. "You've seemed a bit off lately."

Well, the prospect of attending a ball with a potentially dangerous member of Riddle's inner circle who he didn't know probably did have that effect on him. Not to mention his dread over what might happen if Riddle tried to open the Chamber of Secrets. Then, there was just Samhain in general. The death of his parents, the fight with the troll, the attack on Mrs. Norris, and Sirius breaking into the castle. Samhain was never anything but eventful, and usually not in any way that was at all favourable for Harry.

Yet how could he tell Elena any of that? It vexed him to think about how often that thought arose. So often he had to lie to her because he would never be able to tell her the truth. It was painful. Not being able to be honest with his one true friend crumpled up his gut like a discarded wrapper. Every fold felt like an iron-clad blow and it was happening more and more often as the year slowly passed.

"Yeah. I always used to wake up early. This is really just me getting back on schedule."

It was so much more than his sleep and the both of them knew it, but Elena was too tactful to say so. Harry also knew that and was more than happy to have escaped the day's unpleasant conversation.

"Harry, m'boy."

Or, perhaps not.

Professor Slughorn had just stepped around a corner. His eyes were heavy with the signs of weariness and it could not be any clearer that the man had just rolled out of bed. He was incredibly alert considering how frazzled he still looked. Not that it was surprising to Harry. The man always looked rather alert when the two of them were in a room together.

"Good morning, Professor."

"A good morning indeed, though I could do with a bit more sleep. No rest for the weary though, I suppose." The man chuckled and hid a yawn behind his hand. "How have you been, Harry? Are your sessions with Emily going well?"

Harry could feel Elena tense beside him, but he did not spare her so much as a glance. "They have, sir. My grades in Runes have actually been getting a lot better." That part was actually true. Professor Anderson had been quite impressed as of late. The grades were still abysmal, but the improvements were astonishing.

"Excellent, excellent! I'm sure she's wonderful to work with. Brilliant mind, brilliant indeed. Must be a splendid teacher."

"She's been great, sir." Annoyingly, even that was true --- minus the setting him up with a dangerous female he didn't know bit.

"I'm so glad, Harry." The man chuckled once more as amusement danced in his dark, beady eyes. "While we're on the topic of splendid women, have you arranged a companion for Samhain yet?"

Harry saw Elena's head whip around from the corner of his eye. Oh, Merlin. What was he to tell her? That Riddle had outplayed him? That would only make her paranoid. That he had been too afraid to ask her? That would only make him look stupid and make her think that there was more to their friendship than there really was. There was no good way out of this, he decided, so he would just have to deal with it as it came.

"Yes, sir. I'm going with Cassiopeia Black."

Harry expected to see a look of pride on Slughorn's face. A pleased expression or a booming laugh and snide remark, at least. What he did not expect was what he saw. A flicker of something in the man's eyes that Harry did not recognize for a moment, but that he puzzled out after a slight pause. It was the same expression Mrs. Weasley had worn the morning Harry arrived at the Burrow with her sons via flying Ford Anglia. The same expression Harry had seen Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon hiding from Dudley whenever he arrived home with an especially dismal grade.

Disappointment.

But why? Cassiopeia was better than Harry should have been able to hope for. A talented and clever witch born to what was probably the most prestigious family in the nation. She was a year older than him, had endless connections, and had agreed to accompany him despite his lack of any prestige whatsoever. She would surely have been torn to shreds back home if her family ever found out what she had done. Perhaps they would even think she'd shamed them.

Yet... Slughorn looked displeased. It was almost as though he had hoped for Harry to do better, but how could he have? He could think of no one in the castle more suitable using the parameters Slughorn himself had laid out over the summer holidays. The man's face was appropriately jovial by the time Harry had even finished that train of thought.

"An excellent catch indeed," said Slughorn with a broad smile that looked awful tight on his lips. "I look forward to seeing you there. Good day, Harry. I will see you in class tomorrow."

Elena always looked a bit put-out any time Slughorn completely ignored her, but she looked more annoyed than usual this morning. There was no way she would listen to his explanations now. They would have to come later.

"Uh... should we get to breakfast?"

Elena nodded curtly and the two of them moved off in awkward silence.

***October 31, 1942***

***Horace Slughorn's Office***

***8:00 PM***

Samhain had dawned with all the beautiful temperatures and vibrant sunlight one would expect from the most auspicious day of the year. In other words, the skies were dark and dreary, bringing with them the promise of fast-coming rain and the air outside was frigid and felt more like the beginning of December than it did the end of October.

Most in the castle bemoaned the bleak skies and bitter cold, but Harry was oddly grateful for all of it. Better this than to be lulled into a false sense of security by utopian landscapes and pleasant excursions. Something was surely bound to happen today. Best it not ruin an otherwise enjoyable one; just let the day be a wash as a whole.

It was quite the depressing mindset to carry, but Harry\'s ten years on Privet Drive had taught him that when imminent doom approached, it was best to meet it with the lowest of expectations.

The day itself was wholly uneventful. Harry and Elena had moved past the quietly awkward stage brought on by the announcement of Harry's partner to the Samhain festivities, but there was still an unspoken air of tension between them that made Harry want to rip his hair out of his head. It was maddening, truly maddening. What was he to do about it? There was no answer; he was sure of it; he had spent the better part of the last week pondering on it because it bothered him more than anything --- his dread over tonight's inevitabilities notwithstanding.

The time finally came for him to leave the common room and make his way down towards Slughorn's office. Elena was nowhere to be found. She had needed air some time ago and fled the dungeons for a walk. Harry had wanted to follow but had sensed doing so would not be wise, though he had hoped she would return by now. He cast his eyes about the common room one final time before leaving it. He sensed that by the time he returned later this evening, much would be different in one way or another. It had to be after the measures he had taken weeks back. Now, he could only hope that they were enough to skive off what he knew would likely come tonight.

His footsteps seemed to echo louder than usual off the ancient stone floors as he descended deeper into the bowels of the castle. It was like how he thought criminals must feel while being led to their fast-approaching executions.

A bustling crowd was already waiting for him outside the doors to Slughorn's chosen room. Some were filtering in but more still were waiting in the queue. Harry wondered how so many guests were possible. The Hogwarts population was definitely much larger now than it had been in his own time, but not by such an alarming degree as to make this expansive guest list possible. Then, he remembered all of Slughorn's hints about important guests from outside the castle. Merlin, the man had not been kidding in the slightest. Harry had always wondered whether Slughorn frequently hyperbolized his never-ending list of connections. He certainly wasn't wondering tonight; the turnout was nothing short of miraculous.

"Good evening, Harry."

He almost jumped a foot in the air but somehow managed to compose himself and slowly turn around. It was Riddle and his companion for the evening.

Harry would have been lying if he said Cassiopeia looked anything short of gorgeous. She wore a long, sleeveless dress of midnight blue that matched the colour of her eyes to perfection. Her long black hair was done up in a single, elegant braid. It flowed down her back like a velvety black waterfall.

Riddle herself was much the opposite. She had not bothered with a dress, a gown, or any alterations whatsoever to her usual attire. She wore her plain black robes and trainers with the prefect's badge pinned to her chest as always. Her hair cascaded down her back, but that was how she always wore it.

"Evening, Riddle."

"Introductions are in order. Harry, this is my closest friend, Cassiopeia."

"Nice to meet you," said Harry, bowing his head, stepping forward, and taking her offered hand. Slughorn surely would have called the gesture clumsy, but it felt foreign at the best of times and his heart felt fit to burst straight out of his chest.

"A pleasure," the girl responded in a cool and quiet voice. It was the sort of voice that pulled one in, but Harry also had no doubt it could cut like a knife. He had no difficulty at all imagining Cassiopeia as a feared black widow --- much like the mother of one of his old Hogwarts classmates, Blaise Zabini.

Emily opened her mouth to speak, but another voice made itself known before she could.

"Ah, yes, there they are! The very two we were just discussing!"

Slughorn bustled through the crowd, wearing flowing dress robes of emerald green and a grin so broad his face seemed to burst. A tall man walked alongside him. His robes were elegant and as dark as his raven hair.

"Harry, Emily, I have so many wonderful people I would like you to meet. This is Wilbert Slinkhard. He's the European Champion in open-class duelling from this past year. A very bright future on the circuits in front of him. One of many who would like to meet two of my most brightly shining stars. Come, come; so much to do, so many people to meet!"

***Some time later...***

Harry was beginning to realize why Riddle might have set him up with Cassiopeia. It actually might not have been for reasons as sinister as Harry might have feared, but of course, he still kept his guard high at all times. Despite her status and her family's prestige, Cassiopeia just did not demand the same amount of attention from Slughorn. It was Harry and Emily who he most wanted to show off. They were paraded around like trophies.

Vexing and tiresome as it was, it had its benefits. Harry found himself not only meeting continental champions in duelling and high-ranking ministry officials, but lords and ladies of prestigious families, famous Quidditch stars, and successful entrepreneurs. An all star lineup of the most important and successful people in the country all shook Harry's hand, greeted him politely, and asked him a bit about himself. They were more interested in Cassiopeia than Slughorn was and Harry wondered if Riddle had known that would be the case. It would actually have been quite the clever play if that was her goal, but Harry did not allow himself to hope. Not when the stakes were so incredibly high.

It was not until some time later that Cassiopeia asked for a break from it all. Her feet were apparently aching. Her footwear definitely suggested as much and Harry did not begrudge the break. Getting away from Riddle was always a plus. He would watch her, but keeping an eye on her wasn't difficult. A procession followed her and Slughorn around; all he had to do was keep watchful eyes on all of them. Fatigue had also begun to set in. He had not been raised like this and he found the whole experience completely exhausting.

"Sorry about all this," he muttered to Cassiopeia. "I'm sure you don't mind the connections, but I didn't want Slughorn to just ignore you the whole time."

She shrugged. "Slughorn is just a gateway. It doesn't matter if he pays attention to me. He has important connections, but he's not important. It's what they think that matters."

"I suppose." Harry had never quite thought that way. Especially not after Slughorn had forged him a new identity from scratch.

"May I have a glass of wine?" Harry heard Cassiopeia ask. She had already indulged in a number of them. Her pale skin had gained an edge of colour in the last hour or so, but Harry politely stood to oblige her nevertheless.

Finding wine in that room was hardly difficult. House elves were bustling in every direction, levitating beverage-ladened trays over their bobbing heads and flopping ears all the while. Getting the drink back to his companion proved far more difficult. She was far from the only one who was touched by the flavours of fine wine. A fair number of students and guests alike were dancing sporadically and some were just chatting in the middle of it all, showing absolutely no regard for any who came near.

Harry had almost made it back when a tall, thick-set boy slammed into him. The wine glass fell from his grasp and shattered on the floor. The din of the room was such that he barely heard the breaking glass, but he felt it pierce his arm when he followed its path to the floor a moment later with a loud curse.

"Sorry," said the other boy. Harry could hear the disdain in his voice before he even looked up. Seeing Silas Mulciber came as no surprise.

"Shove off," spat Harry when he retook his feet, pushing past Mulciber and heading for the nearest tray once more.

By the time he returned to the table, his robes were stained red and smelled of the tangy scent from which the stains had come from. He was in a storming mood as he handed Cassiopeia the wine and retook his seat with as much grace as he could muster, but his anger subsided a moment later, only to be replaced by numb shock and a crushing sense of sudden horror.

He had gone back to searching the room without thinking when he retook his seat, but this time, his target was nowhere to be found. Whilst searching for the wine, he had allowed his focus on Riddle to lapse. Harry had abandoned his tracking altogether after the incident with Mulciber and he suddenly wondered whether this whole thing had been planned, for Emily Riddle was nowhere to be seen.

All was lost on the front of monitoring her --- now, all he could do was hope that his measures taken earlier in the month would be enough and that his newest friend had kept his word.

***Meanwhile, on the second floor...***

Emily had to resist the urge to break into a flat sprint as the door of that dreaded bathroom loomed near. Her heart was beating faster than she could ever remember. Faster than when she had scaled the cliffs as a young girl, faster than when that rabbit had hung from the rafters, and faster even than when Dumbledore had appeared at the orphanage all those years ago. Her entire abdomen felt like it was vibrating and her legs shook beneath her.

Yet still, she was diligent; recasting Homenum Revelio every few metres to ensure she was alone. Finally, she reached the door and allowed her Disillusionment Charm to fall as she stepped inside. Murky water rose up around her shoes, but she didn't care; she ouldn't care about anything but what was ahead.

**"Open!"**

The sound of grinding stone roared throughout the room. Emily hastily cast Silencing Charms upon the door as the noise built and built like a revving jet engine. The engraved sink she had discovered not even a week ago was now sliding aside and her eyes were alight with a manic gleam as a filth-coated tube large enough to slide down protruded out from the darkness behind where the sink had been a moment earlier.

Not even the slimy grime covering the slide could deter Emily nor put a damper on what she thought must be the finest moment in her still-young life. The first of many, she thought as she climbed into the tube and allowed the feeling of weightlessness to take hold of her. It was addicting. The most addicting thing she had ever felt; there was nothing like it. She had never deigned to touch a broomstick and she thought them quite undignified, but if the feeling of soaring through the skies was anything like this, she would one day find another way to fly.

Walking through the tunnels was all a blur. Her footsteps must have echoed, but she never heard them. All she heard was the blood racing in her ears and the sound of her own heartbeat thundering so loud it was like someone had begun beating a mighty drum inside her skull.

Many would have shed their own skin at the sight of the massive green one that must have once belonged to the monstrous serpent she knew dwelled within this chamber's depths, but not her. Emily's heart soared and beat still faster --- she was close, she knew she was close. Soon, the dream she had held for several years would be fulfilled.

And there it was --- a set of massive stone doors with serpentine carvings almost as old as the castle itself.

**"Open,"** she hissed once again, more urgent than she had back up in the bathroom minutes earlier.

These doors parted more quietly than the sink had given way. Not that it mattered; Emily was through them before they had fully opened and her intense blue eyes swept across the fabled chamber, devouring it all like she had dreamed of doing for so long.

The room itself was beautiful. Carved from ancient stone, with elegant pillars reaching so high they touched a ceiling whose splendour was lost in an impenetrable pool of darkness. Sinister things seemed to crawl up the walls, dancing in the long, leaping shadows cast by flickering torches all about the room. Snakes were depicted everywhere and their likenesses made up tattered mosaics that lined the floor. A thin layer of dust coated the room, but it really wasn't as thick as Emily might have expected.

That actually struck her as mightily odd. How had such a small amount of dust accumulated in such a long period of time? It had been a thousand years; surely this room should have been beyond repair, magic or not?

Then, she saw them --- feet-shaped holes in the dust that could only be one thing.

Footprints.

Her heart's beating redoubled.

No... it couldn't be. This must be some kind of trickery. The rest of the room was so well-preserved --- perhaps she was looking upon the footsteps of Salazar Slytherin himself.

Yet... there had been someone lurking in that corridor.

Emily forcefully cleared her mind and let a probe of magic flow from her wand. It found no one; she was alone, at least for now.

Irrational fear fought to overwhelm her as she marched purposefully towards the towering statue of Salazar Slytherin, but she held it at bay. It mattered not --- only she had the power to do this and that was all that mattered.

"**Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts four!**"

Deafening silence greeted her words and for the first time in what felt like years, her Occlumency failed her as the reality of what must have happened bowled over her like a concussive blast. Emily Riddle fell to her knees, clawing at her chest as she screamed like a poisoned dagger had pierced her heart.

**Chapter 12: Preemptive Precautions**

***October 31, 1942***

***The Dungeons***

***11:13 PM***

Realizing Riddle had left Slughorn's office had been one of the most worrying moments of Harry's life. There was nothing he could do. It would be improper to leave and Cassiopeia was in no hurry to allow him to. Harry had a feeling Riddle's entire posse would have done their best to block his exit had he tried. Then, there was Slughorn to contend with. He pursued Harry with the persistence of a starved mosquito in the midst of a hot and humid summer. No matter what Harry did, he couldn't shake the man. The professor had permitted him a break to relax with Black, but nothing beyond that.

His heart beat faster and faster as the minutes ticked by. Where was Riddle? Had she made a move on the Chamber of Secrets? Part of him knew that question was naive. Where else would she have gone after slipping away on such an auspicious evening? Most of all when Harry knew it was the day a version of her had thought to be significant fifty years later.

The real question was whether or not Riddle had been successful in entering the Chamber of Secrets. She ought not to, but that didn't mean she hadn't. Harry had done all he could to ensure she was locked out but this was Emily Riddle. Whether she grew up to become Voldemort or not, she was every bit as gifted as Tom had ever been. If anyone could find a way to bypass the measures Harry had put in place, it would be her.

That was assuming she would need to bypass them at all.

Harry had only the word of a thousand-year-old snake to work with and his trust in that source of information was shaky at best.

***The Past***

***October 11, 1942***

***The Second Floor***

Harry waited for something to go wrong as he crept nearer and nearer to the bathroom he had known as Moaning Myrtle's. Even now it was out of order, which Harry thought was odd. He had always imagined that was because of what happened when Riddle had opened the chamber. Perhaps it had been Slytherin or perhaps it had been someone who had come to the castle in later years and actually discovered the founder's final secret.

It mattered not, but it was an interesting tidbit that Harry found himself grateful for. The fewer people lurking around this part of the castle the better for him. Tonight, anyway. He may soon wish for more lurkers if this failed and if Riddle did indeed unleash the basilisk on the school and its ill-prepared population. More lurkers would make it harder for her to be as subtle as the diary had been during Harry's own time.

Though it was mightily convenient for him tonight --- especially without the protection his father's cloak had once offered him.

The cloak... he had found himself thinking about it more and more as time stretched on. More still since he had first caught a glimpse of Charlus Potter.

Did he have the cloak? Had the Lord Potter passed it onto him, or did he still have it? Perhaps on account of the war against Grindelwald and the first strike on British soil that past summer in Diagon Alley?

It made Harry crave it. It had been the one true link he had shared to his father, and dead useful at that. There was no hope of counting how many times it had gotten him out of trouble.

He could have used that now.

Harry had been practicing the Homenum Revelio Charm on and off since Riddle had taught it to him, but it was far from perfect. The suspicion that she was lurking somewhere near persisted even as the bathroom's door loomed into sight.

It was with a final glance to both sides that Harry pushed it open and stepped inside. It was... cleaner. In Harry's time --- or world, or whatever the hell it had been --- the walls had shown obvious signs of decay. It had been like they'd stood against many great storms. The stones of his time had been smoothed out like these ones, but they were more battered, with mould growing in between the stones and the bathroom constantly smelling like the unclean water that often coated the floor like a tight plastic wrapping in the muggle world.

The sinks were still there and Harry could see the symbol carved into the all too familiar tap. It was odd to see it from here. During his second year, he had needed to creep closer to the sink. He would never have thought it was a snake without knowing the truth, but he could tell *something* was there. It was a mark of how effective R.E. Gress's ritual had been. Merlin, Harry was happy not to have seen much of that nutter since arriving at the school. The man was evidently some sort of genius, but the stories he'd heard from students in his class were the stuff of nightmares.

Harry cast one last Homenum Revelio before fixing his eyes upon the small carving and squinting. From the right angle, the etched serpent still looked as though it was writhing back and forth.

**"Open!"**

The sound of stone grinding against stone filled his ears. That worried him more than anything, but he was gone before it could be heard and Harry could hear the entrance close behind him as he rocketed down the tube.

There was darkness all around him as he plunged into the belly of the castle, but Harry could see the outlines of other pipes and tubes branching off this way and that. They looked like a snake slithering through the night, coiled and ready to strike at unsuspecting prey. Harry shivered --- it was easy to imagine himself in that undesirable position.

The tunnel at the shoot's bottom was as dusty and undisturbed as he remembered. The massive snake's skin was already there, but Harry was grateful that Lockhart had not yet made a fool of himself whilst collapsing half the tunnel in the process. They'd had Voldemort as a professor in his first year and Harry *still* considered Lockhart the worst professor he'd ever had.

The tunnel twisted on for further than Harry remembered. It was funny how time and space seemed to bend and warp depending on the mood of those traversing them. When Harry had been frail, afraid, and dreading the end of this tunnel more than anything he had ever dreaded in his life, it felt shorter than most corridors. Now, it seemed to go on forever, like the passages beneath Gringotts Harry had seen whilst joining Hagrid as the jolly half giant retrieved the Philosopher's Stone.

The first sign that the end was near was Harry's footsteps echoing back at him. Before, the noise had simply risen and been lost in the endless blackness far above him. The ceiling must have been very high, for Harry could not see it in this damp and morbid place.

He paused before the chamber doors, just as he had in another life. The snakes carved here were larger and had a splendour to them that the ones in the bathroom lacked. It took no imagination at all to picture them twisting and hissing, alive with restless mischief.

**"Open."**

Harry shivered as he stepped inside. The Chamber of Secrets was a drafty place, but Harry suspected that had little to do with his tremor. How many nightmares this place had featured in over his last year living back in his own time with his own friends...

He shook off the memories and moved slowly through the chamber. It was actually smaller than he had once thought. Now that he wasn't focusing so entirely on Ginny, Riddle, and the murderous basilisk, the room seemed less shadowy and almost more real.

Well... Harry supposed not that entire statement was true. He was here with one of the same things in mind he'd been thinking about that first time.

**"Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts four."**

It took tremendous willpower to speak the words. They had almost meant his death once, but now he had to speak them for himself. Now he had to speak them in his bid to pursue life and to fend off death for him and for so many nameless others. For poor Myrtle Warren and all the other muggleborns who Riddle sought to target. This was bigger than him and his fears; this was what he had to do.

None of that meant Harry didn't cringe away when he heard something begin to stir. Every sound it made was as massive as it was. Harry looked away when he could finally hear it slithering free and he jumped about a foot in the air when it hit the floor so hard that the stones beneath his feet trembled with the same fear pumping through him with every furious beat of his heart.

**"A speaker?"**

The voice was... odd. Harry couldn't tell whether it was a male or female, but he could tell just by hearing it that it had lived for many years. There was a sort of power in the way it hissed, an authority with which it demanded answers from the one who had freed it after so long.

**"Yes,"** Harry hissed back, **"I speak."**

**"You are one of his, then?"**

**"One of whose?"** Harry asked, trying to hide the uncertainty rising within him. Perhaps this hadn't been the best idea.

What if the snake could tell he had not been the one destined to find it? What if it could smell his fear? His eyes were closed, but what if it snapped at him like that boa constrictor at the zoo all those years ago? The answer would be that Harry would be far worse for wear than Dudley or Piers had been and that he would be extremely fortunate to ever leave this chamber. There was no Fawkes to save him this time.

***"His!"*** the basilisk hissed. **"The one who left me here."**

Relief surged in Harry when he realized what the snake meant. Never had it felt so good to understand. If he had been half as clueless here as he had been during Trelawney's class in his own time, that may well have meant the end of him.

**"I am the Heir of Slytherin,"** Harry pronounced, straightening his posture and trying to look as dignified as he could whilst his eyes were clamped shut. Not seeing the monster before him was extremely off-putting.

Harry could sense the serpent's eyes on him, sense death reaching for him with bone-like hands whose fingers were just inches too short. **"Good,"** hissed the basilisk. **"I have waited for many years."**

**"I bring news."**

**"News?"** the snake asked. **"What is this news you speak of?"**

**"I have come just in time. I am the rightful Heir of Salazar Slytherin, but I'm not the only speaker who may find this place. There is a usurper in the castle and she will come."**

Harry thought he heard something that might have been the basilisk flicking its tongue and tasting the air, but it was impossible to tell with his eyes pressed so tightly closed.

**"She will come too late,"** said the basilisk. **"You are here first; Master can have only one true heir."**

***The present...***

That had been nearly three weeks ago. Harry had begun to sense that Riddle's opening move was coming and could see no other way of blocking it. It was the boldest thing he had ever done. Now, he only hoped it paid off as he neared the Slytherin common room with a somewhat tipsy Cassiopeia walking alongside him. She did not hang off his arm the same way many of the other witches did their dates'. She was polite and courteous, but it was clear she was there out of obligation. Riddle had clearly put her up to it and she had clearly been meant as little more than a distraction. It was a small miracle that Harry had thought to act preemptively, but it would be a larger one still if his actions had led to results.

Harry held his breath as the wall into the Slytherin common room slid aside. There had been no news of an attack, but he had been down in Slughorn's office. It was possible that they had all just not been made aware as of yet, but he would know for sure the second he stepped into the Slytherin common room.

A relieved exhale of breath left Harry the moment they entered. It was quite the opposite of how he normally reacted. This dark and sinister place still felt as alien to him as a quill had the first time he'd ever picked one up. He felt like his place was still Gryffindor Tower --- the warm, cozy room with its crackling fires and stunning views.

Harry felt a stare on him the second he entered the common room and didn't need to seek it out to know whose it was.

He looked at her anyway. That seemed less suspicious to him than avoiding eye contact altogether. The casual look of interest she so often adopted was there, but Harry could see exactly how strained it was. Other emotions were fighting for dominance and threatening to spread across her face and there was a glint in her eye he had never seen there before.

It was an odd light that seemed to lunge forward before retreating back. A mad sort of light that promised nothing for Harry but the things he had most worried about since first laying eyes on Emily Riddle all the way back in Diagon Alley.

He had saved Myrtle Warren and countless others, but Harry suddenly wondered exactly what that heroism would cost him.

***November 2, 1942***

***The Potions Classroom***

***10:18 AM***

Harry and Dorea had finished brewing before the rest of the class. Harry was getting better at Potions. He found himself more and more comfortable the longer he spent partnering with Dorea. She had a very rational and patient way of explaining things that resonated with him. It was far removed from Snape, who loomed like a bat over the students' shoulders and hissed in their ears when they least expected it.

The sound of simmering cauldrons filled Harry's ears as he leant back in his chair and surveyed the room. Being the first ones done wasn't a new experience for them. This was actually one of their slower brews, but Slughorn still beamed at Harry from across the room. Harry was altogether pleased by the fact he seemed distracted trying to prevent Avery and Flint from melting their cauldron.

"Are you all right?" Dorea asked. "You seem distracted."

"I'm fine," Harry answered. "It's just... been a long few days."

Dorea's dark eyes darted around the room before she slid her wand from her sleeve. Harry saw her give it a flick. Nothing noticeable changed, but Dorea put it away with satisfaction. She must have cast some sort of privacy ward.

"Has *she* been bothering you?"

Harry tilted his head. "Who's she?"

Dorea appeared to check the space around them again despite whatever spell she had just used. "Riddle."

"I haven't talked to her since before Slughorn's party. Why?"

"Just... she's been acting oddly ever since then."

Harry felt his heart skip a beat. "Has she?"

He knew he should have been watching Riddle more closely than ever, but he had been doing much the opposite. Harry feared that too much of his attention would give him away. Riddle thought she knew something already. Let her think --- that was one thing --- having her know was another altogether.

"You haven't noticed?" asked Dorea.

"I can't say I make a habit of paying attention to Riddle."

"That makes you smarter than most people, but it doesn't help you in this case. Care to know what you've missed?"

"You make it sound like I don't have much choice in the matter."

"Not if you're half as smart as you just made yourself sound, no."

Harry rubbed tiredly at his eyes; it had been a long two days. "Fine. What's going on with her?"

"She's been watching you lately. More than usual since Slughorn's party. It's... actually kind of disturbing. I've never seen her look at anyone like that."

"Like what?"

Dorea seemed to chew on her words as she studied Harry. "I'm not sure you've noticed, but Riddle has this way of looking at people. It's... odd. She just never looks interested. Almost like she's completely detached."

Harry knew exactly the look Dorea was talking about. He had seen it many times. She wore it most of the time she was around him, but Harry had seen it falter when she pressed him about his imaginary time at Ilvermorny or when she spoke about something like magic.

"I know the look you mean, yeah."

"She's not looking at you like that. Not since Slughorn's party, anyway. I don't know what changed, but... there's more there."

"More how?"

"I don't know. She just... she always has a way of making people she stares at uncomfortable, but I'm surprised her eyes haven't cut you open and burned you from the inside out."

"Do you think she's upset?"

"I don't know what she is. She might not be upset. It's just... intense. *Really* intense."

That made sense. If things that interested Riddle made her drop the uncaring facade, this would surely rank near the top of the list if she suspected Harry of locking her out of the Chamber of Secrets.

And why wouldn't she?

A mysterious transfer student shows up at Hogwarts and displays at least one instance of exceptional magic. Then she --- the true Heiress of Salazar Slytherin --- is locked out of the chamber her ancestor once built. It was a very convenient set of events that even Harry had a hard time imagining as a coincidence. Somebody as intelligent as Riddle surely could have put the pieces together. That look she had given him that night in the common room... It wasn't the one Dorea was talking about. Riddle had at least tried to keep her mask in place, she had just done a much poorer job of it than ever before.

"And you think it means something?" Harry asked after a pause.

"You would know better than me, wouldn't you?"

Harry shrugged. "You're the one who picked up on it in the first place. I didn't even do that."

Dorea made a face. "Did you do anything at Slughorn's party?"

Harry ran a hand through his hair. "I... uh, did a lot of talking. Slughorn was showing me off like the Quidditch Cup or something and I---"

"That's not what I mean." Dorea was trying to glare at him, but Harry could see that she was amused. "Okay, let me rephrase that. Did you do anything involving Riddle or that might have gotten a reaction out of her?"

Harry thought about it. "Well, I went with Cassiopeia, but Riddle was the one who set that up and she seemed pleased about it."

"You let Riddle set up your date?" Dorea asked with wide eyes.

"I didn't let Riddle do anything. She spoke in front of Slughorn before I could cut her off."

"Harry, if you give that girl an inch, she's going to take a mile."

He snorted. "If a mile goes from one end of London to the other, then maybe."

Dorea hid a smirk behind her hand as she feigned a yawn. "Anything else?"

"I... uh, bumped into Mulciber, but that wasn't my fault."

"Define bumped into?"

"Literally bumped into. Well, he bumped into me. I was getting wine for Cassiopeia and then he just came barreling into me. I think it was a setup or something. I beat him in a duel a while ago in Merrythought's class."

"I heard about that. It wouldn't surprise me if you're right. Mulciber --- well, a lot of Riddle's crew, really --- are vicious."

"Really?" Harry asked with eyebrows raised as far as he could manage. "I never would have imagined. They seem so pleasant."

"Well then, I guess you're not as smart as I thought you were."

"Rich thing to say coming from someone who thought I was smart. That would be your first mistake."

Dorea stifled a giggle. "We should talk more," she said with a slight blush.

Harry almost dropped the knife he was tossing from one hand to the other, catching it deftly each time. It very nearly sliced straight through his skin. "What?"

"You and I," she said, blushing even harder. "We talk a lot in Potions, but we hardly ever do when we're not here. I like Fawley, too. We could get along well."

This was new and uncharted territory for Harry. His friendships with Ron and Hermione had just kind of happened. Fighting a mountain troll together at the age of eleven just sort of did that. His other friends were housemates or extensions of his inner circle, but Gryffindors were different from Slytherins. Most of them were at least on good terms without any effort from either party. It was different in Slytherin. There was always a certain amount of underlying tension that had never been there in Gryffindor Tower.

"I... think I'd like that," Harry agreed.

Dorea beamed at him just as Slughorn finally bustled his way towards them and she was forced to lower whatever ward she had raised around their brewing station.

***November 6, 1942***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***8:54 PM***

Harry hadn't been so nervous for a Runes session with Riddle since they had met for the first time in this room. That had only been worse because it had felt so very much like leaping into the unknown. Riddle was still a shadowy figure who Harry knew little about, but he now understood she was unlikely to attack him so openly.

Tonight was going to test that. Tonight, Harry felt like a man on his deathbed, waiting for a fatal illness to claim him as he moved closer and closer to the room in which he met with Riddle.

Riddle suspected him, but how deeply? Was it enough to attack him? To try and rip the secrets from his mind? Would she threaten him? Would she blackmail him? Would she be doing something so dastardly or nefarious that Harry had not yet considered it? He doubted it; he had considered what he thought was everything that could possibly go wrong, but Merlin only knew.

He was at the door to the classroom much too fast. How he wished the corridor could have stretched on and on. How he wished to be anywhere but here as he tentatively reached out and pushed the door open, his other hand on his wand. He doubted it would do him much good if Riddle chose to attack, but he would rather not make the same mistake his father had made and leave his wand behind.

Riddle was there, waiting behind the same desk she always lurked behind, twirling a dark lock of hair around her finger as she waited. Harry looked for anything about her he had never seen before. That look Dorea had warned him about earlier in the week, the light in her eye he had spotted in the common room last Saturday, or anything else that indicated any threat of danger.

There was nothing that he could see.

That only made him shiver more. There was no way Riddle was just letting her suspicion go. Whether she was to become Voldemort or not, too many people feared her. She would not have developed the unspoken reputation she had if she was so lenient.

Which could only mean one thing.

Riddle was bottling everything up as she studied him, watching for an opening and preparing to explode at the first sign of weakness.

For the second time in the past week, Harry suddenly felt like the prey of some quietly slithering snake twice his size and with the venom to kill him in seconds. It was a far less pleasant feeling this time around.

**Chapter 13: Lingering Shadows**

***November 19, 1942***

***The Chamber of Secrets***

***11:43 PM***

There had been nearly three weeks between Harry's first and second visit to the Chamber of Secrets, but he found himself returning with increasing regularity ever since Riddle's demeanour had changed. It was the best place to go where she couldn't get to him, which he found comfort in. Especially because he knew how badly she wanted to get down into the chamber. Taking that away from her was satisfying in a cruel, twisted sort of way.

Tonight was different. Tomorrow, Harry would meet with Riddle and she would tutor him in Ancient Runes. It would be the third time they had met since she had first suspected him of locking her out of the Chamber of Secrets.

Their first meeting had truly unnerved him. There was no ambush, no attack, not even a threat. Just cold and calculating intentions looming behind those dark blue eyes like deadly predators hidden by shadow or the pitch of night. Harry could feel those intentions bubbling every time he looked at Riddle, but she never acted. That was the worst thing of all. If she would have just cursed him, at least it would be done. Not knowing what she was planning or how exactly she planned to take revenge worried him.

On the outside, she had remained the same as always. Polite, courteous, intrigued by him and eager to learn more --- nothing seemed to have changed. Harry knew better, but Riddle masked it well. If not for Dorea's warning and that first night in the common room, he was unsure whether he would have suspected anything at all; that was almost as bad as the waiting. Knowing that she could strike without him knowing anything was coming was disconcerting. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always played offence. It had been them who made the moves once they pieced together the puzzles. It had felt like a choice

This felt anything but. Every time Harry talked with Riddle, locked eyes with her, or was even in the same room, he felt a step behind and like he was being led astray. All of her friends treated him the same. They paid him no heed --- except for Mulciber, who still glared hatefully towards him any chance he got. The boy had not taken his defeat to Harry in Merrythought's first day of duelling well, and Harry was sure that whatever motive Riddle had was the only reason Mulciber had not yet tried to properly attack him.

**"You seem stressed."**

Harry had let Cerastes free of the statue once he entered the Chamber of Secrets. The snake hissed from behind him so as not to be in Harry's field of vision. It was odd talking to a creature without looking at it, but Harry much preferred the awkwardness to the fatal alternative.

**"Just... distracted."**

**"Distracted?"**

**"It's been hectic. Ever since right after I came here the first time."**

There was a pause during which Cerastes seemed to consider Harry's words. **"Is it the usurper?"**

That was what Cerastes called Riddle. Harry had never given the snake her name, so he supposed he couldn't blame him. It was ironic, really. Harry was the one who had effectively usurped Riddle and her title, but he had no plans of telling the basilisk that.

**"It is,"** Harry admitted.

**"Let me rip her, let me tear her, let me kill her."**

A shiver ran up Harry's spine. Those words were terrifyingly familiar. They were the same ones the snake had hissed in his own time when commanded by a different master.

Cerastes was an interesting case. He was a snake, first and foremost. An apex predator who had no qualms about killing at will. Yet the snake was not a monster. It was the vessel for the Heir's will. That was what Harry had learned quickly. Under the control of Tom Riddle, he had ravaged the muggleborn population of Hogwarts not once, but twice. Whilst following Harry, he dozed off and on in the Chamber of Secrets, waiting for him to return with tidings and food. The snake demanded nothing from him, but enjoyed speaking with Harry. Any small bits of information seemed welcome. Harry could hardly blame it; it had dwelled here unaccompanied for the better part of a thousand years.

It was just so odd how the creature could be so very different when controlled by a new master. Hell, even the notion of a beast like this being controlled by anyone was strange. It could have killed Harry at any time and there was nothing he could have done about it. How Slytherin had convinced the snake to serve his heirs so loyally, Harry would never know.

**"Thanks, but I don't think I'll need you to do that."**

Harry could hear the snake slithering behind him. It almost felt disappointed. **"It has been so long since I have truly hunted."**

**"One day, maybe I'll ask you to hunt her."** Harry hoped not. He had actually never considered the notion until now. If Riddle became too much like Voldemort by the time her seventh year rolled around, Harry did have a weapon of mass destruction at his disposal.

But could he use it? Could he condemn Riddle to death before she had passed the point of no return? What was the point of no return, anyway? It struck him then for the thousandth time how little he knew about Voldemort in his own time. Knowing more would have been helpful here. He really could end the threat with the basilisk --- however good Riddle was, Harry would have been astounded had she defeated Cerastes in her fifth year.

That was a thought, though. If he waited too long... could she defeat the basilisk by the end of her seventh? Would the Killing Curse be effective against a beast of Cerastes' scale? Could Riddle cast the curse already? If not, surely she would by the time she graduated...

There were far too many questions with answers being much too scarce. Nothing Harry had ever done felt so complicated. It seemed like the mysteries never ended --- more and more of them flinging themselves at him before he could free himself of the last.

**"Is she not a threat to you?"** Cerastes asked.

Harry ran a frustrated hand through his hair. **"That's the problem."**

**"What is the problem?"**

**"That I don't know. Everything I know about her says that she's a threat and I get a bad feeling when I'm around her---"**

**"Then she's a threat."**

**"But she's done nothing to me. She hasn't moved against me and I'm not even sure whether she's tried to come down here yet or not."**

**"You should always trust how you feel. That is important for witches and wizards."**

Something about the way Cerastes said that struck Harry as odd. He had heard all the cliches about gut feelings and of following one's heart in the muggle world. It had never been the type of rhetoric Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon preached, but he had been exposed to it in other places.

This seemed different.

Important for *witches and wizards*.

**"What do you mean?"** Harry asked.

He heard the snake's slithering pause. **"What has you confused?"**

**"I've heard people say stuff like that, but never about witches and wizards. Just about people in general. Was that just worded differently?"**

There was a long pause. **"Close your eyes,"** Cerastes demanded.

Harry frowned, though the snake could not see it from behind him. **"What?"**

**"Close your eyes. I would like to test you."**

Harry shut his eyes with great trepidation. It had taken him some time and several visits to trust the snake to be out of the statue. Harry highly doubted he was about to get double-crossed even though his heart seemed far more worried than his brain. If he was, it hardly mattered whether his eyes were open or not.

**"Okay,"** he hissed after a deep, centring breath, **"my eyes are closed."**

**"Breathe deeply and feel."**

Harry's frown deepened. **"What do you mean 'feel'?"**

The snake's hissing was incoherent. **"Do you not know?"**

Harry shook his head before realizing the snake might not even be looking at him. Back turned or not, Cerastes tended to err on the side of caution. **"No,"** he hissed after that realization.

If snakes could sigh, Harry was sure Cerastes would have. **"You have much to learn,"** the basilisk decided. **"We will begin practising now. You will learn to feel, and then the usurper shall not worry you so much."**

Harry hadn't the foggiest idea how those two things were related, but he was desperate enough to give just about anything a try.

***November 20, 1942***

***The Great Hall***

***8:42 AM***

The mood in the castle was divided that morning. A *Daily Prophet* article had released and covered important developments from the front lines of the war against Grindelwald and his forces. It was odd for Harry to read it knowing what would happen. Or, what had happened in his reality.

The Soviets had launched strikes against the forces surrounding Stalingrad. The fight was happening on both the muggle and wizarding sides. It was going well for the Soviets thus far and Harry knew that if it played out anything like how it had in his reality, this would be one of the most crippling losses the Nazis would sustain, at least on the muggle side.

Opinions about this were... divided.

It was easy to see which students had family supporting Grindelwald at the Slytherin table, or so Harry had thought.

"It's not that simple," Dorea was explaining.

She had quietly become a fixture in Harry's life ever since that day in Potions when she had warned him about the shift in Riddle's behaviour and offered her hand in friendship. She had slid quietly in with Harry and Elena, expanding their duo to a trio. It felt surprisingly natural and reminded Harry of when Hermione had joined up with him and Ron after the mountain troll incident back in first year.

"What do you mean?" Harry asked in a whisper quiet enough for prying ears to miss.

"If Grindelwald's forces pull out of Russia, they might look for a different target," Dorea said just as quietly.

Harry pondered that for a moment before his eyes widened. "You don't mean---"

"Britain."

"Isn't Grindelwald supposed to be scared of Dumbledore?" That was the impression Harry had always gotten. Dumbledore had even been the one to defeat him, which lended a certain amount of credence to the theory.

"That's what some people say," said Dorea. "Other people say that it's Dumbledore who's afraid. Especially after the attack in Diagon Alley this summer."

"Grindelwald wasn't there, though," Harry pointed out.

"No, they say he wasn't. Would you go on the first mission to a new country? Plenty of people think that was just a probe."

"So, what?" asked Elena. "He wanted to test British defences?"

"That, or test how fast Dumbledore would show up." Dorea shrugged. "I'm no strategist."

"Just a Black," Elena quipped, a nervous smile upon her face.

Dorea smiled back at her. "Yes, just a Black."

***That night...***

Harry could tell something was different about that night the second he and Riddle concluded their discussion about Ancient Runes. It was remarkable how far he had come under her tutelage. It was not yet three months into the school year and Harry had all but caught up with the third years. He was actually starting to grasp concepts well enough to begin learning the fourth-year curriculum on his own. It was unreasonably fulfilling and Harry thought he could finally understand why Hermione had taken so much pleasure in burying her face in books for hours and hours on end.

Riddle watched him when they finished. She often looked at him, but she avoided truly watching him nowadays when he was looking. That wasn't to say she didn't do it. Dorea had caught her at it many times, and even Harry had felt her stare burning into him on occasion.

"What did you think of the morning's news, if you don't mind me asking?"

The question caught Harry off guard. Riddle somehow hadn't struck him as the type to ask about international politics. Least of all when their relationship was as subtly delicate now as one could imagine.

Harry chewed his lip as he considered what Dorea had said and what he knew. "I hope the Soviets massacre them," he said, not forgetting the lie he had told Riddle about his parents' deaths.

She tilted her head. "Do you?"

"Course I do. Those are the same bastards that killed my parents." The act was astonishingly easy to put up, especially whilst staring at a version of his parents' true murderer.

"And what if the rumours are true?"

"What rumours?"

"I'm sure at least Black has told you. The ones that if Grindelwald's forces are driven back, they might set their sights on England next."

"It would force Grindelwald to finally duel Dumbledore. We might get an end to everything if that happens."

"You perplex me, Pavonis."

His fake name sounded foul on her tongue; he hoped it tasted even worse and that she choked on it. "I didn't think much confused you, Riddle."

"If it were me, I would want to do it myself."

Harry frowned. "Come again?"

"If Grindelwald had killed my parents, I'd make sure I was the one to kill him."

It stunned him the way she said it. It was so matter of fact. There was no doubt or hesitation in her voice. Riddle spoke with complete and total confidence, as though she had no doubt she could kill Gellert Grindelwald.

Harry's frown deepened. "You know what you're saying, don't you? They call Grindelwald the most powerful dark wizard ever. I think my parents would rather I stayed alive, personally."

Riddle shrugged. "I'd have no intention of losing."

"You make that sound so simple."

"Motivation is an extremely powerful tool. I've learned to use it well and I would make sure I had everything I needed to win." She fixed him with a pointed look. "I never once said I would fight Grindelwald on his terms --- only that I would kill him."

"We'll cross that bridge when we get there. I don't think I'll be ready to kill Grindelwald any time soon."

"Your relationship with your parents was never the strongest, was it?"

If Riddle's first question had taken Harry aback, this one nearly knocked him from his chair due to the whiplash it caused. "What?"

"You seem detached. For most people, living or dying would be an afterthought. It would be about vengeance." She raised a single eyebrow. "Don't you want that?"

Harry felt the blush rise and tried to fight it, but he could feel it invading his cheeks despite his best efforts. "Well... taking revenge only works if I can win."

"You're a very interesting contradiction."

"Am I?" Harry asked, still flustered.

"You are. I'd like to commend you on such pragmatic thinking. I would like to sit here and say how you're the perfect Slytherin for thinking that way, but you're not."

"Seems pretty cunning to me."

"There's more to the house than cunning. You seem to have a complete lack of ambition. If it was me, I would never rest. I would destroy myself in the pursuit of destroying him, but I don't see that fire in your eyes. I don't feel that energy around you. I think you care very little whether Grindelwald lives or dies." She twirled a lock of shining black hair around a long pale finger. Harry had noticed before she did this often while thinking but now, there was a childish air about it. Riddle was amused; perhaps she thought she was toying with him just as easily. "Or perhaps you just want to hide in the hope that others do your work for you."

Harry felt his temper rise, but he fought hard to keep it in check. This must be Riddle's plan. She must have hoped to provoke him into a fight. It wasn't going to work --- he had three years of dealing with the likes of Snape and Malfoy under his belt; Riddle's antagonism could compare to neither of them.

"Or maybe you just don't have everyone figured out as well as you think you do," Harry bit back as he stood to his feet. "Well," he said just short of the door, pausing to glance at Riddle over his shoulder. Her dark eyes had followed him to the door. "I think you know you don't understand me, and I think that fact makes you mental. Between the two of us, Riddle, you'll have to try harder than that to make progress."

***November 28, 1942***

***Hogsmeade***

***12:12 PM***

Harry had almost forgotten about the little village by the time the notice for the year's first Hogsmeade excursion went up in mid-November. They were usually once per month, but the outings had been postponed after the attack on Diagon Alley. Everyone wanted to wait and see whether Grindelwald struck again.

There had been no attacks ever since, so Armando Dippett and the Hogwarts Board of Governors had finally given their stamps of approval and the first expedition was set.

The wind bit at Harry, Elena, and Dorea as they traipsed their way down the sloping lawns and made for one of the carriages. There had been several light snowfalls as of late, but they left little more than a faint dusting behind that gave way quickly and left nothing behind but damp, dying blades of grass. Everyone knew winter was coming; the weather was making sure no one forgot. Harry heard Elena's teeth chatter from beside him as they climbed into their carriage. Her travelling cloak was pulled so tightly around her that Harry thought it must be cutting off circulation as their carriage began to move.

The sky above was a dull, unrelenting grey. The sun had no hope of poking through the oppressive veil, but neither rain nor snow seemed any closer to falling, so Harry supposed things could be much worse.

Leaving the castle's grounds via carriage had been odd. Harry had always snuck to Hogsmeade via the secret passage under the humpbacked statue of the one-eyed witch. He had considered doing that again today, but Harry feared Riddle might be watching him and that was a secret he was unwilling to give away so casually.

If that had been a bit strange, Hogsmeade itself was completely foreign. The Three Broomsticks was still there, which was no surprise. Harry had heard people say that it was as old as the village itself and that Hogsmeade's founder had dwelled there during medieval times. The other, less savoury establishment --- the Hog's Head --- also appeared to be standing as battered and sullen as ever, but the similarities ended there.

No Shrieking Shack stood weathered and decrepit atop its lush green hill. Harry had expected that, but it was still strangely disappointing. That fabled ruin had given the village splendour it otherwise lacked and it was far from the only thing missing.

Honeydukes was there, but it was different. The place looked as though it had seen better days judging by the peeling paint and thin coating of dust that had resembled the light snow the previous day before it had melted away. Zonko's was there too, but it was closed.

"It's because of the war," said Elena. "My parents say it hurts business."

"I'll bet it did," said Dorea. "Nobody but the noble families have money to spend and most of them don't go looking around in Zonko's."

Harry had been looking forward to this trip, but it was not what he had been hoping for. He had sought an escape from the castle, a respite from Riddle\'s ever-watchful gaze, and a reminder of something pure and joyful.

What he got was a slap in the face and a hard reminder of exactly what he had stumbled into. This quaint little village had been touched just as deeply by the war as Diagon Alley, but this one was sadder for Harry. It hit closer to home somehow.

His mind thought back to the conversations he had shared with Dorea and Riddle about Grindelwald and Stalingrad. Harry was much less sure whether what he had told Riddle he was hoping for had been the truth. If Dumbledore was going to defeat Grindelwald anyway, did it really matter? The last thing Harry wanted was tons of wreckage in England. The war had barely touched the country's wizarding population and yet still it left ruin in its nonexistent wake. Harry could scarcely imagine what would become of places like Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley if Britain bore the full brunt of Grindelwald's onslaught. He thought back to reading about the Blitz in muggle history class. It had shaped a generation of their countrymen and changed Britain forever. Harry shuddered to think what the wizarding equivalent of that might look like.

It was a relief to step inside the Three Broomsticks. Nothing had changed in fifty years inside this establishment. Nothing except that Madam Rosmerta was nowhere to be seen and was quite possibly not yet born. Harry had felt strangely disappointed at that. Her replacement was an older woman who did not quite carry Rosmerta's luster.

Elena nudged Dorea once the trio had sat down. "He's looking at you again," she whispered. Harry was confused until he followed the two girls' stares.

There was indeed a boy looking directly at Dorea and the sight of him made Harry's heart lurch. His hair was dark and tousled, his eyes were warm and blazed with strange emotion that Harry couldn't place, and his face --- Merlin, it was familiar.

Harry recognized him at once. He was the same boy who had taken Myrtle off to the hospital wing the night Aragog attacked. The same boy who Dumbledore had swiftly called upon, the same boy who made Harry feel like he was looking in a broken mirror if he ignored the eyes, and the same boy whom he had once seen staring out at him through a very different kind of mirror.

Dorea blushed. "I wish he wouldn't," she muttered. "I don't know what he's after."

Elena giggled. "Really? I think it's pretty obvious."

Dorea glared. "If that's it, then he's an idiot. He must know that's not how it works with the Blacks."

Harry had looked away, but he felt the boy's eyes on him this time and he looked back. The expression was strange. It was... tight somehow. Like it caused Charlus physical pain to look at him, but also like he couldn't bring himself to look away.

Harry tried not to show how fast his heart was beating when he raised a questioning eyebrow. Charlus's expression smoothed out like the surface of a lake when its ripples disappeared and he nodded curtly.

Harry watched his grandfather even after the man had turned away. There was something odd about that whole thing. From the expressions he had worn to the words shared between Elena and Dorea. Harry would have to watch his grandfather, though something made him hesitate to do more than that.

The universe had a funny way of spoiling nice things anytime Harry sought them out. It was best not to tempt it by making true advances.

"Are you all right, Harry?" Elena asked, pulling him from his stupor. The waitress who wasn't quite as pretty as Madam Rosmerta had arrived and she and the other two girls were looking at Harry with expectant expressions.

He shook himself with some difficulty. "Yeah, sorry, spaced out for a minute. I'll take a butterbeer, please."

***The Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom***

***1:18 PM***

Professor Merrythought did many things very well. Harry thought one of her best and most infuriating qualities was her affinity for keeping students on their toes at all times.

She never seemed to schedule the days on which students would duel --- they just happened. All the class knew was that those days would be once every month.

Today was supposedly set to be Harry's third duel. He had taken great pleasure in trouncing Mulciber during the first. Beating the Crabbe girl had been less satisfying, but imagining her as Malfoy's lackey fifty years in the future had certainly served as its own kind of motivation.

Now, it was time for the class to duel again --- the final time it would happen before the fast-approaching winter break.

That was something that had been plaguing Harry often as of late.

The Fawleys had invited him to return to their home in just under two weeks' time for the winter holidays, but Harry was torn. In his own time, that would never have been a question. Hogwarts was his home and that would have been the end of it.

Yet, this was not his own time.

Both Elena and Dorea were returning home for the winter break, as were most of the castle's inhabitants. It was especially pronounced in Slytherin, where most of the students had important families to return home to.

Two of the only students left in the castle would be Harry and Riddle --- a prospect the raven-haired youth dreaded.

*"Just come home with me,"* Elena had told him time and time again. *"It's the perfect way for you to avoid her."*

*"I'm with Elena,"* Dorea said every time the conversation was raised. *"There's something about the way she looks at you... it's unnatural."*

Harry wanted badly to listen to them. They were preaching what was best for him and he knew it. Staying inside the castle next to alone with Riddle was like poking one's head into the fire without floo powder and hoping for the best. It was ludicrous.

Yet Harry feared it was the only way.

Harry still somehow feared that Riddle would take control of Cerastes despite all the snake had been doing for Harry. That fear would only swell if he left the castle. It would give Riddle the perfect opening and if Harry was nowhere to be seen for weeks, that would be the most plausible time for Cerastes to switch sides.

He felt a strange duty to stop Riddle's plans involving the Chamber of Secrets. Perhaps it was because he knew Hagrid and did not wish for him to be expelled again. Perhaps it was because after seeing what Myrtle was in life, Harry dreaded seeing her reduced to what she had been in death. Or perhaps it was something else altogether. His feelings towards Riddle or even that damned nobility that had gotten him into trouble so many times.

Harry had no idea what it was, but it was making his decision regarding the winter break extremely difficult. That was unhelpful, for the deadline was approaching fast and Harry had only days to make his final decision.

"Your partners for this month's rounds," Harry heard Merrythought call as if from far away. Tuning back into the class and conversation was much more difficult than it ought to have been. Harry missed the first number of pairs, but he caught a name that interested him and finally jolted him back into the swing of things. "Riddle, you'll duel Crabbe." Harry saw the big girl pale. He couldn't blame her. Riddle had made easy work of both Parkinson and Rosier in her first two duels. "Pavonis," Merrythought went on, "you'll duel Dolohov."

Antonin Dolohov...

Next to Riddle, it was probably the worst draw Harry could have gotten. Rosier and Black were both talented, but Dolohov had exceptional technical prowess and he was the most vicious of all of them. He had pushed Merrythought's rules in both of his first two duels. Harry knew this was going to be very unlike his duels with both Crabbe and Mulciber. This time, he was really in a fight.

Harry met Dolohov's shark-eyed stare and the boy nodded curtly. It was clear that Harry wasn't the only one who realized he was in for a fight.

He pondered the upcoming duel as Alphard Black took his stance across from his sister, Cassiopeia. Alphard was the odd Black out for Harry. He reminded Harry more of a Malfoy than a Black. He was too quiet to ever be a Malfoy, but he was a smooth talker and lacked the aura the other members of the Black family seemed to carry around. Harry certainly did not expect him to be competitive in a duel against Cassiopeia.

He realized within the first number of seconds that he was right and refocused on his own upcoming task. He would never have given himself a chance against Dolohov early in the year, but now... things had changed.

Dolohov was definitely better than Elena and there was probably a meaningful gap between the two of them. Outside of Riddle, he was known as one of the best duellists at Hogwarts. The only other more vaunted was Charlus Potter. Many people feared Arcturus Black, but not necessarily in that way, though Harry had little doubt he was skillful.

Yet he had been improving rapidly himself. The gap between him and Elena was widening. She had beaten him often enough early in the year, but that hadn't happened in ages. Not since he had been distracted after seeing the Unforgivable Curses had Elena wrested his wand from him or otherwise incapacitated him. Now, their duels were hardly competitive and Harry was beginning to worry he would need a new sparring partner if he was to continue improving at the same pace.

Harry almost jumped at the scream as Alphard toppled backwards and slammed hard against the classroom's floor. Harry could smell burning flesh and hear Merrythought giving Cassiopeia a lecture of sorts, but the female Black waved her off and countered the curse with what seemed like minimal effort. Alphard was still cursing and wincing when he got to his feet, but Harry didn't fail to notice the way Cassiopeia practically glowed as she walked back to Riddle.

Harry doubted he was a better technical duellist than Dolohov. The boy was not only a year older --- he had been duelling for much longer than Harry,

He thought back to Dolohov's previous two duels. There hadn't been a whole lot of movement. Dolohov had stayed quite stationary in both duels and just defended with magic. Rosier had moved much more than Dolohov and it had given him problems. Harry was faster than either of them and moved often, so he at least had that going for him.

Mulciber's body hit the floor as Parkinson summoned the fallen boy's wand with an immensely smug air about her. It was incredible how she had been so utterly helpless against Riddle, but against Mulciber, she looked like a polished duellist who was skilled and well-practiced. Mulciber just looked livid --- he had lost all three of the mock duels.

Elena had always said Harry had a strange ability to cast magic faster than anyone she had ever seen. Harry remembered thinking the same thing about Riddle and wondered whether their duelling styles were similar. She was immensely powerful, but Elena had complained many times that her shields seemed less effective against Harry than they were against most other people.

*"Even you must have noticed. Both half bloods, orphans, raised by muggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself. We even look something alike."*

Tom Riddle's words still haunted him even now, but perhaps in this instance, they could be of some use.

"Pavonis, Dolohov, you're up!"

Dolohov was tall, but thin. This was the first time Harry had been so close to him. Merrythought had the curtains drawn so the room was lit only by torches. Dolohov's pale skin looked waxy in this light but his eyes glinted with the malicious intent Harry knew he carried. This was not Mulciber nor Crabbe. This would be the single most dangerous opponent Harry had ever duelled. He prepared himself for that reality as he could feel Merrythought's call coming, the spell building on the tip of Dolohov's wand...

"Begin!"

Harry leapt to his right in the nick of time. A jet of purple light from Dolohov's wand sailed right past him. Harry cast four successive Stunners at top speed, forcing Dolohov to shield and take a step back. Harry fired a Blasting Curse that shattered Dolohov's shield and sent him staggering, but he deflected Harry's next two spells with deft precision before countering with three curses Harry had never seen before.

Their exchanges were so fast, Harry had no time to think. It was instinctual, spell for spell, movement for movement --- Harry loved it. There was something thrilling about this kind of duelling, something thrilling about the pace, the intensity, and the uncertain outcome. Every part of him seemed to be humming as he dodged, shielded, and even deflected some of Dolohov's spells. That was a trick Harry had spent the better part of a month learning. Dolohov did it with far more grace than him, but he was improving and Harry could tell Dolohov had expected the duel to end sooner and that he was surprised he still had a live opponent fighting back.

Dolohov snarled as Harry forced him backwards with three quick spells before deflecting Harry's next offering and lunging forward, lashing out with another curse Harry had never seen before. Harry dove sideways and rolled, avoiding the next spell that he knew would come. He was on his feet again, shielding one spell, dodging another, leaning just out of the way of a third, and countering with his own barrage.

He heard the hiss of pain as a Cutting Curse sliced through Dolohov's robes and created a wound on his left shoulder. Harry wished he would have gotten Dolohov's wand arm, but it would do --- it was first blood.

Something had changed in the boy's expression the second he had been wounded. A light blazed behind his eyes that Harry had not seen there before. If it had been there during either of Dolohov's first two duels, Harry had missed it. It was wild; the kind of look one would expect from a predator backed into a corner.

Harry almost startled at Dolohov's next barrage. He recognized the first two curses, though they came so fast that Merrythought likely did not. The first would weaken the skin of the affected area to dangerous levels and the second was a Cutting Curse. Combined, they could do horrific amounts of damage.

Now it was Harry's expression that changed. Dolohov had upped the stakes significantly, Harry thought as he dodged, watching Dolohov's wand follow him but his feet stay in place.

It was like Harry had expected. His biggest advantage was speed, both in casting and in movement. His spells seemed more powerful, too, but Dolohov was not as easily overwhelmed by that as Elena.

At least not yet.

Dolohov was extremely aggressive. One spell flowed perfectly into the next and his selection was near perfect. Everything had a purpose and was handpicked for the situation. They were all deadly accurate and every single one of his spells carried malicious intent.

But defensively?

He relied on minimal movement, admittedly excellent reflexes, and magical shields. None of them allowed him to switch the tide of a duel very quickly. Putting Dolohov on his back foot was a nightmare, but when Harry did, it stayed that way for some time. Dolohov was excellent at closing openings, but Harry was beginning to realize that his biggest fault as a duellist was that he had no gift for *creating* openings.

One of Dolohov's spells grazed Harry's ribs and he winced. Heat flared up in the target area, but he had been fortunate. He unleashed a torrent of magic towards Dolohov as fast as he could and forced him on the defensive. Then he opened up, raining down spell after spell on Dolohov, whose shield was buckling under the onslaught. Harry pressed harder and harder until the shield shattered. Dolohov was finally forced to move, lunging sideways and rolling with considerably less grace than Harry. Another Cutting Curse tore into him, this time slicing a wider cut in his leg. More magic was soaring towards him by the time he took to his feet, but he fired off one spell towards Harry before diving out of the way again.

"Expello Viscera!"

Harry almost gasped aloud. He knew that curse only from finding a hideous book in the Fawleys' library. It was the Entrail-Expelling Curse and it did exactly what it sounded like. He could hardly believe it. He knew Dolohov was vicious, but this? This would be murder in a classroom and in front of witnesses all because of what? Because Harry had given him two wounds that would be easily healed? Because he refused to lose in front of his peers? Or perhaps because he refused to lose in front of Riddle?

"That's enough!" Merrythought called as Harry sidestepped, but he paid her no heed.

Harry slashed his wand and bellowed his own incantation, sending a blazing stream of fire towards Dolohov, whose eyes widened as he lunged out of the way.

"I said enough!" screamed Merrythought as Harry and Dolohov began trading curses at top speed once more.

Harry was back to not thinking. Shield, lean, counter, deflect, counter, offence, step back, shield, lean, counter, dodge, dodge, counter, offence, shield, roll, shield, dodge, deflect, counter...

*BANG!*

Harry didn't remember falling to the floor, but he remembered the earth-shaking sound and he remembered lying there, looking up at the ceiling and the torches on the wall as his vision swam. He raised a hand to his head, but felt nothing. There were no bruises, no cuts, no signs of damage at all.

His vision was slowly clearing and the ringing in his ears was fading as he began to put together what had happened just as he saw the truth of it.

Riddle was standing there, her wand still held almost delicately up in a ready position as her eyes flicked between Harry and Dolohov. Her spell had knocked down both of them and she had clearly acted at the behest of Professor Merrythought.

Harry could see that Lestrange was helping Dolohov to his feet and he tensed, worried the boy might attack him again.

Then, Riddle was by him, swift as the wind, and offered him a hand up. The idea of touching her was vile, but the room still spun and the idea of letting her spell keep him down for so long was worse. Her hand was colder than Harry thought it ought to have been as she helped pull him up and steadied him with her other hand on his back. He shuddered as ripples of cold seemed to spread outwards in a web from where she touched him.

Dolohov had indeed turned unsteadily to face Harry with hatred in his eyes, but all of that had died when he saw who stood near him.

That was all Harry needed to know.

Already, one of the most dangerous students danced to her tune and after that last spell, it was not difficult to see why. It was the most telling thing Harry had learned so far about Emily Riddle.

***Later that night, in an abandoned classroom...***

"So he just... attacked you?" Elena asked when Harry had finished telling the tale of his duel with Dolohov.

"He must have just snapped or something. I don't know "

"That's odd," Dorea muttered.

Harry raised an eyebrow. "Is it?"

"Yes. Dolohov isn't really known for that. Avery, Carrow, Lestrange, Mulciber --- all of them, yes. Dolohov is known as the quiet and controlled one." She fidgeted uncomfortably. "I don't like it."

"What do you mean *it*?" Harry asked.

"I just think there's something else going on and whatever it is, I don't like it."

"Like what?" asked Elena. "What do you think it could be?"

Dorea gestured vaguely. "I don't know. Dolohov is one of Riddle's creatures. He could have done it for her."

"I don't understand why she would want him to try and kill me in a classroom full of witnesses though. Besides, if Riddle wanted to attack me, she's had plenty of chances when I've been alone with her."

"Maybe she didn't want to do it."

Harry waved her off. "Doesn't matter --- could have led me into an ambush or something. Point is, it makes no sense to have Dolohov attack me like that in class and risk getting expelled."

"Do you have any idea how much trouble he got in?"

"Detention with Merrythought until the end of the year. She was taking him to Dippet, too."

"Like that will do anything," Dorea said with a sneer. It was an expression Harry hadn't seen her wear before, but it reminded him exactly which family she came from. "Dippet is useless and has been for years. His wits left him decades ago."

If this Dippet was the same as the one from Harry's reality, that might actually have been true. He could think of no other way the old man had allowed Riddle to convince him that Hagrid of all people was the Heir of Slytherin.

"Be careful in that class. You're on your own against Riddle and her posse."

"I'll be fine," he assured. "I'm not looking forward to duelling Riddle, but otherwise, I'll be fine."

"There's probably some way out of it," Elena said quietly.

"I'm not afraid of her."

The two girls exchanged glances before Dorea sighed defeatedly. "I guess that means you're going to stay for the break too then, doesn't it?"

Harry nodded, a steely expression fixed in place. "It does, yeah."

"You know, sometimes, there are just some people you *should* be afraid of."

Harry could not help but think they were ominous words, but he ignored them as the trio removed their wands for a night of practice.

***The Great Hall***

***8:51 AM***

That morning, Slughorn finally went from student to student and confirmed who would be staying behind at the castle and who would be returning home for the winter holidays. Harry had decided to stay back despite his real wishes and better judgement. If Riddle made a move on the Chamber of Secrets, he was the only hope.

His two friends were flummoxed as to why Harry would stay behind. It wasn't exactly as though he could tell either of them about the Chamber of Secrets. That would raise too many questions he couldn't answer. Besides, the fewer people knew about it, the better. If Riddle grew desperate enough, she may well try and take the secrets from them either through Legilimency or by more forceful means.

"I would stay back with you if I could," said Dorea. She even sounded like she meant it.

"Why?" asked Harry. "I imagine your family does something interesting for the holidays?"

Dorea's smile showed no mirth. It was all teeth and sharper than any of the swords held by the suits of armour all over the castle. "Interesting's the right word for it. That doesn't always mean it's pleasant."

"Do you get along with the family you have at Hogwarts?" Elena asked tentatively. When Dorea just raised an eyebrow in return, she blushed and looked away. "I just never see you with them."

"I'm close with Arcturus," she said. "Not really with any of the others. Not anymore."

The wording struck Harry as odd as he glanced down the Slytherin table. It sounded like something had happened. The way Slytherins gossiped, Harry was surprised he hadn't heard about it. What with her being a Black and all. They were rather high profile.

Arcturus Black was talking to no one as he ate. His head was low and his eyes were on a book. He always appeared to be much the opposite of what Harry expected from a Black. He was quiet and unassuming as opposed to brash and arrogant. He was alone and aloof as opposed to outgoing and surrounded by flocks of sycophants. The latter, in particular, just struck Harry as odd. Especially with Arcturus being next in line to inherit the Black lordship. Harry would have expected him to spend most of his Hogwarts days forming political alliances based on the little he knew from Slughorn over the summer.

Arcturus Black was an interesting contradiction, but so was Dorea. She was hardly what Harry would have expected from a daughter of the Founding House of Black in her own right.

Didn't that all just sum up his experience so far? Not what he had expected. How much easier this all could have been if he could anticipate everything in advance. That was what one thought of when they imagined travelling back in time, but that had not been Harry's reality. Everything had only become even more uncertain than it had been before the dementors had ruined the lives of his godfather and his best friend.

Harry longed for the contradictions to end. He longed for certainty to reassert itself, or at least for things to become a touch less opaque.

Yet somehow, Harry suspected the questions, confusion, and uncertain tension would only continue as the year drew on. Especially with Riddle making half the house dance on strings as she moved closer and closer to whatever it was she was planning.

***December 11, 1942***

***The Entrance Hall***

***10:44 PM***

Harry's day had been miserable.

Slughorn had announced that morning in Potions that he would be holding another party; this time, to celebrate the holidays. He hadn't thrown one in November, so Harry really ought to have expected it but he hadn't. He had been so caught up in his time with Cerastes, worries about Riddle, and frustration over all the uncertainty that he found himself completely blindsided by the new development.

It really had ruined Harry's day, but there was enough clarity left in his mind not to fall into the same trap he had last time.

The first thing he had done after Potions class was to ask Elena to go with him. This time, he would not be stuck with one of Riddle's cronies because he was too cowardly to ask one of his friends to go with him. This time, he would be prepared and he wouldn't let Riddle use this as another opening to try and take what Harry couldn't let her have.

That had been stressful, but it had gone well. What had gone less well was Dorea. She had been strangely distant all day and largely ignored both Harry and Elena as they went about their business. It was frustrating and reminded Harry of how he and Ron had gone through a falling out with Hermione during their third year. He hadn't been able to understand what Hermione was thinking then, and Dorea's thoughts now were just as elusive to him. He hadn't the foggiest of ideas what had her in such a storming mood. She had been fine at breakfast. Perhaps she too was dreading the Slug Club meeting? Harry had no idea.

And if that wasn't enough, it was Friday, which meant he had Ancient Runes tutoring with Riddle.

This session was tense in a different way. Harry felt... it was hard to describe. He was more nervous than ever, but that wasn't it. There was a certain feeling that came with knowing how easily Riddle had laid him and Dolohov out on Monday. It had been from behind with neither having a chance to defend themselves, but the magic had spoken for itself.

It left an unspoken weight upon the room as they worked their way through the fourth-year Ancient Runes curriculum. Riddle was determined to get Harry to the point at which he could take and pass a mock fourth-year exam before letting the sessions come to an end. Harry was less thrilled by the prospect, but he couldn't deny he was learning much faster with Riddle's help than he would have done without.

"You seem tense," Riddle said when they finished that night.

"It's nothing. It's just been a long week."

Riddle watched him carefully. "If it's about Monday---"

"It isn't," Harry lied, not meeting her eyes. "It's just... been a long week."

"I can sympathize," she said. "It's difficult watching all of my friends return home over the winter break whilst I have nowhere to go."

"You live in an orphanage, right?" Harry knew the answer, but he felt it was right to ask. She had told him over the summer that both of her parents were dead, but she had never actually told him where she lived.

Riddle nodded. "A muggle one, yes. My mother was a witch who died giving birth to me and I never knew my father."

Harry wished Riddle would just go home with one of her lackeys, but he actually wasn't sure she was kidding. Prodigious as she might have been, she had not yet proven herself outside of academics and the fact she was a halfblood leading around a group of the harshest pureblood supremacists in the country. Harry thought there really was a high chance their parents would not take her presence well.

"I'll be staying, too." Harry didn't know what made him say it. He tried to tell himself that it was a warning, a reminder to Riddle that she would have opposition over the break if she tried anything, but part of him didn't think that was it. His voice didn't quite have the bite for it, either. It was too quiet, too soft.

Riddle smiled. "I look forward to it. It would be nice to learn more about you."

It took Harry a moment to realize that Riddle had played him for a fool.

What had he just done?

She had flipped the script so quickly that the room seemed to spin all around him.

He had planned to stay behind in order to be her foil --- the protector of the castle against her many ill wishes.

Now, it felt different. It felt like he was a dog who had growled too loudly and then been put back in its kennel.

Somehow, Harry was going to need to either win back the upper hand or avoid Riddle altogether --- unless she strayed too close to the second floor for his liking.

Looking at the small smile on her lips and the crazed light dancing behind her eyes, Harry thought the latter might be his better option.

**Chapter 15: Failed Intrusions**

***December 13, 1942***

***The Chamber of Secrets***

***10:31 PM***

Harry let out a long, deep breath as he opened his eyes and once again allowed the Chamber of Secrets to swim into view.

**"You are improving,"** hissed Cerastes from behind him.

It was true. The basilisk had been teaching Harry how to sense magic and it was working. Harry was beginning to learn to sense the nature of spells and the like. The snake obviously couldn't cast anything, but it had acute sensory abilities of its own and was passing on the knowledge to Harry. Outside of the Chamber of Secrets was where he had been practicing those skills the most. Trying to guess spells cast in duels before they were fired, trying to gauge what kinds of wards Dorea put up on abandoned classrooms Harry's trio found themselves in, and so on.

The effects were further reaching than just sensing spells. Harry had begun to find casting easier. Magic of his own was the easiest to sense. If Harry miscast a spell, he could usually now determine his error and how to correct it. It allowed him to learn spells faster than he had before, though he longed for the day he would be able to sense the spell's makeup before it left his wand. Cerastes said it would one day come but that it was a skill of great difficulty and he was unsure exactly how long it would take.

**"Slowly,"** Harry hissed back.

**"No. Not so slowly. Faster than I expected."**

**"But you still don't know how long until I'll be able to sense magic before it's cast?"**

**"No. These things cannot be predicted. I would hardly have been surprised by your progression if they could be."**

The snake had Harry there. It did feel like he was progressing quickly. It hadn't for quite some time. It seemed like no progress at all had been made in the first month or so, but since then, his improvements had come more quickly. The problem had been that Harry had a right pain of a time forcing his mind to still. There could be thoughts, but the more it leapt from thought to thought, the harder it was to sense and interpret magic. Getting past that roadblock had been immensely difficult.

**"You seem stressed,"** Cerastes commented.

**"I am,"** Harry admitted.

**"Why?"**

**"The usurper's still watching me. She'll make her move soon, I'm sure of it, but she hasn't yet. It just feels like it's building and building but going absolutely nowhere."**

**"You stress too much. If the usurper had courage, she would have moved already. One who lacks courage is not one to be worried about."**

It was odd hearing this sentiment from Slytherin's monster. With all the enmity between Salazar Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor, it was strange to hear Cerastes praise Gryffindor's values. The snake had said little of Slytherin and until now, Harry had never thought to ask. Perhaps when the time arose, he would. It was an unparalleled opportunity to learn about one of the greatest wizards of all time. If any wisdom came from it, all the better; Harry suspected he would be needing all of it in more in the months and years to come.

**"I think she's just a perfectionist. She won't commit to a plan unless she's sure it'll work. I can feel her watching me any time I'm not looking even though she's an excellent actress."** Harry made a face. **"I still wish this magic sensing could be used to read people."**

**"I have told you that's not how magic works---"**

**"Yes, yes, I know. Magic isn't inside of people. There's no core or any such nonsense. Magic is all around us and witches and wizards are just the conductors. It's only magical creatures like you that have magic as a part of you."**

**"That is right. How do you expect to use your ability to read someone knowing this?"**

**"I don't expect anything. I just wish I could."**

**"Wish? What is wish?"**

Harry cocked his head to the side as he thought. **"Something you want to happen. In this case, something I want to happen even though I know it can't."**

**"That's ridiculous,"** argued Cerastes. **"Why do humans waste their time with these wishes? They accomplish nothing."**

**"They're pleasant to think about sometimes,"** Harry defended.

**"Pathetic. Do not wish --- create. Wishes sound foolish. It sounds like something that somebody who was incapable of creation would spend their time doing."**

This wasn't the first time Harry had to explain something like this to Cerastes. The basilisk was intelligent, but he was still a snake and thought like a snake. They had no place in their minds for abstract things like wishes and dreams. Life was a task to them; one large problem that could only be tackled with a systematic approach.

Harry thought he could have done with some of that thinking during his first three years at Hogwarts. Maybe then he wouldn't have felt so far behind. Maybe then he wouldn't feel so lost. Maybe then he could have prevented the dementor attack and not have wound up here in the first place.

Damnit!

He was wishing again. If Cerastes had anything right, Harry thought it was his stance on wishes. They were pointless and almost always went unanswered. Creation, Cerastes had said? Yes, Harry liked that better.

**"Let's keep going,"** Harry said as he closed his eyes and took a deep calming breath.

**"You are learning,"** Cerastes responded, hissing in a manner more smug than Harry had ever heard before.

***December 14, 1942***

***The Potions Classroom***

***10:30 AM***

Harry was unsurprised when Slughorn held him back after class that Monday morning, but he wished the man hadn't. The classroom was always stifling after a class of brewing and he really hoped the professor would just tell him to come to his office that night instead. Not only were thin streams of sweat rolling slowly down Harry's face like water down a windshield, but breathing in this room was difficult. All the fumes made the air thicker than butter and Harry thought that if he had ever used a snorkel, this would surely have reminded him of that.

"I must say, you are improving with Miss Black," Slughorn started, holding the vial of potion Harry had submitted up to the light as he rolled it back and forth across his palm.

"Thanks. Dorea's been great."

"She's always been good at Potions. Much of her family is, but she has a touch for them unlike even the rest."

"She's patient, too. She doesn't snap and always takes the time to explain things."

"A fine girl." Slughorn set the vial of potion down upon his desk. "Perhaps you might even want to consider her for the party this Friday night."

Harry's stomach gave a nauseating lurch at the thought. Meeting Dorea was one of the best things that had happened since arriving in the past. Not only was she one of his best friends, but there was something special about getting to know his grandmother. That feeling would be shattered very quickly if he got to know her in... more intimate ways. The thought of it made Harry's stomach writhe like a pit of a hundred vipers. This must have been what Ron had felt like in their second year whilst vomiting slugs into Hagrid's great basin.

"We're just friends, sir."

"Of course, of course," Slughorn said with a wave of his hand. "Harry, m'boy, I would never dream of insinuating anything otherwise. Not at all what I meant, not at all."

"What did you mean then, Professor?"

"Just that it would be best if you had a companion again this Friday. I thought Miss Black might be amiable if you didn't plan to go with her cousin again."

Oh, Merlin... Harry had never even considered that last time around. It really was fortunate that he and Cassiopeia had gone together out of nothing more than obligation. If that hadn't been true, Harry wasn't sure he would ever be able to live it down. He would need to bleach every inch of his body before he had any hope of not vomiting every time the thought arose.

"I'm not going with Cassiopeia this time, no."

"See, there you go?" Slughorn frowned. "Young Dorea would be the perfect companion."

"Sir, I already---"

"Or is it because you're hesitant to ask her? Or maybe that the two of you are such good friends? I have noticed you two talking an awful lot these past few weeks."

"We have. We became much closer friends in November."

"Ah, say no more! I can understand completely why you wouldn't want to complicate that dynamic. I would never dream of intruding. No, no, I understand."

Harry felt thoroughly perplexed by now and he felt his lips fall into a frown that likely indicated just that. "What do you mean, sir?"

Slughorn wagged a finger. "Not this time, Harry, not this time. You have played the role of ignorant fool one too many times. The act won't fool me again."

Harry felt his cheeks flush with heat. If only he really had been acting every time Slughorn thought he knew more than he did. "But, sir, I---"

"Would you like me to arrange something for you? I know Emily was kind enough last time, but I would hate to trouble her with such arrangements. Especially not after she failed to find herself a companion of her own last October. It was really quite disappointing. I would be happy to---"

"Professor, I already have someone who I'm going with."

Slughorn looked as though he had been knocked unconscious and had just staggered to his feet. There was a dazed frown on his face and a vacant look in his eyes as though he had not quite understood what Harry had just said.

"Come again, m'boy?"

"I'm already going with someone. I set it up myself this time. I... uh, didn't want to trouble Riddle again, like you said."

Slughorn blinked rapidly three times. "Oh," he said flatly. Harry had expected pride, excitement, or at the very least curiosity. What he had not expected was for Slughorn to look so... dejected.

Harry could not for the life of him understand what had sparked such a reaction. "Is everything all right, Professor?"

"What's that?"

"I was just checking that everything's okay."

"Oh, yes," said Slughorn, his gusto suddenly returning. "Oh yes, everything is quite all right. Just... I've been suffering with the worst headaches as of late. I'm sorry, but I must go and administer a cure. You understand, of course."

Harry glanced back at the classroom door after stepping out into the dungeons. That had been the oddest interaction he had ever shared with Professor Slughorn. That would have been like him saying that one of Malfoy's sneers had been uglier than all the others. It was a monstrous claim to make, but Harry was confident in this one.

If only he had any idea what had actually made Slughorn act so strangely. The headache was clearly nonsense, but what had happened? Had Harry done something wrong? Had he just lost his foremost ally inside the castle?

He let out a long, frustrated breath as he buried his head in his hands. This year's complex troubles never ceased falling upon his shoulders. He felt like Atlas under the impossible weight of the sky and soon, his knees would buckle and he would be painfully crushed under it all if something didn't change.

***December 15, 1942***

***The Transfiguration Classroom***

***1:14 PM***

"I was quite pleased with this class's performance in this term\'s final examination," Dumbledore was saying. "The improvements some of you have demonstrated have been truly remarkable. It warms my heart to see such commitment to such a complex subject and those of you who scored admirably should be very proud."

Dumbledore flicked his wand and the graded tests began handing themselves out. It had become less odd seeing Dumbledore behind a teacher's desk twice a week, but it was still jarring on occasion. Times like this, when he handed back tests and praised the class for their commitment to his subject. Especially with the sunlight streaming through the window and making his auburn hair and beard look even more vivid. That was something Harry would never get used to. Dumbledore would have his silvery hair and beard again by the time the auburn looked anything short of otherworldly.

Harry looked down at his test and smiled. A perfect score. Hermione would scarcely have believed it.

It turned out that Harry was really quite good at Transfiguration once he'd found what worked for him. It really should have come as no surprise. Harry had heard for three years how gifted James Potter had been. In the Shrieking Shack, he had even learned how he had become an illegal Animagus alongside Peter Pettigrew and Sirius Black.

Harry had begun to wonder about that lately. His improvements here had been staggering. They had been more rapid than even in duelling or magic sensing. Harry was breezing through the curriculum and wished he could skip ahead here as well. He knew it would never happen and that Slughorn and Merrythought had made a very special exception, but he didn't mind too much.

Dumbledore had caught onto his improvements early on and begun giving him more and more challenging tasks that focused on larger transfigurations or finer details. The Transfiguration professor had been as big a part of Harry's growth in the subject as he had. Harry held no ill will towards Professor McGonagall, but he had never seen her help a student as much as Dumbledore had helped Harry. He really was a remarkable teacher and Harry had considered asking him what it would take to become an Animagus.

It would need to be done in a way that wouldn't arouse Dumbledore's suspicion. That was the difficult part. How did one deceive somebody as brilliant and as perceptive as Dumbledore? The ministry would never allow Harry to become an Animagus --- not for many years and not without sufficient qualifications --- so he would have to do it illegally if he wanted to do it before he was middle-aged.

That was not to say Harry was delusional. He knew he was now beyond fourth-year level in regards to Transfiguration, but he was just as aware that he was miles away from being able to become an Animagus. The thought just cropped up the more and more he thought of Riddle duelling in Merrythought's class. She was so far ahead of him it was laughable. That gap was closing, but would it close fast enough? If she rose to become Lady Voldemort, Harry was going to need every advantage he could get. He was reasonably sure Voldemort had never been an Animagus. That would be one weapon she would never expect. Though, with his luck, he would end up as a rodent or some nonsense. It would be typical --- for Harry to spend years developing a new weapon against Voldemort that only makes it easier for her to kill him if he ever used it.

"I am very pleased with the way you have performed this term, Master Pavonis."

Harry looked up and met those piercing blue eyes that were all too familiar. "Thank you, Professor."

"I have rarely taught anyone with your talent and I'm happy to see it is not wasted on you. I'm aware the scope of this class doesn't challenge you, but come to me at any time if you would like to make swifter improvements. The work would be extensive, but I would be happy to nudge you in the right direction with some supplementary material as well as answering any questions you might have."

Harry's heart stopped for a moment. Had Albus Dumbledore just offered to teach him magic?

Then, the muscle soared into his throat when he realized that was exactly what had just happened. The greatest wizard in the world --- the man who was destined to defeat Gellert Grindelwald in less than three years' time --- had just offered to privately teach Harry magic!

His face split into a broad grin. "I appreciate it, Professor. I'll be taking you up on it as soon as possible."

Dumbledore smiled. That was another thing Harry was not yet used to. Certain expressions worn by the old man not being marred by the lines of age.

"Come and see me after the winter break has concluded. I would be happy to discuss it all with you then."

"Aren't you just everyone's golden boy?" Dorea asked in Harry's ear once Dumbledore moved away.

She had become more talkative again in the past number of days after giving both Harry and Elena the cold shoulder for reasons the former still couldn't put together. It seemed that Dorea had been unable to keep up the act. It was funny, actually, to think that a daughter of House Black had been unable to keep up a cold and aloof persona.

"You can call me whatever you want if it means I get extra Transfiguration practice with Dumbledore." Dorea's expression changed to something more calculating and Harry's eyes narrowed. "What is it?"

She looked around before idly flicking her wand and bringing up what Harry felt was a privacy ward. It was a powerful one. The magic felt thick and unyielding. Not hostile. It probably wouldn't lash out if anyone got too close, but it would prevent them from hearing anything and potentially even warn Dorea. Harry was only guessing at that last part; he had no idea what kind of sensation would indicate that.

"Dumbledore's never liked Riddle," Dorea said in a hushed whisper as Elena leant her own head in to hear. "She's apparently gone off about it in the common room once or twice. It must have been during her first year because I've only heard about it, but everyone knows it."

"He did seem a bit short with her after she fought off the spider," Harry said, feigning thoughtfulness as his heartbeat quickened. This could be the kind of information he needed.

"He's always been like that," said Elena. "It's weird. Riddle is... Riddle, but Dumbledore's always seemed to like everyone."

"He's a genius who isn't fooled by someone just because they're charming and brilliant," said Dorea. "Dumbledore probably tried the same thing at Hogwarts and saw through Riddle from the beginning."

Harry had never thought of it that way. Riddle had said in the Chamber of Secrets that Dumbledore had never been fooled by his persona, but Harry had never wondered why. Dumbledore was Dumbledore and that was all the explanation he had needed. Though it was a bit strange how someone who fooled almost everyone failed so utterly to fool the person who she should want to trick the most. Dumbledore was the last enemy Harry would want to make if he were in Riddle's position.

"That's all really interesting," said Elena, "but what does it have to do with Harry?"

Harry might have asked the same question, but he had been content to let Dorea ramble about Riddle. The more information about her, the better. Harry was starving for something that might renew his confidence in the cold war the two of them were waging.

"Well, everyone knows Riddle is brilliant with magic. Maybe the best the school has ever seen. Slughorn says she'll go on to become the greatest sorcerer in the world. This time, I'm not sure it's just him saying something outlandish for the sake of saying something outlandish."

"And you don't think Dumbledore wants Riddle to become that?" asked Elena.

"Exactly."

"Wait a minute," said Harry, "so you're telling me you think Dumbledore wants to... what? Train me to be Riddle's equal, or something?"

Dorea's lips curved upwards into a small smile. "No, I don't think that's right."

"But you just said---"

"A man like Albus Dumbledore would never settle for equal. I think he wants to train you to be better."

***December 18, 1942***

***Horace Slughorn's Office***

***9:23 PM***

Harry was much more comfortable this time around than he had been during Samhain. Much of that had to do with Elena. Having her at the party and with him at all times was a relief. Dorea was a part of the Slug Club too and was unaccompanied, so she sat with Harry and Elena for most of the outing.

Yet that wasn't all.

Everything Harry knew about Emily Riddle told him that she wouldn't try the same thing twice. He still watched her, but not as closely. There wasn't the same panic there had been at Samhain. There wasn't the same looming dread every time the girl's eyes so much as flicked towards the office's door.

The room itself had been expanded for the evening and it was well-decorated. The carpet was pure white and enchanted so that it rippled under one's feet to simulate the snow outside. The torches had all been replaced by candles made from ice. The carpet sparkled in the candlelight, glittering like a thousand pale gemstones reflecting warm and vibrant sunlight. The sound of wind whistled through the room even though there was no biting chill to speak of. There were other things too; holly, mistletoe, and other plants Harry had never even seen before. Evergreen garland draped about the room so that it seemed to be everywhere. Slughorn really had gone all out, not that anyone was at all surprised.

Harry was again introduced to a crowd of important people, but it was more bearable this time with Elena by his side. Despite Slughorn having not invited her, she was recognized by many of the people who met her and Harry.

*"Your grandfather is a great man,"* one especially old wizard told her.

*"If I had my way,"* another had said, *"Lord Fawley would still be the Minister for Magic."*

It was quite some time before the two of them were able to extricate themselves from the gaggle of people and make their way back towards the first table not teeming with people that they found.

"What a lovely surprise. Good evening, Harry. You as well, Elena."

Harry's blood ran cold and he watched as Elena's face lost some of its colour. They had been so lackadaisical about which table they chose that they had wound up sitting with Riddle. It also hadn't helped that the crowd around them had been so thick, Harry had lost track of her.

Elena glanced at Harry with wary eyes, but he was looking at Riddle. Appearances were more important now. "Evening, Riddle. Have you had your turn as Slughorn's trophy yet?"

"Oh, yes," she said with a small smile. "I'm sure I'll have another round before the night is done. Perhaps he'll even show us off together. He seemed fond of that last time."

"He did, yeah. The man finds pleasure in odd things."

"Not so odd, I don't think. He's very high on both of us. It's only natural that he wants to establish a positive connection before we make it in the world."

Harry would have admired the sureness in Riddle's voice had it been anyone else speaking, but it meant little from her. Of course *she* was going to make it in the world. It wasn't a show of confidence, just a display of common sense.

"I suppose, I've never been much for showing off."

Elena watched the exchange between Harry and Riddle with wide eyes. Harry supposed she had never seen anyone keep up with Riddle like this. She must have underestimated what spending three months in abandoned classrooms together had accomplished.

"No, it never has been your style. I remember how uncomfortable you looked at the beginning of the year when everyone asked about your parents and your history."

It was strangely specific phrasing. Harry thought it almost sounded planned and he could not help but glance at Riddle's face.

That was when it happened.

A lance of pain erupted behind Harry's eyes and darted across the inside of his skull like a leaping shadow. Riddle had done something, but Harry wasn't sure what... until it clicked.

Legilimency --- she had just tried to use Legilimency against him! It must have failed because she had obviously tried to take information protected by his mother's sacrifice.

Riddle pulled back at once, grimacing and gasping as she pressed a palm flat against her forehead. Cassiopeia was beside her and she turned to Riddle at once before glaring at Harry and reaching for her wand.

"Put it away, Cassiopeia."

It was a new voice that spoke. Harry had never heard it before; it was deep yet sharp and cut across the chaos like a rowers oar across a smooth lake's surface.

The voice belonged to a boy who Harry recognized at once. He had black hair and grey eyes so dark they were almost of the same colour. High cheekbones, a sharp nose, and a strong jaw completed the regal visage of the boy who Harry knew as the Heir of the Founding House of Black.

"Arcturus---"

"I said put it away!"

Cassiopeia shoved the wand up her sleeve, but she scowled at Arcturus before turning back towards Riddle. "Emily, are you---"

"I'm perfectly all right," Riddle said with an attempt at an easy smile. "I somehow managed to bite down hard on my tongue. I blame the wine."

Arcturus snorted. "I'd be careful biting into that if I were you. We wouldn't want all the poison in it leaking into the rest of you. It would be a real travesty."

"Thank you for your concern, Heir Black, but I think I'll be just fine."

"If you keep to yourself and stop trying to invade others' privacy, I'm sure you will." The tall seventh-year boy turned towards Harry. "Pavonis, I'd like a word."

Harry stood. There was hardly anything else to do. The last sight he caught of his friends was of Dorea, watching the pair of them with suspicious eyes.

"What is it you want with my sister?" Arcturus asked once they had left the room and slipped into one far more isolated.

"What?" Harry asked, taken aback.

"Dorea. What is it you want with her?"

"Nothing. We're friends, that's it."

Arcturus studied his face carefully. "You have no intention of changing that?"

"None."

Slowly, he nodded and extended a hand. "Arcturus Black. I would say it's always a pleasure to make the acquaintance of someone who bests Riddle, but it doesn't happen enough for me to know."

That was the best thing Arcturus could have said if he wanted to gain Harry's trust. "Hadrian Pavonis, but Merlin, just call me Harry. I'm happy to meet anyone who likes watching Riddle get shown up."

Arcturus grinned. There was no mirth in the expression --- it was all teeth. "So long as you keep your word about my sister, I think we might just be able to get along."

**Chapter 16: Ominous Gifts**

***December 21, 1942***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***10:44 PM***

It was the third day of the winter break and Harry thought it had been going well thus far. Most of it had been spent with him locked up in the Chamber of Secrets. Not only did this mean he was progressing in sensing magic faster than ever before, but it also meant he had scarcely encountered Riddle.

It was perfect.

Being down in the chamber meant that he would know if she made a move, but it also kept him out of her line-of-fire so long as she didn't. It was the perfect balance, especially considering both of Harry's closest friends had returned home for the winter break.

There was no way Riddle hadn't caught on. Harry could tell she was looking at him every time he was in her vicinity, but that was hardly new. He never returned her stare to see what lurked behind her eyes, but he had little doubt it would confirm the fact that she knew what he was doing.

This was why he had picked now to lurk the halls. Curfew had passed and Harry knew that Riddle had no obligatory rounds as a prefect this evening. He would be able to wander the castle in peace without her lurking around a shadowy corner and waiting to ambush him with her company.

Harry remembered one of the first times he had ever truly gone exploring the castle. During the winter break of his first year, when he had opened a screaming book and been chased so far from the library that he had lacked any idea of where he was. That had been the night Harry had discovered the Mirror of Erised. He wondered as he walked what he would see if he looked into that enchanted mirror now. Would it still be his family smiling out at him? Perhaps with Ron, Hermione, and maybe even Sirius standing among their number?

Harry didn't realize his legs were carrying him towards that classroom until he was nearly there. It had been a long time since he had stood in that room, but he was likely never to forget it. He paused for a moment. The mirror had only been at Hogwarts as a protective measure against Voldemort as far as he knew. It surely wouldn't be here now; there was no reason to tread towards this long-forgotten room.

Yet something compelled Harry to keep walking. It was irrational. It was true that abandoned classrooms were better for certain kinds of spell practice than the Chamber of Secrets, but by that logic, he should have used the room he always occupied with Dorea and Elena; the one he had warded so many times that doing so had become as simple as breathing by now.

Harry wondered minutes later if the pull towards this room had been some kind of premonition as he heard sounds off in the distance and tensed. They were loud sounds that cut through the night's silence as sharply as a well-honed blade. They were more than familiar. Harry had heard similar sounds often enough during mock duels against Elena earlier in the year. The distinctive sounds the desks made in those empty rooms when one of the combatants dodged a stray spell that careened into the forgotten furniture and splintered it into a thousand pieces.

Harry listened closer but was sure he was right. He loathed not knowing the Disillusionment Charm just then. His curiosity had been piqued. Never before had he wandered the halls of Hogwarts and heard anything that sounded like this. If nothing else, Harry wondered who exactly was duelling, or who was venting their anger upon the poor, innocent furniture.

There was another charm, Harry thought as he drew closer to the source of the sounds. The Notice-Me-Not Charm was one he had read about not too long ago while researching ahead in the subject that had been taught by Professor Flitwick in his own time. It was no invisibility spell, but it was said to make one go unnoticed so long as they did nothing blatantly obvious that would dispel the illusion. The problem was that Harry had never exactly tried casting the spell.

He bit his lip as he crept closer and closer to the classroom from which the noise was coming. The Sorting Hat might have placed him in Slytherin this time around, but Harry still thought he was a Gryffindor through and through when it counted. Bold curiosity gripped him now; the kind that would have made most others wearing green and silver sneer.

"Homenum Revelio," he muttered as he neared the classroom door. This was a spell he had become much more adept at since his initial attempt that first week with Riddle had hardly stretched out ten feet.

There was one person in the classroom and it seemed as though they had not yet noticed Harry. Probably because they were moving so loudly and sporadically. Harry was confident it wasn't Riddle. She would never have been the type to practice somewhere easy to stumble upon. His mind raced through other options, but they were all no longer in the castle. Elena had gone home and if she had been practicing, Harry would have been with her. Dolohov did seem the type, as did someone like Romulus Lestrange, but both of them had returned to their families --- Riddle was the only student from her group remaining at Hogwarts over the winter break.

There was no reason to peek through the door, yet Harry found himself reaching for it nevertheless. His hand paused a few inches from it as his other twirled his wand.

"Inobservata."

The incantation was whispered almost hesitantly and with low expectations, but Harry felt the spell take effect almost at once. That was another thing about learning to sense magic --- he could tell very quickly whether or not his spells had worked.

This one had, to his great surprise, and he glanced one final time at the door before tentatively reaching for its handle. Years of practice on Privet Drive allowed him to push it soundlessly open just wide enough for a single eye to peek through and spot who was inside.

Harry hadn't had any expectations but if he had, this would not have been it.

For a moment, he thought he was dreaming before his brain caught up and his eye noticed that the figure in the room did look somewhat different to him despite the striking similarities. It was the hair that got Harry. It was plastered across Charlus's sweat-soaked forehead in the same way it always was when Harry exerted himself. The same strands splayed out as most of the hair parted the same way, falling in a large ebony splash across the left side of Charlus's forehead. The only difference was that his raven hair did not cover a once world-famous scar, but from this angle, it was hardly as though Harry could tell.

"Who's there?"

Harry's blood froze as Charlus paused in mid stride and whirled towards the door. Harry knew he had two choices. The Notice-Me-Not Charm had broken the second Charlus realized someone was there, but only a single eye poked through the door and Harry could withdraw faster than Charlus could turn around. Whether the boy would give chase or not was an entirely different dilemma, but Harry was confident he knew enough secret passages to escape the older Potter if it came to that.

The question was whether or not he wanted to escape. This would be the chance to speak to his grandfather --- a chance he suddenly realized he had been hoping would arrive for some time. Ever since Samhain night, when he had spotted Charlus before he had been ushered off by Dumbledore. Even more since they had exchanged a glance in the Three Broomsticks during the first Hogsmeade trip of the school year.

It was a difficult decision. Harry yearned to step into the room, but he feared what would happen if he did. Harry wasn't sure he would have taken it well had someone been eavesdropping on him, watching him as he worked. How Charlus would react, he didn't know. The last thing he wanted to do was to get into a confrontation or to jeopardize any chance he had at ever cultivating a relationship with him in the future.

Yet he knew what his decision would be before he ever made it. Harry couldn't pull his head away. It was like it was stuck between the door and the wall. Harry really did feel as though pulling away was impossible. He wondered if this was what an animal felt like when trapped. Heart racing, panic building, anticipation mounting, and all with the wonder of what would happen when someone stumbled across them.

Harry did not allow himself to be stumbled across. With a single breath and a thousand wary thoughts, Harry pushed the door further ajar and stepped inside the classroom, allowing any remnants of his charm to fade as he stared at the man who was destined to be his grandfather.

Charlus's eyes widened almost at once. Harry was sure that had been what he'd looked like the first time he had spotted the Potter heir. The likenesses were jarring, especially when someone like Charlus would never have expected them.

"Who in the hell are you?" Charlus asked after a very long pause.

"Hadrian Pavonis," said Harry, "but either use my surname or call me Harry."

Charlus's eyes narrowed for a moment and Harry wondered whether he had made some kind of mistake or said something wrong. There had been something searching in the boy's eyes for that moment, but it was gone as fast as it had come.

"Pavonis," Charlus mused. "You're the one who hangs around with Black, right?"

Harry nodded. "Dorea, yeah. She's one of my best friends. Her and Elena Fawley."

"Right. I've seen you around, just... Merlin, that's weird."

Harry couldn't help but allow his lips to curve upwards. "It is a bit, isn't it?"

"You'd think you were a bloody Potter."

"Afraid not," said Harry, hoping no remnants of the pained gong ringing in his chest showed upon his face. "My parents were poor magicians who spent most of my life in America."

There it was again. That same look in Charlus's eyes. It vanished with his shrug, but Harry noticed that the muscles of his face never relaxed. "I suppose there are plenty of people in the world. Some of us have to look alike, I guess."

"I guess so."

"So... as dashing as we both are, that doesn't exactly explain why you were trying to eavesdrop on me."

Harry blushed. "I... don't really have a good explanation."

"Well, let's hear the subpar one you've come up with, then."

"I just got curious. I spend a lot of time duelling in abandoned classrooms and wondered what the hell all the noise was. I was just out wandering the castle since not all that many people are here."

"Damn you!" Charlus cursed, watching his face. "Why is it that your subpar explanation has to be so relatable?"

Harry tilted his head. "Is that how you ended up here?"

Charlus's expression darkened. "Something like that, yeah. I had the idea before and for a lot of reasons, but that was one of the things that actually got me to do it. Not the noise bit, just wandering around."

"So we have more in common than just how we look, then?" Harry wasn't sure what gave him the boldness to speak in this way, but the words seemed to leap from his mouth. There was something about Charlus. Already, Harry had the impression he was just an easy person to talk to.

"Put it this way, if I was wandering through the halls and heard someone blowing things up, I'd have rushed off too." He smirked. "Though I'd like to think I wouldn't have reached out and touched a doorknob linked to a sensory ward."

Harry blushed --- sensing more subtle wards was apparently still very much beyond him. "I'll try not to make a habit of it."

"Preferably don't make a habit of rushing off after sounds and eavesdropping in general. Aren't you supposed to be a Slytherin?"

Harry's face flushed again. The rivalry between Gryffindor and Slytherin didn't seem to be as intense as it had been in his own time. Much of that probably had to do with the fact Voldemort had not yet risen to power and reigned terror upon the lands with Parseltongue and Slytherin values.

That wasn't to say there was no rivalry at all. It was still there, simmering just beneath the surface, it just had not quite boiled over as of yet. There were few violent disputes in the halls. It rarely escalated that far in these times, but there were plenty of pointed barbs exchanged in corridors all around the castle each and every day.

"Is it a problem if I am?" Harry challenged. It meant to sound light and mocking, but it didn't quite come out that way. His voice had been too thin and too rough.

Charlus shrugged. "That depends. Are you one of the idiots hanging off of Riddle as though she's the second coming of Merlin?"

Any affection Harry held for the boy in front of him swelled with the might of a thousand Engorgement Charms all in a single heartbeat. "No, I actually wish she would leave me alone."

Charlus nodded slowly. "You seem all right in my books, then. You said you duel, right?"

Harry frowned. "Yeah, quite a bit, why?"

"Tell you what. Let's have a round or two of duelling. Depending how you do, you might be even more than all right. I haven't quite decided yet."

Harry's lips curved up into a smirk. There was a glowing warmth inside his chest and it was spreading throughout his body. He wasn't sure if it was the thrill of a new duelling challenger or the rush of meeting his grandfather for the first time, but Harry wasn't sure he had ever been as happy as the moment he took his stance across from Charlus.

***December 25, 1942***

***The Great Hall***

***6:00 PM***

Little about the winter feast had changed in the fifty years between Harry's time and this one. The hall was still decorated with towering trees, plentiful wreathes of garland, never-melting icicles, and all the other trinkets that came with this magical time of the year at Hogwarts.

Harry noticed all of this the second he strolled into the Great Hall alongside Charlus.

"This never won't be weird," Charlus muttered the second the duo stepped across the hall's threshold.

Harry shot him an inquisitive look. "Have you never gotten used to it?"

"I didn't stay behind for my first few years at school," Charlus explained quietly. "The war's changed that lately."

"Ah," was all Harry could say as the two of them neared the long, single table set out for those who stayed behind.

There were more students present than there ever had been in Harry's time, but there were more students at the castle in general. They still all managed to fit at one magically expanded table, though it was tight.

Charlus took a seat near Dumbledore and Harry noticed that left only two open for him. One of them was beside Emily Riddle and Harry almost winced, casting his eyes towards the other seat. His eyes nearly popped out of his head when he realized it was beside the nutcase, Professor Reginald Edward Gress. The man had fixed Harry's eyesight if nothing else and he couldn't be worse than Riddle.

Yet... would it be impolite to snub Riddle? Usually, Harry would never have cared. House dynamics could get bollocked in matters involving Riddle, but this case was slightly different. This morning had been quite the surprise and Harry now found himself more torn than ever before as to what to do in matters involving the girl who might one day become Lady Voldemort.

***That morning...***

Harry had been surprised during his first year when he had awoken to find a small pile of presents at the foot of his bed. There had been nothing more jarring --- no feeling he'd ever had could compare to what he'd felt then. After ten long years of receiving naught on Privet Drive, it had served as a burning symbol representing all that had changed and it had meant more to Harry than he had ever been able to explain to any of his gift-givers.

This year had similarities, yet it was different. Harry had expected gifts from Elena and Dorea, but no one else. Charlus, perhaps, but there had scarcely been time to pull off gifts considering they had become friendly only days earlier.

Yet there was a small pile at the foot of his bed just like there had been in his first year. It was arguably a larger pile and Harry could not for the life of him figure out why.

Elena and Dorea had sent him gifts like he had suspected, as had Elena's family. Harry supposed that one made sense and that perhaps, he should have expected it. He certainly had not expected the wand holster that Arcturus Black had sent him, nor the book on clearly dark curses from Romulus Lestrange, of all people.

That one started a trend that Harry caught on too quickly. It was one that really ought to have pleased him, but all it did was sent jarring shivers running swiftly up his spine.

Every member of Riddle's circle had sent him some kind of gift. Even Mulciber and Dolohov, though they had each only sent him sweets. Sweets that Harry had no interest in trying; he would not have been at all surprised had Dolohov poisoned them after their passionate duel in Merrythought's class several weeks earlier.

Yet none of those gifts had been the one that surprised Harry the most --- nor had Slughorn's; a heaping box of sweets and a stunning set of dress robes.

The gift that took Harry most aback was from Riddle herself.

Why was it the girl who suspected him of taking the thing she wanted most had sent him a present? It made absolutely no sense. Nothing Riddle ever did seemed to make any sense and it was infuriating.

Yet this had to be the most perplexing thing she had ever done. Harry would have expected it had it been something cursed or poisoned, but it was very clearly neither.

When Harry opened the package, he found only a black notebook. For a second, he had thought it was the diary from second year, but a closer examination revealed that was not the case. Just a plain black notebook with a blank cover and, according to all of Harry's checks, no hexes or curses of any kind.

The book had come with no note, so very slowly, Harry pushed it open and saw that the first page was covered in pristine handwriting Harry could only describe as perfect. Small enough to fit many words on a page, yet not too small to read easily. He had actually grimaced for a second. Of course her handwriting was perfect; what the hell wasn't so maddeningly perfect about Emily Riddle?

Shaking his head and forcing those thoughts from his mind, Harry looked at the text itself and his eyes almost leapt from his skull.

*Occlumency is the word used to describe the magical method used by witches and wizards to augment their mind. There are two forms of Occlumency --- passive and active. Passive Occlumency is magic used to alter one's own mind, usually for the purpose of optimization. Active Occlumency is the term used to describe magic wielded in the effort to defend one's mind from any form of psychic attack. It is the more common and more well-known form of Occlumency and the one I will focus on first, for it and its fundamental techniques are the foundation upon which Passive Occlumency in all of its forms are built upon...*

It went on and on.

Harry began gingerly flipping through page after page and still the notes stretched on. All of it seemed to be about Occlumency --- Riddle's own notes on Occlumency.

What the hell was she playing at?

***Back in the present...***

It still made absolutely no sense.

Why the hell had Riddle given him her notes on Occlumency? Especially after she had tried and failed to breach his mind during the most recent Slug Club meeting.

No matter what her intentions had been, it complicated things.

Harry hated it, but he now felt as though he owed her something in return. It was foolish, he knew. This woman might well become the monster that would one day murder his parents. He was sure she had planned to open the Chamber of Secrets before he had beaten her to it, and Merlin only knew what other dastardly deeds the potential dark lady could be plotting.

Yet... ugh! It was all just the most frustrating feeling in the world and as strongly as Harry felt that snubbing Riddle now was wrong, he wanted even more strongly to just be well away from the whole thing.

That was how he found himself seated beside Professor Reginald Edward Gress, a decision Harry would come to regret the second the infamous alchemist rested his eyes upon Harry.

They shone with a manic glee that made Harry think of the man back in his awful lab coat over the summer. Harry had thought him the oddest sight in the world then, but it somehow seemed even stranger now with the man making plain wizarding robes look entirely unfit to be anywhere near him.

"Ah! Hadrian!" Professor Gress grimaced. "Hadrian... that will never not be an awful name."

"Call me Harry, sir, that's what everyone else does."

"Harry? That's hardly any better! My goodness, boy, now you want to be named after an adjective? My word, I've fixed your sense of sight, maybe I ought to work on fixing your sense of taste next."

Harry just sat back in his chair and sighed. If Riddle had not been staring at him so intensely that he felt pinned to the back of his chair, he might seriously have considered whether or not he had made the wrong decision in choosing to sit with such a complete and utter lunatic.

**Author's Endnote:**

**Chapter 17: Sudden Confrontations Part I**

***December 25, 1942***

***Black Manor***

***6:47 PM***

It did not take long for Dorea to find herself bored by the night's affairs. There were many perks of being a daughter born to the Founding House of Black: money, influence, power, and respect, among other things. But one facet Dorea had never enjoyed was gatherings like tonight's.

Yule was supposed to be a celebration and a day that all enjoyed, but Dorea had never much cared for her family's practices on the night. A simple family dinner was more a political display than a proper gathering, and it never failed to exhaust her. Least of all with her uncle Cygnus constantly probing her about marital futures until her own father stepped in. Lord Sirius Black II was the only one Cygnus ever listened to. Both men were stubborn, and at times belligerent, but even Cygnus knew not to cross the lord of his house.

This dinner was even worse than most others. Its purpose was less about gathering the family and more about announcing Pollux's new-found betrothal to Irma Crabbe. Dorea had nothing against the girl, but she thought her unworthy of such an honour. There was nothing special about her except the fact her family was old. Pollux might not have been the heir, but if something ever happened to Arcturus, he would be the one taking his place. Their father had considered denying the proposal and finding Pollux a more beneficial match, but he had decided against it; Cygnus was quite fond of the idea and Sirius tried not to rouse his brother's anger when doing so was not strictly necessary.

Irma herself looked starstruck and Dorea almost felt bad for her. She'd had nothing to do with the girl during her three and a half years at Hogwarts, but Dorea could tell she was out of her depth. There was a vast difference between growing up a Crabbe and dining with the Blacks. Crabbe's parents were present as well, but they said very little.

She felt a stare on her and glanced in its direction. The one benefit of the night's oddities was that Sirius had yet to press her about her own future. She supposed the break had stretched on too long and expected to see him looking at her, but instead she met the eyes of her brother, Arcturus.

The two of them had scarcely spoken during the months since their return to Hogwarts. More so in the beginning, but less since Dorea had developed true friendships of her own. It had become more difficult to slip off and there had been nothing all that pressing to discuss.

Or so she had thought.

The look he was giving her now indicated something very different. Arcturus had a way of looking older than he really was. Sometimes, Dorea could swear he was twenty-five instead of seventeen. Those eyes looked as though they had seen great battles and mass destruction, like they had looked upon horrors the rest of them could hardly imagine. His face seemed too hard at times, set in a firm line of calculating coldness. The expression still made Dorea shiver on occasion, despite having seen it for years. It was rarely directed her way and she could not imagine what she had done to make him look at her like that.

"Father," she asked next time there was a lull in the conversation, "may I be excused to relieve myself?" The man had roast ham in his mouth, but he nodded curtly and Dorea pushed her chair back and stood, leaving the room with footsteps that were surer than she felt.

Arcturus's look had been the final straw. She had already wanted out of that room, but the pressure had grown immense under his stare and she had suddenly needed an escape. She loved her brother, but that table was not the place to make her feel so anxious. Least of all with the entire family there and watching.

"I didn't mean to startle you."

Dorea fought the urge to jump despite the voice's words. "Merlin, Arcturus!" she cursed. Her brother had an annoying affinity for sneaking up on people. Dorea envied his ability to move so soundlessly. None would call her ungrateful, but the Black heir moved with a special breed of smoothness and subtlety. "Don't do that!"

Arcturus smiled. "Do what?"

"Sneak up on me like that! I swear, you don't make a sound."

"I think I'll keep doing that part if you don't mind. I have a feeling it will be useful one day."

Dorea swatted at him. "Prat." She bit her lip. "Why did you follow me?"

Arcturus shrugged. "You looked stressed."

"And looking at me like that was going to help?"

He frowned. "Looking at you, how?"

She sighed. "Don't worry about it. You just get this look sometimes."

"I suppose it doesn't really matter. Are you alright, Dorea?"

"I'm fine. I just... I'm not fond of these gatherings."

Arcturus sneered. "I can't say I'm fond of watching Pollux clumsily flirt with Crabbe, either."

Dorea smiled. "You know that's not what I mean."

"I do," he admitted. "I also know that's not the only reason you're so stressed."

Arcturus's perceptiveness was both Dorea's most and least favourite thing about her brother. It was useful when he deduced truths she wanted known but dared not say aloud, but in times like these, it was more vexing than anything. Sometimes, Dorea wanted things to stay secret or, at the very least, private. Having Arcturus around made that exceptionally difficult.

"It's nothing to do with you."

He raised a single eyebrow. "You're my sister. Anything to do with you has something to do with me."

"Poor wording," she said with a sly smile. "I imagine there are some things you'd want nothing to do with."

"Probably. Luckily for me, just because they have something to do with me doesn't mean I need to get involved in all of them."

"Then how do you know you need to get involved with this one?"

"What was it you said, sister? Something about how I had a look about me at times that gave my thoughts away?" Dorea glared at him as his lips curved upwards into a knowing smirk. "You're not exactly the hardest in the family to read."

Dorea screwed up her face. "Well, Cassie emotes about as much as a wall, so I would hope not. I sometimes wonder if she has any fun at all."

Arcturus's eyes darkened so fast that Dorea wondered if she had said something wrong. "She has plenty," her brother said. "Most of it just involves Riddle."

That single name seemed to chill the hall they stood in. It was far enough away from the main dining hall that they heard nothing of the family's meal. It was a long dark corridor with a few torches, just barely enough so that one was not blind. Most of the walls were covered in other accessories --- spikes with the heads of dead house elves impaled upon them. Some were long dead, yet others were ones Dorea had known as a child. They had upset her once when she was but a girl. Now, her eyes swept over them like they weren't there at all.

"She scares you," Arcturus observed.

"She does not!" Dorea countered.

"Then she unnerves you."

"She unnerves everyone, Arcturus. No one should be able to do magic like her in their fifth year. She could beat most of the professors."

"All of them," her brother corrected. "Well, all but Dumbledore. Gress is a special sort of maniac, too. I wouldn't put it past him to outthink her, but he wouldn't win an open confrontation."

"See? Of course she unnerves me."

"I see no reason why she should unnerve you. Dumbledore is the most powerful wizard in the country and I don't see you go pale as a ghost any time he passes by."

"Dumbledore isn't... Riddle."

"What does that mean? Are you worried she'll hurt you? You're a Black; she wouldn't dare turn so much of the house against her."

"Would they even turn? She's got most of them so wrapped around her finger, I'm not even sure they'd react."

"They would if enough of the older students pressured them. Not everyone, but many." His stare intensified. "Now, the truth. What is it about her that has you so on edge?"

"It's... not me I'm worried about."

"Ah, Pavonis."

"What did you do that night at Slughorn's?" she asked, suddenly fierce. "When you dragged him off with you."

"I didn't drag him anywhere. I just asked to talk."

"And did what?"

"Talked," he said simply. "There were some things I needed to ask him. Besides, he wanted out of that room worse than you want out of this dinner. Him and Fawley were caught at a table with Riddle and she had already failed to legilimize him."

"She did *what*?"

"I suppose I can't be sure, but I know I'm right. She met eyes with him and then winced. It was a noticeable reaction. Pavonis must have fought her off." Arcturus watched her closely. "Were you aware that he was an occlumens?"

"No."

"How much do you really know about him?"

Dorea opened her mouth, but closed it. She had never thought of things from that angle before. What did she know about Harry?

"I know him as a person," she said carefully.

"But not about him," Arcturus finished. "You have no idea where he came from---"

"His parents died in a raid---"

"I know what the official story is."

Dorea's eyes widened. "And you don't believe him?"

"I'm sure there's some truth in it. His parents dying in a raid adds up surprisingly well."

"So does Ilvermorny. He's needed help in Runes and Arithmancy all year."

"Plenty of people have trouble with those classes, but yes, that's a point in his story's favour."

"What don't you believe then?" Dorea asked with her hands on her hips.

Arcturus studied her for a moment before he spoke. "Do you honestly believe that a son of no-name travellers would be an occlumens talented enough to fend off Riddle at the age of fourteen?" Dorea felt as though someone had smacked her, but her brother went on. "Do you believe he would be casting a Patronus Charm and that he would be so talented in Defence that he was moved ahead a grade; something not even Riddle earned the right to do?"

"What's your point?" Dorea asked, flushed and feeling a great heat rising in her chest.

Her stomach twisted at the mention of this. Logically, she could deny none of it and understood that he was right, but every word against Harry felt like something was stabbing at her twisted innards.

"My point is to be careful," her brother warned. "I've spoken to him and I think he means well, but intentions aren't always what matter in the end. I'm saying that he isn't who he says he is and I'm warning you not to get dragged into anything you're not aware of and prepared for." He smiled. "Being caught flat-footed would be most unbefitting for a daughter of House Black."

***December 31, 1942***

***Horace Slughorn's Office***

***1:26 PM***

"How have your holidays treated you?" Slughorn asked through a mouth full of tender lamb.

That was a complicated question. Harry had enjoyed much of his break, yet the cloud of worry still hung dark and imposing above his head.

Meeting Charlus had been one of the best things to ever happen to him. Harry hadn't realized how badly he'd needed a male friend again, but Merlin it was nice. Not that there was anything wrong with either Dorea or Elena, but Charlus offered something very different that Harry badly needed. Having a new and talented duelling partner was also nice, in its own way.

Yet the tension with Riddle had only thickened since the arrival of her present on Yule. The book was not what troubled him, though he did plan to figure it out one way or the other. What troubled him was the girl herself. She had not pressed him over the holidays like he had expected. Harry had spent much time in the chamber, but he was beginning to realize it was unnecessary. Riddle had even backed off some since her friends departed. Perhaps she was buried in her own pursuits, but Harry was not about to discount the prospect of her acting with nothing but deliberation. She might think it would lower his guard. Sadly for her, she was mistaken.

Or... was she?

Harry's face twisted into something foul even as he considered Slughorn's question.

Harry had received a letter the day before from Slughorn asking him to lunch that day. Harry had expected the letter for some time. The few Slug Club members that remained at Hogwarts were all getting them, each dining privately with Slughorn so he could focus entirely upon them. It was a wise move on his part, especially in Harry's case. He would have tried to find some kind of excuse to get out of the meeting had Riddle been invited to the same lunch as him.

Harry had been on edge before the last Slug Club gathering, but her Legilimency probe and its implications worried him. What was worse was the distance she had kept since the holidays began. Two weeks ago, Harry would have said he wanted nothing more than a break, but the respite was ominous and screamed of slowly hatching schemes. It made Harry's skin crawl and worried him more than any display of magic or power she could have shown him.

Yet there had been that damned gift. Something that was so useful on the surface, but something that surely had to be a trap of some kind. If Harry could prove it, he could perhaps move against Riddle and force her out of Hogwarts.

Slughorn was frowning when Harry refocused on the conversation. There was a moment of silence before Harry realized he must have missed something whilst he'd sunk into his own contemplations.

"Sorry, sir, I didn't catch that."

"I asked if you were all right, m'boy. You seem troubled and that look... you're sure you are well?"

"I'm all right, sir. Just a bit under the weather is all."

"I see. Holidays not treating you as well as one might hope?"

"I've enjoyed the holidays. I've met some new people and enjoyed the break. Presents are never a bad thing, either."

Slughorn chuckled. "No, they aren't. I must thank you for the crystallized pineapple. It is my favourite as I'm sure you well know."

Harry wondered just how much crystallized pineapple the man could eat. Harry hoped for his sake the answer was plenty. The fact it was his favourite was common knowledge amongst Slug Club members. Slughorn had let that slip on a number of occasions and Harry was sure most of them had elected to buy the professor the same gift. Though, in this case, he ought to thank Elena's parents, for it was them who had begun giving Harry a steady allowance last summer.

"It's no trouble, sir. It's the least I could do after everything you've helped me with."

Slughorn waved a hand, all troubles from a moment ago seemingly forgotten. "Nonsense, m'boy, absolute nonsense. It's all been a pleasure. You've been a joy to have at Hogwarts. Professor Merrythought raves about you in the staff room and even Albus is impressed."

"I like Professor Dumbledore. He offered to give me extra instruction once the new term starts."

"Did he?" asked Slughorn, eyes gleaming. "You plan to take him up on it, I hope?"

"I do."

Dorea's words came back to him as he thought about Dumbledore's offer and the prospect of expediting his progress in Transfiguration.

*"A man like Albus Dumbledore would never settle for equal. I think he wants to train you to be her better."*

The prospect made his skin tingle with anticipation. Whether Dumbledore really could elevate Harry so far, he had no idea. Yet improvement was improvement when all was said and done. Extra learning with Dumbledore was the thing Harry most eagerly awaited. The old man had been next to a god in his own time, and the thought of working closer with him boosted Harry's confidence all on its own.

Cerastes, Dumbledore, Dorea, Elena, Charlus --- all of them together would continue to elevate Harry. And perhaps Riddle too, though he doubted it was her intention. Once he discovered whatever trap the book contained and drove her from the castle, Harry had every intention of sucking the book dry of every bit of information it had to offer on Occlumency. If he were to do that, he had by now decided there was only one way.

"Good," said Slughorn. "Any sort of tutoring Albus offers you would be more valuable than any gift I could ever give."

Harry fidgeted in his chair as though nervous. It was hardly difficult --- asking things of adults was still nerve wracking for him after years spent in the Dursleys' care on Privet Drive.

"Sir, I... wondered if I could ask you something."

Slughorn beamed at him; by now, Harry knew nothing gave the man greater pleasure than feeling needed. "Ask away, dear boy, ask away."

"Well... I wanted to look more into Defence Against the Dark Arts. If Professor Dumbledore is going to help me get ahead in Transfiguration, I want to make sure I keep up in Defence."

Slughorn frowned. "I don't imagine even I could convince Professor Merrythought to extend that courtesy. She is most fond of you, but---"

"That's all right, Professor. I understand."

"My apologies, Harry."

"That actually wasn't what I was going to ask."

"Oh." Slughorn looked puzzled as he fiddled with his walrus moustache. "So sorry then, Harry. Ask away, one more time."

"I was wondering... I don't think it's a normal thing. I'm not even sure you're allowed..."

Slughorn winked at him. "Some rules can be stretched in the right circumstances," he said with a suggestive smile.

Harry took a deep breath. "I was wondering if I could have a pass to the Restricted Section."

It would have been so easy back in his time. Harry had snuck into the forbidden section of the library under the guise of his invisibility cloak back in first year. He had gotten away with it even after rousing that horrible screaming book. Had he still been in possession of his cloak, none of this would have been necessary.

Slughorn continued to twirl his moustache. "A pass... hm."

"It's all right if not," Harry hastened to say, but a contemplative look had come over Slughorn's face.

"You are quite the exceptional student and wouldn't be the first seeking extra credit. Yes, that would appease the old man." Slughorn waved his wand and summoned a sheet of parchment. Harry could hardly believe his eyes as he watched him scribble upon its surface.

***January 2, 1943***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***9:58 PM***

The new year broke with little drama. Riddle continued to keep her distance and the snow outside continued to fall in great pale flakes that stuck in Harry's hair any time he dared to step outside. Many of the flurries broke against the castle's ancient stone walls, but much more of the snow had begun piling up on the ground far below. There had to be twice as much of it as there had been when most of the students had departed.

None of its effects were felt inside the castle, where yet another thing remained unchanged.

Harry and Charlus still met often to practice duelling and general magic. If anything had changed, it was that the frequency of their meetings had increased the closer the two of them had grown.

It was strange how fast they had come together, but it just felt natural. More so even than speaking with Dorea or Elena. It was like Harry had Ron back sometimes, though Charlus was a far cry from his old redheaded friend. He was older and a great deal more studious. He was also harder somehow, as though the war or something else had made him grow up much faster than Ron. Harry supposed that if something about it had stopped him from returning home then that made a degree of sense.

The two of them had practiced strictly duelling until their last session, during which Charlus had decided things needed to change.

***The previous day...***

Harry let out a frustrated grunt as Charlus tossed him back the wand that had been torn from his hands.

Losing to Charlus had been no surprise. The Potter heir was two years older than Harry and extremely talented in his own right. He was a feared duellist even amongst the older Slytherins and some whispered that he was the only boy in the castle whom Riddle did not dare cross.

What had been less expected were the results as of late. Charlus had beaten Harry as expected, but their duels had been competitive. *Had* being the operative word. The gap between them seemed to expand instead of close the more they sparred, and Harry was beginning to grow frustrated.

"You're too predictable," Charlus told him, snapping Harry from his irritation and forcing him to look up.

"What do you mean?" he snapped back. "I'm using all sorts of different spells."

"Curses, jinxes, hexes." Harry frowned at Charlus, unsure of what he was saying. "It's not hard to defend any of those when you know they're coming. You just need to realize what it is that's being used against you."

"That's not being predictable," Harry argued, "you just know more spells than me."

Charlus raised an eyebrow. "How did you lose the last duel?"

Harry actually had to think about that; it had all been over in an adrenaline-induced blur. "You created a wall that blocked my spells. I tried to blast it apart, but the break gave you long enough to fire back at me while my guard was down."

"In other words, Transfiguration. Conjuration if you want to get particular."

"Are you saying I need to conjure things if I want to beat you?"

"It would help, but not necessarily. If you fancy learning how to enchant things, that works too, but I wish you the best of luck with that; very few ever manage it. You can also use things like elemental magic. Just not the same thing. Curses, curses, curses. They're just flashing lights. They get easier to defend once you've seen them enough times. They'll never work against anyone elite on their own."

Harry scowled. "I'm not a sixth year."

"So?"

"So, I don't know how to do any of that."

Charlus just smirked. "No time like the present to fix that, I say."

***Back in the present...***

That had been what tonight's meeting had consisted of. Conjurations were much more difficult than anything else Harry had ever done with Transfiguration, but he had managed to make a flock of birds appear from nowhere. Charlus said Harry had managed it faster than him --- and the Potter heir was allegedly the best in his year at the subject.

He had just left whilst Harry waited. Neither of them particularly wanted to be seen in the hall together given the rivalry between their two houses. It wasn't quite as bad as it would be fifty years from now if nothing changed, but Harry dreaded the consequences of some Gryffindor seeing the two of them walk together. Especially after he had gone to Slughorn's party with Cassiopeia Black.

Charlus's absence suddenly made the task of matching Riddle feel enormous. In his mind, it dwarfed Cerastes, the castle, and anything else Harry had ever known.

Even more so when he heard the door open behind him and turned to face the girl herself.

Harry's mouth fell open. Both he and Charlus had placed every ward they knew upon the room. There was no way she could have just strolled in so casually, was there?

"Good evening, Harry," she said with no hint of a smile. That was how he knew he was in trouble. "I've been quite kind in giving you the space you want, but I think it's time we finally talk. I've grown tired of being ignored."

**Chapter 18: Sudden Confrontations Part II**

***January 2, 1943***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***9:59 PM***

The blood in Harry's veins froze at the sound of her voice. There could be no mistaking who had entered the room. That voice had permeated enough of his nightmares for him to recognize it on instinct. Soft and quiet, smoother than silk but sharper than any sword. An involuntary shudder ran up his body as every muscle inside of him seemed to twitch in single-minded unison.

She was all that stood between him and the door, but she might as well have been a mountain for how effectively she blocked his exit. Harry had almost grown used to Riddle's unnatural height, but the way he had to look up to meet her eyes struck him now. It made her seem all of a sudden more imposing. An obstacle that was impenetrable. It was like she knew what he was thinking too. The way her lips curved upwards as she looked down at him; Merlin, he hated that she could look down on him.

Then he realized she may well know what he was thinking. Harry averted his eyes and began to think, but no way out sprung to mind. There was, of course, the chance this was something innocent, but Harry was not naïve enough to believe that was true. If any part of him might have suspected it, her greeting had stopped those thoughts dead in their tracks.

*"I've been quite kind in giving you the space you want, but I think it's time we finally talk. I've grown tired of being ignored."*

The worst part of this whole thing was that Harry felt unsure what upset him more --- the fact he'd found himself in this position, or the fact he hadn't seen it coming.

Part of him had known this altercation would come, yet he had been caught unaware. No part of him could justify it nor tell himself he could not have known. Some might have taken her pleasant distance over the holidays as a blessing, but Harry had known it heralded some kind of curse.

Of course it would be tonight. The other students would return that next evening. It would normally have been several hours earlier, but the Hogwarts Board of Governors had decided to run the train on Monday instead of Sunday. It was a last-minute change of plans to divert any possibility Grindelwald might have of striking. Harry thought the precautions were needless despite the attack on Diagon Alley, but he had foresight on his side. Everyone from his own time said that Grindelwald had steered mostly clear of Britain; Harry did not expect to see him inside the country's borders again.

In hindsight, this had been obvious. Striking tonight meant that the fewest people possible would be present in the castle. Riddle must have thought it would make following Harry and trapping him alone easier, and that it would minimize her risk.

She had been right.

Harry had considered none of that. His mind had been on duelling and improving. The concept of Riddle and what it would take to beat her had occupied so many of his thoughts that he stopped considering the real thing entirely; now he was going to pay for it.

"You look troubled," Riddle observed.

"I don't like being snuck up on."

Being confrontational would get him nowhere. Three years of dealing with Snape would have taught Harry that much even if he had not learned the lesson long ago on Privet Drive.

This was much like those experiences, whether they were in the past or the future. Riddle had all the power here, and Harry knew it. She had surprised him and obviously had a plan; which was much more than he could say. He could draw his wand, but to what end? If he did, he would only end up battered as well as defeated. Harry was set on beating her one day, but that time had not yet come and it would not arrive soon. Harry was not delusional enough to convince himself otherwise.

Which left him very few options. The only feasible one he could see at the moment was damage control; despite every inch of him aching to run or to fight, logic be damned.

"That's a funny coincidence," said Riddle. "Personally, I dislike being ignored. Perhaps we can come to an accord."

An accord? She wanted to negotiate with him? That seemed remarkably out of character based on everything Harry knew regarding the Riddle of his time. Lord Voldemort did not negotiate --- he took what he wanted and asked no questions.

Though perhaps that was what Riddle meant to do. She might well have thought offering Harry some delusion of a choice might convince him to lower his guard. Or perhaps she just wanted to see how he reacted. If she hoped to lower his guard further, she had squandered that possibility as soon as she had ambushed him. If she wanted to see how he reacted... he supposed there was little he could do about that, particularly because Harry himself still had no idea how to act.

"What do you want?" he asked Riddle, eyeing her long, pale fingers. Harry had seen a wand appear between them seemingly from out of nowhere in the past. If they so much as twitched, he would go for his own wand. Futile or not, he would fall in battle like his father if that was what this came to.

Riddle just raised an eyebrow. The nonchalance about that simple gesture made Harry's blood boil. How dare she treat this so casually? It was like he posed her no threat at all --- like nothing he would ever do could ever hope to trouble her in the slightest. Her arrogance was maddening --- most of all because Harry found convincing himself she was wrong to be difficult.

"Have I not made that obvious? I thought I said my answer clearly enough."

"You just said that you don't like being ignored."

"And I don't. I have a great distaste for it. I've spent most of my life being ignored for my successes and hounded for my failures. It feels as though you've been doing that all year." She fixed him with that unnerving stare of hers. "It's curious, really. Most boys in this castle fall all over themselves at the sight of me, yet you pull away and seem to hold something against me." She took a step forward and Harry moved back, only to find himself pressed against the cold glass of a window overlooking the edge of a cliff and the Black Lake far below. "The matrons at the orphanage had a reason. A pathetic, misguided reason, but a reason. I'm curious, Pavonis --- what is your reason for disliking me so much? I can never remember being anything but pleasant towards you."

"I don't---"

"Liar." Harry's posture stiffened. "Right now, I am curious and impatient. Lie to me again and that may change."

A bead of sweat as cold as the winter air outside tumbled from Harry's forehead and slid slowly down his cheek. His tongue flared nervously out and caught it. The salt of it attacked him, but Harry found the poor taste pleasant. Anything to distract him from the all-consuming blankness of his mind was pleasant.

That was what really made this a nightmare. Riddle had threatened him for the first time ever. Her perfect facade was gone and now, Harry was finally getting a peek underneath at the monster he had once known. Yet there was no fear --- not even anger. His nerves certainly mounted and he would be lying if he said he did not dread whatever she would do to him, but he was not afraid. There was something to be said for having died and come back to life again. Very little could truly scare a man after something as harrowing as that.

There was nothing but a void of numb uncertainty. It all came back to the same problem that had been plaguing Harry all year --- uncertainty.

In his world and his time, Harry had known what Voldemort wanted. Power and vengeance. Stopping him from getting those things was easier said than done, but Harry had at least known from what angle to look at things from.

Here, he was not afforded even that luxury.

This glimpse had made Harry surer still that Riddle was already walking the path that led to her becoming Voldemort, but even now, he could not be sure. Even if he could, her motivations remained unclear. Voldemort had possessed a good reason to fixate upon Harry in his own time, but here? What was it Riddle wanted with him? Why was she so unreasonably interested? Harry might have thought it was because he had repelled her Legilimency attack at Slughorn's party, but the fixation had started long before they had stepped foot in that room.

She did not fear him; that much was clear. She was too dismissive; even now she stood wandless and with her hands held carelessly before her. Yet for the same reason, Harry didn't think she wanted to curse him. She'd had countless opportunities this year. Sure, he might have gone to a professor, but what of it? She could probably cast a Memory Charm by now and even if not, this was a version of the boy who had escaped punishment for premeditated murder. His back had been turned when she had entered the room, anyway. If there was any time to cut him down, that had been it.

So what was it Riddle wanted?

Could it be as she said? Did she just want to understand why he disliked her? Harry doubted it; there had to be more to this curiosity than that. Even if it was only as she said, it did him no good. It was not as though he could answer her question --- he would sooner suffer her wrath than let her in on that secret and grant her an avenue of learning what could very well be the future.

"I wasn't lying," Harry answered carefully. "I don't dislike you. I just don't trust you."

There was at least a grain of truth in it. Harry hated the idea of what she may become more than anything in the world, but Riddle herself had given him no explicit cause to hate her. None but the fact she still dared to look down at him in that way of hers, always managing to look vaguely amused, as though the world was some kind of sick joke that only she understood.

"That much is clear. Had you trusted me, I doubt you would have moved so forcefully back in October."

Harry's heart began to race as he willed himself to look up and meet her eyes as he took a wild gamble. He thought hard about the Chamber of Secrets --- but only in the context of his own time. Harry knew it worked when he saw the momentary flash of doubt in her expression; she had seen nothing despite her efforts.

"It's irrelevant," Riddle decided. "The only thing that matters is that you're wary of me."

"Plenty of people in the house are wary of you."

"Not like you. There is something about you... an air of knowing things you have no right to know."

She was brilliant --- Harry had to give her that. Riddle would never know how close she was to being right, never feel the horrible lurch his stomach gave at her words, never experience the wave of panic that threatened to drown him before he just barely managed to fend it off.

"I don't see how that would explain any of this. You volunteered to tutor me, you set me up with your friend, and now this. None of it makes sense to me. You say I know too much and wonder why I don't trust you? Connect the dots, Riddle. I don't think it's hard to work out why."

Her eyes had not left his face, but Harry wished they would have. "Your actions don't add up, even when applying your own logic."

Harry frowned. "How don't they?"

"If you were wary of my intentions, surely you would try to find out what they were. If you were unnerved by how interested I'd become in you, logic would dictate you find out why."

"Or---"

"Or you suspect things about me that give you pause. Things that make you stay away. It's said that humans fear the unknown, but you think there's something about me that's more concerning than that and you've thought so from the moment you met me."

"So you still think that I'm lying to you?"

Her lips tugged slightly upwards. "No. If I thought you were lying to me, this conversation would look very different. I just think there are things you're not telling me."

Harry scoffed. "Things I'm not telling you? Of course there are things I'm not telling you. Do you expect me to spill every last secret I have to a girl who I met four months ago?"

"No. I just don't make a habit of expecting boys I've never met to treat me as though I had the plague."

"Make your point, Riddle." The time had come for a resolution. Harry knew if this went on, they would talk in circles for hours and hours. It was a game she seemed content to play and it was one she'd likely practiced before.

"My point?"

"Yes, your point. You've found out nothing you didn't know already. What is it you want?"

She actually did smirk this time. Not a trace, but a full smirk that split her face and sent a twisted light leaping through her eyes. "I'm afraid I didn't think of this in terms quite so linear."

Harry's lips thinned. "Linear?"

"Yes, linear. There was more to this than a point and it was never so straightforward."

"You said you wanted to come to an accord," Harry reminded.

"Yes, an accord. An accord that would be based on information I had not yet gathered."

"Well, you've gathered it now. Make your point or leave."

Harry could feel the tension building. His hand itched to snatch his wand, but still he bit down the impulse. It would get him nowhere, and though the room's air was ominous, Harry did not think it heralded the coming of a storm. Something was brewing behind Riddle's eyes, but Harry had not yet gotten the impression it was an attack of any kind.

Riddle's foot tapped swiftly upon the floor as she twirled a lock of hair idly around one of those long fingers of hers. "Yes, I suppose I have gathered a certain amount of information." She considered him for a moment, weighing him under the judgement of her stare. "I would like to offer you a proposal."

Riddle really did want to negotiate with him; he could see the truth staring back at him plain as day. What had his life become since being plunged decades in the past?

"A... proposal?" Harry asked carefully.

"Yes, a proposal. It suddenly strikes me that the tension between us stems from poor communication and a lack of understanding on both sides."

If only it was that simple. Harry yearned for it to be so straightforward. It was ironic that Riddle spoke of linear thoughts in one breath and then simplified something so inherently complex in the next. If it had all been so easy, Harry would have avoided a great deal of mental and emotional strife. If it had all been so easy, perhaps he would not have done what he had this year. If everything had been as she said, perhaps there would be no burning desire to be this girl's better.

Though he suspected there would. No matter what she said or did, Harry had a hard time envisioning a world in which he did not see at least the shadow of Lord Voldemort any time he looked at her. That was always going to breed a desire to be better. Just like how in his own time, Harry had quietly decided it would be him who finished Lord Voldemort once and for all. Back then, he had simply lacked both the courage to admit that to himself and the drive to pursue such lofty goals.

Much had changed since he'd arrived in the past, and not all of it was so bad. There were facets of Harry's new life he enjoyed, but most of all he was becoming something he could be proud of. Had he stayed in the world he'd once known, Harry was unsure how long it would have taken for him to reach a similar realization. Mayhaps that thought would never even have come.

"What does that have to do with your proposal?"

"My proposal is that we resolve these communication issues by communicating more often."

Harry almost snorted out loud. She could play as much chess as she wanted; he wasn't going to give in just because she had made her point colourfully. "And you think I'm going to agree even though you've said I've been ignoring you all year?"

"Agree so easily? No. This is why I said it was a proposition and not a request. You would never accept that request."

That moment was the most Harry had ever doubted everything he knew about Riddle --- the most he ever wondered whether his suspicions were wrong. He would have expected her to make threats or perhaps even brutalize him until he agreed to her terms, but she was doing none of that. It put him on edge. There was still the issue of what would happen when he inevitably declined her proposal.

"And if I refuse?"

"Then you're a fool."

Harry narrowed his eyes. "Or just wary."

"Wariness would not account for turning down immunity from the pack of purebloods who would like nothing better than to curse you into oblivion." She smiled a sharp smile that made Harry shiver and before she spoke her next words, he somehow knew she had him. "Not to mention the magical room that can become anything you like and aid you in any ways you could imagine."

***Several hours later...***

Harry had tried to sleep, but it had been to no avail. Thoughts of his earlier conversation with Riddle had plagued him and driven off all attempts weariness made to ensnare him in its clutches. His doubts, worries, and raging emotions were all daggers driving away fatigue every time it threatened to come too close.

Harry hardly remembered getting up from bed and making his way out of his dorm room, but before he knew it, he was stepping into the dark tunnel leading to Salazar's fabled chamber, listening to his footsteps echo in the dim corridor as he robotically moved one foot in front of the other.

What Cerastes or the Chamber of Secrets could do for him now, Harry didn't know.

**"Open."**

The doors parted and he stepped inside, hissing at the towering statue and turning away as a massive body thudded against the floor.

**"You seem troubled,"** Cerastes observed.

**"Never more."**

**"Is it the usurper again?"**

**"It is."**

The snake spat; Harry could practically feel the hatred rolling off its scales in forceful waves. **"I will never understand why you don't let me kill her."**

Neither would Harry, if truth was to be told. There was just a part of him that hesitated. It would be easy and his life would become a great deal less perilous. At first, Harry had told himself it was wrong. It was something Voldemort would do and stooping to such a level would be defeat, whether he won or not.

Harry thought of that less often now. There were other reasons he had for not unleashing the basilisk, but they lurked just out of his reach and hid in shadow. Their forms remained unclear to him, but Harry could sense their presence. They existed, Harry was just still unaware of exactly what they were.

**"This time's different,"** he hissed as way of an answer.

**"Different how?"** the serpent asked.

**"She offered me a proposal."**

**"A proposal?"**

**"Terms to speak and interact more often. She's noticed that I ignore her and she doesn't understand why."**

Cerastes spat with fury again. **"She lies. You prevented her from usurping your right. She knows this."**

Harry thought back on that conversation and for the first time this year, he wondered whether that might be untrue. There had been doubt in her expression when he had used the last vestiges of his mother's protection to deceive her and her Legilimency. For the first time all year, Harry thought he might have put true doubt in Riddle's mind. It was his proudest moment since diving back into the past.

**"I don't care whether she knows or not,"** Harry lied; he thought he was becoming more adept at lying as of late, but a bitter taste lingered every time he did.

**"Then what is it that troubles you?"**

Harry ran a hand through his hair and felt his shoulder twinge. Every muscle was so tight that even such minuscule movements sent painful jolts coursing through him. Never had he been so tense; not when facing Quirrell for the Philosopher's Stone, not the first time he had been down in this chamber, and not even when slumped atop the Astronomy Tower minutes before his life had been uprooted.

**"The fact that I'm not sure I can turn her down."**

**"Then don't."**

Harry almost looked at Cerastes before his brain caught up and he fought off the urge. That was the last thing he had expected the basilisk to say. He had always been a strong advocate of killing Riddle, but now he was advising Harry to accept terms he had not yet heard?

**"Don't seem so surprised,"** Cerastes hissed with more bite than Harry had expected. **"You are my master's heir, are you not?"**

**"I am,"** Harry hissed with as much false conviction as he could manage. That particular lie was difficult to tell at the best of times.

**"He would not care if she wished to usurp him. He would care only for himself. Does this agreement advance you?"**

**"Yes... well, it should, anyway."**

**"Then why do you hesitate?"**

Another question he could not answer. Not without revealing things that would undermine his entire story. There were few things Harry hated more than when his path was impeded by the truths he could not tell.

**"She's a Legilimens,"** he decided after a long pause. **"There are secrets---"**

**"Secrets that will be kept when you learn to defend your mind."**

Harry frowned. **"And how am I supposed to do that?"**

Cerastes made a sound Harry had never heard before. He thought it might have been laughter, but it was impossible to tell.

**"Trust in me and it shall be done."**

**Chapter 19: A Calculated Risk**

***January 3, 1943***

***The Entrance Hall***

***9:13 PM***

It was almost strange seeing Dorea and Elena stroll back into the castle after what felt like such a long time away. The fact it had scarcely been two weeks seemed surreal to Harry. It was as though the winter break had stretched over months or years for all that had happened. A new bond with lost family that seemed to run almost as deep as his friendships with the two girls moving towards him, a promise of more rapid progression by the secret monster still under Harry's command, and of course, the agreement with Riddle.

That pact had not yet been agreed to, but Cerastes had spoken true. If Harry could protect his mind and his secrets, he had much to gain. The idea that Riddle might be able to discover things about him even without Legilimency was what worried him most, but how could he turn the offer down? A room that could serve any purpose, immunity from some of the most dangerous students in the castle and their schemes, and the potential to grow as a wizard more than he ever could without the agreement?

Accepting the bargain would probably be the thing truest to his old character he had done since arriving back in the past. It was aggressively on-brand for the Gryffindor golden boy, but Harry liked to think there was some Slytherin cunning in the choice. It was about mitigating risk. Harry was not happy with the agreement; he was simply aware that turning it down would be pragmatically foolish.

"Harry!" cried Dorea as she moved forward and threw her arms around his neck. Harry stiffened for a second in surprise. He felt Dorea's arms loosen, but he hesitantly reached up and wrapped his arms around her in return before she could pull away. The Dursleys and their cruelty were half a century away and in a different world on top of that. Allowing them any power over him here would be the rawest form of defeat he had ever suffered.

"Excited, are we?" asked Elena. Harry thought there was something odd about her expression. The way she looked between Dorea and Harry as though she knew something no one else did.

"I'm excited to see just about anyone who doesn't have the surname Black," Dorea said as the three of them began trudging their way through the thickets of students clustered around the hall. They eyed the grey stone stairs leading down to the dungeons some ways up ahead, but a seemingly impenetrable wall of flesh and bone separated it from them.

"Was it that bad?" Elena asked with a frown as the trio slowly began making headway.

"Yes. The entire dinner on the evening of Yule was all about Pollux."

"Seventh year, right?" Harry asked. "Cousin of yours, I think?"

"Sixth year, but yes."

"You don't get along?"

"We don't talk all that much. There's nothing wrong with him and he wasn't even the problem."

"Then what was?"

"The fact that it was all about him and his new betrothed."

"Betrothed?"

The word tasted strange on Harry's tongue. He knew, of course, that a number of the old pureblood families still worked within the confines of betrothal contracts. Slughorn had taught him as much over the summer, but the concept still felt foreign to him. A part of Harry had a difficult time viewing it as anything other than barbaric, but above all else, it was unimaginable. The idea of being betrothed before you were out of school, oftentimes against your will... there were very few things Harry could imagine being more unpleasant.

"It's still common in my family," Dorea explained. "Pollux is second in the line of succession. Besides, if something were to happen to Arcturus..."

"Why Crabbe?" Elena asked. "Surely Pollux could have done better than her."

"That's what I said! I don't know. It never made any sense to me, but Father didn't see fit to block the match."

Harry furrowed his brow. "So it was Pollux's father who made it?"

"Cygnus, yes. He was never quite as sensible as Father."

Harry saw Elena open her mouth to say something or other, but she closed it just as fast. For a moment, he wondered why. Then, he felt the stare upon his back. He knew who it belonged to without needing to turn around.

Her cerulean blue eyes felt like they were dissecting him; tearing his back open and peering inside to see exactly what made his body work the way it did. Riddle kept her word --- she had promised not to press Harry until he had decided on his answer to her proposal --- but a shiver ran up his spine nonetheless.

He could see the way Elena's skin lost some of its lustre. Dorea tensed, but her movements were more subtle. She was a daughter of House Black; Harry doubted she was fazed by a schoolgirl --- not even one as powerful and dangerous as Emily Riddle.

"How did that go?" Elena asked in a hush just as a gap opened leading to the stone staircase.

Harry waited until they began descending its steps before answering. "You make it sound like I spent two weeks locked in a cage with a tiger."

"It's not far off," Elena muttered, but Harry only rolled his eyes.

"Riddle's a schoolgirl---"

"You know that isn't all---"

"Maybe not, but you act like she's Grindelwald or something."

The words almost stuck in Harry's throat. This lie was especially difficult to weave. Dismissing Riddle's danger felt wrong, but what else was he to do? Dealing with her on his own was difficult enough. Dealing with her whilst two paranoid girls hounded him over it would be even more trying. Elena, in particular, had always been wary. Harry was not at all interested in dragging this on any longer than it had to go.

"You never answered the question," she pointed out.

Harry shrugged with deliberate nonchalance. "It went fine. I just avoided her for most of the break. I met up a ton with a new friend of mine, so that part was nice."

"A new friend?" Dorea asked.

"Potter." His own true surname sounded almost alien on his tongue. It had been so long since he'd heard it. Hearing it still made his stomach lurch, but he had long ago stopped thinking of the name as his.

"Potter?" Elena frowned.

"How'd that come about?" asked Dorea.

Harry shrugged. "We sort of just ran into each other and hit it off. We started practicing duelling most nights during the holidays and it just sort of happened."

"You practiced duelling with Charlus Potter? Isn't he supposed to be the best in the school outside of Riddle?"

Harry grimaced. "Yeah, he's good, trust me."

Elena hid a smile behind her hand. "Have you finally found someone you can't beat?"

"Yet."

The three of them laughed as they continued down towards the dungeons, the dark shadow of Emily Riddle forgotten for now.

***January 5, 1943***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***10:46 PM***

Harry lunged forward and shifted in mid-air, contorting his body so that both spells fired off by Charlus missed him by inches. Pain flared up his leg the second he landed. His ankle throbbed; it felt as though everything from his knee down had just been lit on fire. Harry allowed himself to fall but used the momentum to roll, allowing Charlus's next three curses to miss as well.

Harry waved his wand and three of the desks in the room's corner rose into the air and hurtled at the sixth-year's back. Charlus fired three spells at Harry in quick succession before turning to face the desks that were accosting him. It was clever; by forcing Harry on the defensive, Charlus ensured he would be unable to act on his own momentary shift in focus.

A swished wand later and the desks both split into two long, jagged stakes that sailed towards Harry, whose eyes widened. Charlus never played when it came to duelling.

*"There's a war out there,"* he'd said when Harry first looked surprised at how dangerous some of his offensives were. *"There's no point practicing to duel when we might need to fight."*

It was true enough, but it had been a harsh lesson for Harry to learn.

He brought his wand up and sliced the stakes of wood in two before banishing them back towards Charlus who, this time, vanished them with a wave of his wand. Harry fired three spells that forced him to raise a shield before conjuring a flock of birds and sending them racing towards his older adversary. Charlus burnt them to ash with a surge of fire, but Harry could see the change in him. Harry had taken what Charlus had said about varied attacks to heart and the older boy realized it.

An approving nod later and they were back at it again, exchanging spells for several more minutes before Harry finally fell.

"See?" Charlus offered him a hand up and pulled Harry to his feet.

"You were right," Harry admitted, smiling despite himself.

"I'd say! You lasted twice as long as usual and the desks almost got me. It was clever to use them once my back was turned."

"You did well to drive me back on the defensive."

"You should have deflected the spells. If you'd done that, you might have won."

Harry grimaced. There was truth to that, he knew. There were many things he could have done to win, but it mattered not until he started doing them.

"I will," he vowed.

Charlus raised an eyebrow. "Will what? Start using spell deflection?"

"That too, but no --- I meant win."

Charlus smiled slightly. "We'll see."

"I closed the gap that much with one tip. I'm sure I can do it."

"Maybe," Charlus said with a grin, "but I don't plan to make it easy on you."

"You never make anything easy on me. That's what makes this interesting."

Charlus laughed. "Interesting's one word for it."

"What would you call it?"

"Necessary. I plan to head off and help the war effort if it's still going on by the time I graduate."

Harry's stomach gave a sickening jolt at the mention of Grindelwald's war. Sometimes, it was easy to forget that anything was happening outside of Hogwarts. They received regular updates via the *Daily Prophet*, but neither Grindelwald nor his men had laid a foot on British soil since the attack on Diagon Alley back in August. The war seemed half a world away. Harry never felt the same investment he had when thinking about Voldemort's war, though Grindelwald had not murdered his parents, no matter what he told the others.

"Didn't you say that was why you didn't go home over the holidays? Something about the war." Charlus stared out the window for a moment and did not immediately answer. "Sorry," said Harry, blushing, "I didn't mean---"

"No," Charlus cut in, "it's not you. It just... worries me."

"The war?"

"A bit, but probably not the way you think." Harry stared patiently back at him and the older boy sighed. "Grindelwald doesn't seem to want anything to do with Britain. Not yet, anyway."

"Don't they say he's afraid of Dumbledore?"

Harry had heard this retold decades later and some even whispered about it here. It made sense seeing as Dumbledore had eventually been the one to defeat the dark lord, but Harry got the impression Charlus was more knowledgeable about all of this than any other student Harry had ever spoken to.

"Some do, yeah."

"You don't sound sure?"

"I'm sure they say it, I'm just not sure it's true."

Harry frowned. "But he's never attacked Britain personally, has he? The thing in Diagon this August was the first and they say he wasn't there."

"Dumbledore's never gone off after him, either," Charlus said quietly.

"Why would he? If the fighting hasn't touched Britain---"

"He's done things like it before," said Charlus. "He has a seat on the ICW and they've sent him out with others as peacekeepers."

"Have they asked him to go after Grindelwald?"

Charlus shrugged. "I'm not sure, but plenty in the public have."

"So you're worried Grindelwald will eventually make his way to Britain?"

"A bit, I guess, but I'm worried about my father."

"Your father?"

Charlus nodded. "That's why I couldn't go home over the holidays. My father's gone and is fighting in the war. He has been for the better part of three years now --- ever since the German muggles attacked Britain. He reckoned Grindelwald was behind that even if he didn't dare to do it himself."

It struck Harry --- not for the first time --- how little he knew about his family. He'd never known a great-grandfather of his had opposed Grindelwald in what some had called the Blood War.

"I... didn't really know many wizards did that."

Charlus's face darkened. "All kinds. A bunch of your housemates have families who support Grindelwald."

Harry vaguely remembered Dorea mentioning something about Grindelwald and perhaps even her family, but he could not remember what. If the Blacks were open Grindelwald supporters, Harry thought he would have heard about it by now.

"So what... he just went off?"

"With some family allies, yeah. They've joined forces with a bunch of other wizards on the front lines. This war's different from the last. Wizards were barred from fighting in the muggles' last big war, but loads of them did anyway."

"Did your father fight in that one, too?"

Charlus actually laughed. "My father was ready to give up a Wizengamot position to fight in that one. Yeah, he did. He was one of the first, and plenty of people followed him."

"You said you couldn't go home for the holidays. What about..." Harry's voice trailed off. He had gotten halfway through asking his question before the words caught in his throat. It was suddenly much less difficult to imagine how tactless some people had been in his own time. Sometimes, one did not think before speaking and just became lost in the ebbs and flows of a conversation.

"It's fine," Charlus said a bit stiffly. "My mother went over with my father as a healer. She's dead now."

Harry grimaced. "I'm sorry."

Charlus smiled darkly. "You really might be. You lost yours in some kind of raid, didn't you?"

Harry nodded. "One of Grindelwald's random strikes."

Charlus's face twisted into something ugly. "Seems like we've both got scores to settle then," he said, stepping back into his stance and raising his wand like a sword. Harry too slid into position and they began anew.

***January 8, 1943***

***A Secret Passage on the Third Floor***

***12:11 AM***

Harry and Riddle did not meet that evening as usual to work on Ancient Runes. Riddle had been serious about her promise to not press Harry until he'd declined or agreed to her proposal, but they were meeting now.

Harry had pulled Avery aside after Potions and asked him to pass the message along to Riddle that he had his answer. A large part of him had just wanted to pass along the verdict, but he sensed this was something he needed to do in person. To do it via an envoy would be to admit defeat. It would be proclaiming that fear had closed around his heart.

Harry did not fear Emily Riddle and it was important she knew that. Harry was also determined to ensure Riddle held up her end of the agreement as soon as possible. They would be touring that special room tonight if she wanted her proposition accepted. That would not have been possible had Harry used an envoy.

Another of Riddle's followers had come to Harry after lunch and given him a sheet of parchment that simply had a list of directions. They were unnecessary --- Harry knew the secret room Riddle had indicated, hidden behind a massive mirror on the fourth floor. Harry had seen it countless times on the Marauder's Map, but it had been unusable in his time. The twins had said so, at the very least, and Harry had taken them at their word.

The floor-to-ceiling mirror slid aside like the entrance to their common room when Harry touched it with the tip of his wand. He couldn't say what he had been expecting behind it, but it was not what he was confronted with. It was a long but narrow room with a burning fire in its centre and plush armchairs situated in a circle around the only light source in the room. There was a chill in the air despite the fire --- or perhaps that had to do with the girl sitting in one of the two chairs nearest to the blaze.

She was facing Harry, peering at him impassively as she waited for him to take the chair directly across from her. Harry thought she looked serene sitting there with her eyes glittering like an ocean's surface and her skin almost glowing in the dim light of the room. Her hands were folded in her lap, but Harry noticed her wand was out. She was merely toying with it, but it put him on edge nevertheless. Riddle must have sensed this, for the wand disappeared up her sleeve a moment later.

"Avery told me you've come to a decision."

Harry nodded curtly as he stood behind the proffered chair. "I have."

Riddle gestured to the piece of furniture in front of him. "Take a seat, Harry. It would be a shame for us to start a relationship so coldly."

"I haven't given you my answer," Harry reminded her, but he did reluctantly sit nonetheless.

"I beg to differ," Riddle said lightly, a thin smile teasing the corners of her lips.

Harry narrowed his eyes. "What do you mean you beg to differ?"

"You should know this by now, but I'll tell you in good faith if we're to be friends. You can't hide things from me."

"Because you're a legilimens?"

"I am, but that isn't why. Besides, you seemed to have no trouble fending off my probe."

This was the first time Harry realized exactly how talented a liar Riddle was. It was a half-truth at best, but she told it masterfully. During their last meeting, Harry had baited her with inadvertent thoughts and had seen the reaction in her eyes. Riddle at least thought she had breached his mind once, but Harry would never have known it. There were no signs of deception in her voice nor her expression. She could have given a masterclass on deception.

Not for the first time, he wondered what had become of this in his own time. The Tom Riddle Harry had met in the Chamber of Secrets had been like this girl. A touch less composed, but charming and eloquent. Yet everything he had ever heard of Voldemort screamed nothing of the sort. Violent, reactive, and confrontational; a profile that matched well with the one time Harry could remember coming face to face with the monster in his first year whilst scrambling to save the Philosopher\'s Stone.

"What is it then, if not Legilimency?" he asked.

Riddle smiled. "Do you mind if I be a bit arrogant for a moment?" Harry shook his head. "I am much smarter than most people." There was no note of boasting in her voice, nor even a note of pride. It was simply said as a point of fact; the same way Harry's math teachers back at primary school had once introduced new concepts to the class. "I find everyone else terribly simple-minded. I sometimes feel like I'm playing chess and I can guess where the pieces will move before they even decide themselves." Her smile broadened. "Sometimes, I even nudge them in the right direction."

Harry wondered if that was what Riddle meant to do with him. Uproot him from his current place and toy with him, turning his piece over and over again between her fingers before carelessly discarding it once she was bored, like she had seemed to do with almost all of her friends. Of the students Harry most often saw with Riddle, only Cassiopeia was one he thought she might genuinely respect, at least on some level.

"Why are you telling me this?" Harry asked, his voice hardly discernible over the soft crackling of the fire between them.

"Because I don't want you to see how I treat others and think it's how I view you."

Of all the answers Harry could have anticipated, that was one he would never have expected to hear. "Why?"

"You're different. You're not so simple-minded --- not so predictable. You have depth and dimension. I don't want you to see how I treat the others and think it's how I will ever treat you."

Harry supposed that was probably half true. Riddle would doubtlessly treat him differently to the others... until she found out what she wanted to and won her little game.

It was something Harry could not allow to happen.

"Now," Riddle said before Harry could reply, standing from her chair and appearing to rise forever before she stood at her full height. "How about I show you the wonders of the Room of Requirement?"

**Chapter 20: Deceptions and Detractors**

***January 10, 1943***

***The Great Hall***

***8:17 PM***

It had been more than a day since Harry had agreed to Riddle's proposal, yet still it felt like he moved through a dream; slowly and with difficulty, every step laboured, every thought clouded. He'd spent that first day after the agreement locked up in the room Riddle had spoken of --- a room she had promised could be ordered to keep anyone out.

Harry had spent a large part of that day experimenting with the room. Like Riddle had told him, things like food were impossible, which made sense. Harry had been reading ahead in Transfiguration ever since he'd discovered his talent for it. His progression had been rapid ever since Dumbledore's advice and some time ago, he had read about the five principal exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration.

One thing the room could provide him with was books. Harry's working theory was that it somehow pulled them from the library, for nothing else made sense. It would be his new place of study regardless --- the unparalleled access to exactly what he wanted whenever he wanted it was difficult to believe. Harry had feared Riddle had reneged on their agreement, but now he wondered whether she realized exactly how much she had given him. Harry was sure that, with this, he could improve faster than he'd ever imagined.

Yet dread still clung to him when he entered the Great Hall for the first time in more than a day. The sky seemed to share his mood. The clouds were thick and grey as sleet, but there was no lightning, no thunder, no sign of a storm that might break up the monotony and bring with it the promise of relief.

Dorea and Elena walked on either side of him. Harry could feel their eyes watch him every now and then, but he did not return their stares. Both of them knew that something was wrong. They had known since he'd returned to the common room after his discussion with Riddle. Both girls had pressed him, but Harry had given nothing away.

That was about to change because Harry could already feel another's eyes watching him, and had no reasonable pretence to ignore the stare that still sent shivers running up his spine.

She was there waiting for him, sitting in the centre of the Slytherin table, surrounded by her friends or her sycophants. Harry suspected the latter but wasn't entirely sure. Riddle appeared to actually like at least Cassie and she had positioned the girl well with Harry at Slughorn's Samhain gathering. Of course, that could be nothing but a facade and her maneuvering little more than the strategic placement of pawns.

*"I find everyone else terribly simple-minded. I sometimes feel like I'm playing chess and I can guess where the pieces will move before they even decide themselves." Her smile broadened. "Sometimes, I even nudge them in the right direction."*

She had not omitted Cassie from that speech, but Harry supposed she wouldn't have. It would have weakened her point had she mentioned exceptions other than him. With Riddle, one could never tell what was genuine and what was false. Harry thought that as a general rule, assuming the latter was a much safer option, but one that might make interacting with her next to impossible.

The table was in front of him impossibly fast. Had he crossed the Great Hall already? It had been but five strides ago when he had walked through its doors, or had it? Weariness did odd things to one's mind. Harry remembered noticing how short the walk to the chamber felt this year compared to when he visited it in his own time. He had never noticed how long the corridor was whilst he feared for his life, but then, he wished for a more direct route that would take less time and require fewer steps.

Harry almost tripped on the bench, so swiftly it had come upon him. Riddle just smiled and gestured. The boys on either side of Harry shuffled down a spot. A place for Harry had already been set but now, there was one each for Dorea and Elena.

Merlin, he could feel their stares already. He needed not look over his shoulder to know that their eyes were wide. Elena was probably gaping at him. Dorea had better self-control, but she was doubtlessly raging and wondering which of Riddle's traps had ensnared Harry. She probably thought that it had happened over the winter break, and it was hardly as though Harry could tell her she was wrong. Dorea was annoyingly perceptive that way --- Harry just hoped she did nothing foolish in what she viewed as retaliation.

"I didn't see you at all yesterday," Riddle said, greeting Harry like an old friend. "I was growing worried."

Had she thought Harry had broken his promise so soon after making it? He supposed she might have. If Riddle truly did suspect him of being the Heir of Slytherin, she could have wondered whether he had simply chosen to hide away in the Chamber of Secrets. That sounded somewhat tempting, but it would be a fool's choice.

Harry heard movement behind him, then Elena was sitting on his left, stiff as any statue. Dorea was slower to move. She just stood there and watched.

"Are you all right, Dorea?" Riddle asked, her eyes leaving Harry for the first time. "You seem tense."

"I'm fine," she answered, taking a seat to Harry's right without any further comment and adopting what appeared to be a single-minded focus on the food she began piling on her plate.

Riddle smiled at her all the same. "I'm glad to hear it." She turned back towards Harry. "Do you feel quite all right? No illness or anything of the like?"

"I'm fine," said Harry. "I just had homework that I'd left for too long and almost forgotten about."

"A nasty habit," Riddle chided. "You should fit it into a routine. I find that it's more efficient."

Harry shrugged as naturally as he could. "I've always been a bit of a procrastinator when it comes to homework."

"Shame. If you break that habit, you might find you'll have even more time to pursue what interests you without the added stress. A clear mind is much more efficient."

Harry knew already that what she said was true. His classes caused him less stress now than they had ever before. He thought that was a large part of why he was improving so fast in something like Transfiguration. Without the mental stress and anxiety caused by classes like Divination, Harry could focus more freely on the things that mattered.

A storm of flapping wings and rustling feathers disrupted their discussion as the school's owls flew into the room. There was a cluster of them near the centre that all had feathers so grey they blended with the dreary sky above. The array was broken at once when the birds swooped down towards their targets and levied upon them the missives they had carried.

One landed in front of Harry, who blinked at it but reached for its leg nevertheless.

"Expecting mail, Pavonis?" It was not Riddle who spoke, but Felix Rosier --- the fifth-year male prefect who worked closest with her.

Harry opened his mouth to answer, but the words caught in his throat when he saw the tall, looping script he recognized so well from his own time. Words failed him at the sight of it, so he just shook his head before reading his letter with mounting excitement.

*Hadrian,*

*I promised before the break that I would begin tutoring you privately in my subject at its end if you wished. Now that the school year has begun again in earnest, I see no reason to delay any longer. If the time is agreeable, I think we shall begin meeting at 8:30 every Friday evening in my office. My office can be found in a first-floor corridor off to the right of the staircase leading up to another that is wonderfully decorated in the image of your house.*

*Yours truly,*

*Albus Dumbledore*

Harry felt light for the first time in almost two days. This was something he had been eagerly anticipating ever since it had been promised. An opportunity to work with Albus Dumbledore in a subject he was specialized in was one Harry revelled in. Not even Riddle would be able to match his aptitude in Transfiguration, he was sure of that. If he was talented now, Harry could only imagine to what levels he would rise in the subject under Dumbledore's tutelage.

"Who's that from?" And just like that, any feeling of bliss was torn ruthlessly away. Harry contemplated for a moment whether he could avoid answering Cassiopeia, but decided he could not. It would reflect ill on him.

"Dumbledore," Harry answered, watching Riddle's face closely. It twitched at the name.

"What does he want with you?" asked Avery.

"I have no idea," Harry lied, choosing to look at the boy who'd asked and away from Riddle. Hopefully a lack of eye contact would mean his lie could go unnoticed. "He just wrote telling me that he wants to arrange some sort of meeting later in the week."

"He probably wants to put you ahead in his class, too," Dorea suggested. There was something about the way she said it. Almost like the words were stones and she was hurling them at someone --- Riddle, most likely, though she seemed entirely nonplussed.

"I think that's unlikely," she answered. "If they wanted to make any class adjustments, they would have done it by now. That would be quite the adjustment for anyone in the middle of a school year and with half the time to prepare for a new set of exams."

"Pavonis here might be good enough to pull it off," said Avery, turning towards Harry. "Favourite subject of yours?"

Harry smiled tightly. "One of them. We had a good instructor back at Ilvermorny. It was one of the school's better subjects."

"They need some of those if they're to make up for their appalling lack of focus in Ancient Runes and Arithmancy," Riddle said dryly.

"Not the two subjects I'd have left out of a curriculum had I been the one planning it," said Rookwood.

"I wouldn't have left anything out." It was perhaps the least surprising thing Riddle had ever said.

"Not even Astronomy?" Dolohov asked, speaking for the first time since Harry had joined them. Neither he nor Mulciber had done anything outwardly antagonistic, but Harry could tell that there was still tension on both of their parts.

"Astronomy has its uses whether you like to admit it or not."

"Like what?" Harry was shocked by Elena's boldness. It was perhaps the first time he could remember her willingly speaking in Riddle's presence, and inquiring off the back of her question, no less.

"Archaic magic. Astrological alignment has significance in certain facets of ancient magic. The type that doesn't use wands or other conduits."

"Rituals." The word sounded poisonous on Dorea's tongue.

Harry had never heard the term rituals used in relation to magic other than in his own head. That was what he had deemed the process Reginald Gress had used to fix his eyesight, but whether it was proper or not, he had never known.

"Among other things, yes," Riddle agreed.

Rituals... that was something to remember. Harry had plenty of other things on his plate, but something about that word called to him. If he was right in assuming one of them had been used to fix his eyes, he wondered what else such magic could do.

***Some time later, in an abandoned classroom...***

Harry, Dorea, and Elena tagged along with Riddle and her posse that morning. They did nothing interesting --- only lope around the library and discuss classes and occasionally the war. None of their chatter interested Harry, but he would have rathered it lasted longer. His two real friends watched him throughout and he could tell that a confrontation would come at the first available opportunity.

Sure enough, Dorea grabbed Harry by the arm and began dragging him through the halls as soon as they were free of the larger group.

"Oi!" Harry hissed, but Dorea paid him no heed.

She stormed down the hall without a backwards glance. Harry noticed that Elena failed to speak up in his defence; only following silently behind them, biting her lip as she went.

They kept walking until they came to the first abandoned classroom. Dorea shoved Harry inside with so much force that he stumbled and almost fell. Harry waited for the accusation. He waited for her to accuse him of lunacy or bellow at him for abandoning his senses. Perhaps she would even try to curse him. Would he stop her? No, he didn't think he would. Any reaction she had would be reasonable. Harry had no high ground here. He could do little but wait with dread and accept whatever came his way.

Nothing during his year in the past had surprised him more than what happened next. Dorea's lips moved and Harry waited for them to part, waited for the rush of bellowed curses to fly from them and strike him harder than any bludger.

"What's changed?"

Harry gawked at her. "What---"

"Oh, don't play coy with me. You're too smart to have fallen into Riddle's hands like the others. You're not interested in her and I doubt she has any blackmail material on you." Dorea placed her hands on her hips and straightened her posture, tilting her head to the side.

"I don't---"

"You were avoiding her before, but now that we're back, it's different. What did she do over the holidays? Something problematic enough to want to infiltrate her circle of friends? What are you trying to accomplish?"

Sometimes, it felt to Harry like his two female friends had some kind of telepathic link. This train of thought seemed foreign for someone like Elena, but she appeared entirely unsurprised. It was like the two of them had rehearsed this spiel, but that was impossible --- Harry had been with them for every second since they took their seats with Riddle's circle for breakfast.

Leave it up to Dorea to come up with something like this. It would have been a scheme worthy of a Black, but she overestimated him. Harry *had* fallen prey to one of Riddle's traps, and he had not been sharp enough to find his way out. Frankly, he counted himself fortunate to have gotten as much from the agreement as he had. He might even win the bargain long-term... assuming that it didn't backfire so poorly before then that its long-term implications ceased mattering at all.

The only thing that had changed was that Riddle had stopped toying with him and moved in. Harry had been manoeuvred into place the second that had happened and he opened his mouth to say as much, but paused.

*"Oh, don't play coy with me. You're too smart to have fallen into Riddle's hands like the others. You're not interested in her and I doubt she has any blackmail material on you."*

Dorea was stubborn --- perhaps the most stubborn person Harry knew who was not named Dursley; though he supposed none of the ones he had known were born quite yet. Perhaps he could affect the timeline in such a way that they never were.

Merlin, that thought had grown dark. What was getting into him? Harry hated the Dursleys, but never had he thought so grimly before --- not even whilst under their tender mercy on Privet Drive.

Morbid thoughts aside, there was a very real possibility that Dorea would refuse to believe him. She had a belief in mind and a standard she held Harry to. Him failing to meet those was something Harry doubted she could imagine. Trying to convince her otherwise might well be as useless as arguing with his primary school teachers, trying to convince them he was blameless for whatever Dudley had accused him of that week.

Or...

Or, it could be worse. If Dorea could not imagine Harry failing to live up to those standards, what if he did convince her? Would she turn her back on him? Would he have disappointed her and squandered a friendship he had cherished?

No --- that thought was unbearable; it was a possibility Harry would not chance.

"The party," he managed to get out, using the first lie that sprang to mind. It was a disturbingly convincing one. It seemed Harry had changed more since arriving here than he had realized. He supposed lying about his identity for months on end would make him a better liar than he ever had been.

"The party?"

"Slughorn's. When Elena and I stumbled across her at the table, she tried to use Legilimency on me. I want to know what it is she wants and what to do about it."

***January 15, 1943***

***The Dungeons***

***11:24 PM***

Something had clicked the night Charlus first advised Harry to vary his attacks. The duels had grown much more competitive ever since. Tonight, Harry had almost beaten Charlus. It had only been in one of their duels and the Potter heir had still come out on top, but it had been a near thing. Harry hoped that by the end of the year, he would be able to match Charlus's prowess, especially when he had Dumbledore's tutelage to lean on.

After being followed and cornered by Riddle, Harry had considered telling Charlus about the Room of Requirement, but something gave him pause. The same something that reared its ugly head every time he considered telling Dorea or Elena. It was difficult to explain, but it felt wrong somehow. That room was Harry's escape --- surely he was entitled to some secrets that weren't damning? Some secrets that he chose not to share as opposed to having no choice in the matter at all.

Thoughts of the room faded the further Harry got from the seventh floor and new ones arose. Dorea and Elena had taken his story without question earlier in the week and even tagged along with him and Riddle's group of friends more often than not, but Harry could see they were not welcomed as readily as he. Elena specifically --- being a Black naturally afforded Dorea a certain amount of leniency.

Harry wondered as he reached the bottom of the stairs leading into the dungeons and stepped into a deep pool of shadow why everything had to be so complicated. He'd hoped to escape that after being driven from his own reality, but things here were even more complex. He could not have said six months ago how something could be more complex than scheming dark lords, escaped mass-murderers who actually turned out to be innocent, and ancient secrets long forgotten, but it turned out such things were indeed possible.

Harry faltered when he saw movement from the shadows and suddenly, his path was impeded by two older boys. He recognized one at once, for he was nearly a doppelgänger of Lucius Malfoy --- the father of Harry's fiercest school rival. The other took a moment, but Harry remembered him standing alongside Abraxas whilst verbally sparring with Riddle.

"Nott, Malfoy?"

"Good evening, Pavonis," Abraxas drawled, leaning leisurely against the wall with his hands in his pockets. If one of them was not clasped around his wand, Harry would snog Riddle in front of the school. "Arriving late, are we?"

Harry held his tongue. Abraxas was a prefect, but his friend was not. Nott wouldn't have accompanied him had he been doing his prefect rounds and even if he had, Harry doubted Abraxas was the type to hand Slytherins detention for being out past curfew.

Unless...

"Are you quite all right?" Abraxas asked, eyes narrowing. "You look troubled."

Harry must have scowled when the thought of bigotry came to mind. If there were any muggleborns in Slytherin, Harry had no doubt at all Abraxas would happily have given them detention and worse. The thought made him sick, but now was not the time to show it. Harry had told anyone who asked that he was a halfblood. It was a believable middle ground. People like Malfoy and especially Nott would still look somewhat down on him, but there would be no blatant discrimination. Harry could live with that.

"I'm fine," he said, "just tired."

"Late night studying?" asked Nott.

"Something like that, yeah."

"I can't help but notice the company you've been keeping lately, Pavonis." Abraxas spoke quietly and his voice was perfectly polite, but Harry could sense the edge hidden somewhere within.

"What about it?" Harry asked. "The rest of the house seems to hang off Riddle like she's royalty. You won't catch me going that far."

"Which means you have more sense than the rest. The problem is that you should never have dirtied yourself with the mudblood at all."

Harry almost let his eyes widen. Was Abraxas trying to scare him, or was he really working against Riddle behind the scenes? Harry would not have guessed so after their confrontation in the common room, but perhaps he was stubborn. Draco certainly had been in his own time.

"Isn't she a halfblood?" Harry asked carefully.

Nott sneered. "She says so; that doesn't mean it's true."

"You can do better than her, Pavonis," said Abraxas. "You were doing well. An alliance with Fawley was a good start, then to bring in Black was even better. Don't throw away all of that progress by associating with people like Riddle."

Abraxas had pushed off the wall and leant closer to Harry, looming menacingly over him with his grey eyes flickering in the dark corridor like raging storm clouds.

Harry considered giving him the same story he had given Dorea or Elena, but he bit his lip at the last second. These two could not be trusted. For all he knew, they were trying to set Riddle against him the same way they wanted Harry against her. All they had to prove his blood status was his word, after all. The last thing he wanted was for his devised cover story getting back to Riddle.

Which meant that there was only one way forward.

"Thanks for the advice. I appreciate the thought."

"I am a prefect, it's my duty to ensure that students make wise long-term decisions."

"That's the thing, though," Harry went on. "I think I'm making a perfectly intelligent decision."

Nott's eyes flashed. "By befriending a good-for-nothing mudblood?"

"Good-for-nothing?" Harry raised an eyebrow. If there was one thing that would bolden him, it was what Nott had just said. "She might be the most talented student Hogwarts has ever seen. Where exactly do you get the idea that she's good-for-nothing?"

"So you're using her?"

Harry shrugged. "Maybe I am, maybe I'm not. That's my business, not yours."

"You would do well to treat us with more respect," Abraxas said in that silky smooth way of his.

Harry stepped around him. "And you would do well to stay out of my way. I don't appreciate it, and I doubt Riddle would, either."

Harry expected a curse to follow him, but none did. There weren\'t even any words thrown his way. Harry left nothing in his wake but ominous silence and somehow, that made him even more wary.

**Chapter 21: New Wrinkles**

***January 16, 1943***

***Albus Dumbledore's Office***

***8:30 PM***

"Ah, Master Pavonis, right on time. Please, sit down."

Harry stepped forward as if in a dream. Any time he thought about Dumbledore's office, he still conjured up images of the circular tower room, decorated with ornate trinkets the likes of which Harry had seen nowhere else. Some of them were already dotted around his more mundane office in this time, but many had yet to be added. Harry couldn't help but notice the golden instruments he had seen puffing smoke during second year were absent, as was his phoenix, Fawkes.

Harry wasn't sure what felt stranger as he took his seat across from Dumbledore --- the fact that he was here at all and not lording over the school as headmaster, or the fact that he was about to personally instruct Harry in magic. It almost felt wrong. They had not spoken terribly often in Harry's time, but the youth had felt a connection there. A much stronger one than the nonexistent version he shared with Dumbledore now. The idea that he was being taught now and not then felt unnatural. Harry couldn't help but remember Dorea's words about why Dumbledore might want to teach Harry Transfiguration, and a part of him wondered whether they held any truth.

*"A man like Albus Dumbledore would never settle for equal. I think he wants to train you to be her better."*

Was that even possible? Harry had witnessed Riddle duelling in Merrythought's class. She was a whirlwind --- easily the most talented duellist Harry had ever seen. People spoke about her like she was some kind of goddess. Harry was making incredible progress and lately, he had begun to hope Dumbledore was right. Now that the time for the real work had come, he felt doubts creeping back into his mind and nesting in its shadowy corners, watching and waiting for their time to strike.

"Thanks for inviting me, Professor," Harry answered Dumbledore, bowing his head and hoping none of his thoughts had shown across his face.

Dumbledore smiled. That sight too was odd. The lines in his face that Harry remembered had not yet appeared and those that had were comparatively shallow and vibrant. "Think nothing of it. I am a teacher; passing my talents onto the next generation of magicians is my passion."

Harry bit his lip. Dumbledore wouldn't answer in a way that would confirm or deny Dorea's assumption, but he had to ask regardless. "Sir, can I ask a question?"

Dumbledore smiled thinly. "You just did, but you may ask another." Déjà vu slammed into Harry like a wall of concussive force. Suddenly, he was no longer in that room sitting across from his auburn-haired professor. He was in a darker room with barren walls and long-forgotten furniture --- a room housing a mirror that still haunted Harry's dreams.

*"Sir --- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\"*

*\"Obviously, you\'ve just done so,\" Dumbledore smiled. \"You may ask me one more thing, however.\"*

That had been in a different time, in a different world, and with two different people. Yet it felt so much like that day all over again and suddenly, for the first time in months, Harry wished for all of this to end and for a return to the life he once had.

He crushed the thought just as quickly. There was nothing to return to. Hermione was gone and so was Sirius. Voldemort was on his way back to power; and if Harry was unsure he'd have time to match Riddle in this world, he would never have had a chance in his own. No, it was better here, painful as that thought might be.

"Sir, I was curious why you chose me specifically."

"Were you?" Dumbledore asked, running a hand through his long auburn beard. "Tell me, Master Pavonis, why is it that you wonder?"

Harry stumbled blindly for an answer. "I... well, there are plenty of students here, aren't there?"

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled in that maddening way of his. "Indeed there are."

"Well... there must be something different about me, then?"

"Indeed there is. I believe we have spoken about it to some degree already."

"Is it just that I'm good at Transfiguration?"

"You have a natural flair for it, the likes of which I've scarcely seen. That is not simply being good at Transfiguration. A man only has so much time to give even if he wished he had much more of it. I wish to pass along all that I know, but few can bear that weight. You are the first in some time I have seen with such ability in my subject. It is now or never."

There was something about the way he said that. Dumbledore spoke like a man much older than he was --- like they were back in Harry's time and his hair had long since paled. This Dumbledore had half a century or more left. So why was it he spoke with such urgency in his voice?

Harry frowned, a dark thought creeping up inside his head. "Professor... are you worried about the war?"

"Worried?" Dumbledore asked. "Harry --- I do hope it is all right if I call you such?" Harry nodded. "There is very little in this world that worries me more than the war."

"They've been saying Grindelwald might attack England if the fighting in Russia keeps going the way it has."

"I think we can be relatively confident about the outcome on that particular front. The fighting looks bleaker for Grindelwald's forces every passing day. I doubt he will wait much longer before ordering a retreat, if only for now."

"You think he'll try again?"

"Oh, yes, Grindelwald is not the type of man to accept defeat so easily. It is why I'm so sure his forces will return to England in one capacity or another, though I admit, a part of me once thought us safe from him for the foreseeable future."

"So you think the rumours are true?"

"I don't know," Dumbledore admitted, looking out the window with a far-away expression. "I certainly think their forces will strike here again. Whether it is for pride or with the intention to stay, I cannot say."

"But you guess it's the second one, don't you?"

Dumbledore's lips curved upwards. "You are an inquisitive young man."

Harry blushed. "Sorry, sir, I didn't mean---"

"It's quite all right, Harry. Curiosity is not a sin, nor is being more perceptive than most your age." Dumbledore paused and brought his stare back into the room, fixing Harry with it, pinning him to his chair with the intensity of his eyes. "I do think Grindelwald will eventually try to break England just as the muggles tried several years ago. And since I know the question you are too polite to ask, I foresee myself meeting him along the way, whether by choice or otherwise."

"So you want to start passing on what you know, just in case?"

"Just in case," Dumbledore agreed, nodding slowly.

"Sir," Harry asked, "why are you telling me all this? It seems like a lot to trust me with the first time meeting."

"Perhaps," Dumbledore admitted, "but I have told you nothing you could not have deduced on your own. Nothing I have said is dangerous or can be used against me or my goals. It is trust I am placing in you in the hope that you will do likewise, and I am telling you of my intentions to justify my ambition."

Harry tilted his head. "Your ambition, sir?"

"It is my hope to have taught you the necessary components of the NEWT-level curriculum by the end of the year."

Harry spluttered, almost choking on his next breath. "The NEWT-level curriculum? Is that even possible?"

"Certainly." There was no doubt in Dumbledore's words. Just cold, hard finality. "It may seem daunting to you, but I am sure you can do it. Be warned that it will take much work on your part, but it is necessary. If I wish to pass along the more valuable pieces of the subject's complex puzzle, I must instill the basics in you as quickly as I can. Is this agreeable to you, Harry? Are you willing to work hard enough for my goals to be achievable?"

This was a very different Dumbledore. The older version's age had mellowed him and made him more passive. This Dumbledore played offensively whether he spoke his intentions truly or not. Harry found that he respected him all the more for it and was nodding before he'd much considered the offer.

"Yes, sir, I'll do anything I need to."

Dumbledore nodded, smiling. "Excellent. Now, let us begin."

***Some time later...***

Dumbledore had not been kidding when speaking of his ambitions. He had tested Harry briefly before nodding and moving on to new material. Harry had never seen any of those transformations before. Most of them were manageable, though not elegantly, but there were several that Harry would be researching before they met again.

Between lessons with Dumbledore, duelling with Charlus, practicing the same with Dorea and Elena, and now accompanying Riddle and her friends, Harry was swiftly coming to the realization that his schedule was going to be quite full. None of that was even considering the sporadic times when he would slip off to the Chamber of Secrets and spend several hours with Cerastes.

"He kept you longer than I expected."

Harry whirled and had to resist the urge to jump. Riddle was calm as ever, watching him with a small smirk and amusement dancing in her dark blue eyes. Harry hated how well that expression suited her. It was infuriating. Riddle always looked like she knew a joke no one else did. The worst part about all of it was that Harry found himself looking at her every time and wishing it would stay before berating himself for such idiocy the second it fled.

"Merlin, Riddle, don't do that!" Harry hissed.

"I probably shouldn't," she admitted, gesturing for Harry to follow as she made her way down the corridor. "I forget that not everyone is so aware of who and what's around them."

If that was supposed to mean something, it went straight over Harry's head. "Why'd you wait for me? Did you even have any idea how long I'd be?"

"Not particularly, no. Dumbledore tends to be long-winded, but I had nothing better to fill my time with."

Harry looked up at her doubtfully. "You had nothing better to do than standing outside of Dumbledore's office waiting for... however long you stood there?"

Riddle laughed softly. "It might seem to you like I was doing nothing, but trust me, that isn't true."

Harry frowned. "What were you doing then?"

"Internal exercises."

Harry waited for her to elaborate, but she didn't. "None of the others came with you?"

"I'm not sure they realized I'd be gone for longer than a few minutes. I didn't exactly advertise that I would be."

The hairs on the back of Harry's neck stood on end. Riddle had a way of unnerving him even when she had no intention of doing so. Harry could remember very few conversations with her during which he hadn't felt a pinch of nervousness rise at something she had said. This time, it was the way she said it, like she had ominous plans for him.

"You wanted to talk with me?" Harry guessed, raising an eyebrow.

"I did."

"Why? What's up?"

"Must I have a reason? You're willing to question me, willing to presume you know things without being told them. Do I need a better reason to choose you over the others?"

"I guess not, but I have a feeling you have one anyway."

She laughed again. "I would say that you're right, but you know that already." There was a slight pause. "I couldn't help but notice the looks you've been getting from Edward Nott and Abraxas Malfoy as of late."

Did she miss nothing? Harry hadn't even noticed them looking at him any differently. He wasn't all that surprised they had been, but not even Dorea had warned him of anything this time. It was like Riddle was using some kind of magic to know what was going on at all times, like she could read people's moods, or even their...

Harry almost smacked a hand against his brow. Legilimency --- there was a very real chance that she had gleaned the truth via Legilimency. "I don't suppose you've gone poking around in anyone's heads lately?"

She smiled. "You'd be harder pressed to find a week I hadn't than one I had, but no one who's important; nothing more than practice."

"So what gave it away, then? Nobody else has mentioned anything?"

Riddle's smile widened, amusement dancing in her eyes again. "I never told you that I hadn't used Legilimency. Just that I hadn't gone poking around in people's heads."

Harry scratched his head and idly began ruffling his hair, suddenly realizing how little he actually knew about the Mind Arts. "Isn't that what Legilimency is?"

"It's only a facet," said Riddle. "That is the majority of what people would call Active Legilimency. Passive Legilimency is more complex. I have a natural gift that others can't match. I don't need to actively legilimize people to learn what the general idea of what they're thinking is. I can't pick out thoughts just by standing near them, but moods are simpler, and emotions easier still."

Harry fought against his grimace. Legilimency was quickly becoming the kind of magic he despised most. It explained much about how Riddle always seemed to know what everyone was thinking and what all was going on.

"I'm guessing you've never explained this to anyone else, have you?"

"Not exactly. Cassiopeia and I have spoken about it, but she has some foundation in the Mind Arts already, so I was explaining nothing new."

Why was it that tonight, people who Harry expected to be secretive were overextending themselves to give him useful pieces of information? "So why tell me?" he asked. "That seems like a big advantage to give away?"

"Is it? Your Occlumency is stronger than anyone else's I've encountered. I glean emotions from you, but little more. Besides," she said, smiling again, "why would I keep secrets from an ally and friend?"

If Riddle truly considered Harry her friend, he would throw himself from the Astronomy Tower. "And because you thought that by opening up, I might tell you about Nott and Malfoy?"

"You're learning," Riddle praised, reaching over and patting Harry on the shoulder. If she felt the muscles tense beneath her fingers, she was unbothered by it. Harry wished she was less fond of touching people. Well, touching him, anyway; he couldn't actually remember a time she'd touched anyone else. That was odd.

"It was nothing, really," he said after recovering. "They told me I shouldn't be hanging around with you."

"Did they?" Riddle asked, twirling a lock of raven hair. Harry nodded. "And what did you tell them in return?"

Harry wondered whether she was just fishing for praise or whether she wanted to see how he answered. He suspected the latter, though a dark lady being vain enough to care for the former would make a degree of sense as well.

"I asked them why not considering you're the best student in the school."

"I'm sure they were thrilled to be reminded," Riddle said through soft gales of laughter. She was so odd. Charming and polite yet shamelessly confident, almost arrogant. *No,* Harry thought, *not almost; absolutely arrogant.*

Harry shrugged. "I don't really care what they thought of it. It's true and they don't need to know my reasons. That's my business, not theirs."

They walked in silence for a moment. "I think you might find that they disagree with you."

Harry scowled. "Let them. It means nothing to me."

"You're a strange wizard, Harry. So wary of a girl not yet passed her OWLs, yet so confident against two of the school's upperclassmen."

"Age doesn't matter," said Harry, knowing that it was true. How many seventh years could have dealt with the basilisk or fought off a hundred dementors? "We both know you'd school both of them."

"I don't imagine they would find you an easy target, either."

"Maybe. Who knows?"

"I certainly hope we have no reason to find out," said Riddle, placing a hand on Harry's shoulder again. Her grip was tighter this time, almost... protective? "If they trouble you, come to me. I'll deal with both of them if that happens."

It... did sound protective, but that made no sense. Why on earth would Riddle want to protect him? Every time Harry thought he was making progress at piecing her together, she showed a new wrinkle that changed the game entirely.

The oddest thing about it all, Harry reflected as their footsteps echoed in the otherwise silent halls, was that after considering it, he really did believe that Riddle would protect him if the circumstance arose, and Harry found himself entirely unsure how to feel about that.

***January 18, 1943***

***The Third Floor***

***4:03 PM***

Harry knew that the students nearby were watching him even without looking. He and the fifth-year Slytherins had just finished up another round of monthly duels in Defence Against the Dark Arts. Harry had taken down Marianna Parkinson almost as fast as Riddle had several months earlier. Of course, that was only because Riddle had taken the time to toy with her whilst Harry had not, but it was still whispered of among the students in class.

"Are you sure you still want that rematch, Dolohov?" Rosier asked with a smirk, eyes cutting between Harry and the pale-faced Dolohov, who scowled.

"Whenever Pavonis is willing to offer it," he said, looking at Harry with those dark, cruel eyes. Despite his inclusion in Riddle's group, there was still tension there between him and Dolohov. Mulciber seemed to have been cowed by whatever Riddle had told them, but Dolohov was more persistent.

"I'll duel you," said Harry, the eyes of the group upon him.

What was he to do? Turn him down? He would look like a coward and lose any respect he had gained since joining this circle of students. Besides, it would be a good test and better practice. Dolohov was the most skilled duellist Harry had faced, discounting Charlus. Harry would learn quickly if his improvements were as exponential as he hoped. If the duel turned violent again... well, there was no better way to practice.

"I think not," said Riddle, speaking more sharply than Harry had heard before. "The two of you duelling seems like a recipe for disaster."

"It won't degenerate like last time," Dolohov promised, "I won't let it last that long."

"I think you may overestimate yourself, Antonin," said Riddle.

Dolohov sneered at Harry. "He won't have the element of surprise on his side this time."

"And you won't be lucky enough this time to duel me while I'm doing nothing but flinging basic curses," Harry bit back, reminded painfully of all the times he had bickered with Draco Malfoy. Dolohov was infinitely more dangerous, of course, but Harry was suddenly bitter and ready to lash out against him like he'd never been able to against Draco.

"Not until both of you can calm yourselves and duel civilly." There was no room for question in Riddle's voice. Not even Dolohov spoke up, so Harry followed suit unwillingly.

Unwillingly... that was a thought, and a comforting one at that.

After all the shadowy threats Riddle posed, this exchange had proven to Harry that, if nothing else, there was still no fear of Emily Riddle inside of him. Just a healthy respect and a much less healthy bundle of conflicted emotions.

***January 21, 1943***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***9:33 PM***

"I'm going to beat you soon," Harry said through heaving breaths, noticing to his satisfaction that Charlus also looked rather worse for wear.

"You might," he admitted, regaining his breath much faster than Harry.

Harry scowled. "How do you do that?"

Charlus frowned. "Do what?"

"Recover so fast. Any time we have a duel like that, my chest feels like it's about to collapse for the next ten minutes."

"Train," Charlus said simply. "Not just your magic, but your body, too."

Harry frowned. "Isn't that a muggle thing? I didn't know witches and wizards made a habit of it."

"Most don't. Dad picked it up whilst over in Europe when he snuck off to fight in the muggles' war. I'm sure some aurors and people like that probably do it, but he'd never seen it before."

The bulk of Harry's exercise on Privet Drive had been him running from Dudley, but that only took one so far and had happened long ago. He had played Quidditch at Hogwarts, but that was just time spent sitting on a broom and even that was more than he did now. Duelling was great, but it could only happen so often. Harry could remember the sight of sweat-soaked men jogging down sidewalks in smouldering heat whilst he tended to Petunia's garden, could remember the way their breaths wheezed in unison with their heavy footfalls. None of that sounded at all appealing to Harry, but if it allowed him to keep up with Charlus, perhaps it was worth it.

"What do you do?" he asked.

Charlus shrugged. "Run, mostly. I do some other stuff now and then, but really just running. It doesn't work miracles or anything, but I'll take what I can get."

"Would you mind if I joined you for a day or two? Just to see what it's like and how miserable it is?"

Charlus waved a hand. "Come if you want. I usually do it in the mornings, though, so be warned."

Harry snorted. "I'm awake earlier than anyone in my house. I don't mind mornings; I just usually spend them in the library."

"With Riddle?"

There was a certain icy quality to Charlus's words that took Harry aback. He opened his mouth to answer but was unsure what to say. Charlus knew it, too. He opened his mouth to respond but before he could, an awful sound tore through the air and caused both of them to jump, hairs on their necks standing on end.

It was like that night with Riddle when studying runes all over again. The night Aragog had savaged Myrtle before being driven off.

Charlus reacted every bit as fast now as Riddle had then. He was armed with his wand in an instant and out the door before Harry could think. He cursed and raised his own wand, charging after his older friend and following the sound of pounding footsteps as others charged towards the same place Harry and Charlus were now bound for.

This time, there was no giant spider. Harry wondered for a moment if they had come to the wrong place, but a larger crowd had gathered and most were muttering in hushed voices.

"Stick close behind me and follow me through," Charlus muttered, pushing through the crowd and flaunting his prefect's badge to anyone who protested. Harry did as he said and before long, both of them reached the front and finally, Harry saw what had caused the screaming. Well, he saw who had likely screamed at least.

It was a girl Harry had never seen before. She was wearing Hufflepuff robes, but there were dark spots of blood over her stomach where she must have been cut. Harry could see no sign of blood still flowing, but the stain was deep like a patch of spilled wine. Harry looked over her body more closely as Charlus knelt to lift her robes and examine the damage. Something else caught Harry's attention as Charlus lifted the robes.

She appeared to be unconscious with her eyes closed and deep, shaking breaths, but her body shook and spasmed every ten or so seconds as though an electric shock had been sent up her spine. Harry frowned as he looked at her, trying to imagine what could do something like that. He had never seen anything like it.

Except... that wasn't true. He had never seen anything like it when he'd landed here in the summer, but that had changed all the way back in September when Professor Merrythought had demonstrated three disturbing curses.

"Merlin," Harry heard Charlus mutter from his spot on the floor as though he was reading Harry's mind. "I think she's been tortured."

**Chapter 22: True Power**

***February 7, 1943***

***The Grounds of Hogwarts***

***7:51 AM***

Deep, wracking coughs tore from Harry's lungs. His legs trembled underneath him with every footstep or rise of his chest. One of his hands was clutching at a stitch in his side whilst the other palmed the back of his head in a vain attempt to bring more air into his still-burning lungs.

"You're evil," he gasped at Charlus. He was also breathing heavily, but he looked a fair bit better than his younger friend.

He even managed a smile. "That's about what I thought when my dad convinced me to start running."

"To hell with that," said Harry, "you look fine."

Charlus laughed, but his laughter devolved into his own fit of coughing. "It still hurts like hell," he promised, "just less than when I first started. I've also just learnt to deal with it. It's hard to explain."

Harry knew that was true, but it was difficult to think that way when his entire body was screaming in protest. Telling himself he was going to start mimicking Charlus's regimen was one thing. He had always laughed at the reports by Dudley's teachers, all telling Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia that their son needed to lose weight. Now, Harry found them less amusing. If Dudley had not been so much of a bastard growing up, Harry might even have pitied him. There were very few people he would wish this pain upon.

"And how long is that going to take?" he asked.

"I'd tell you if I could, but I think it's different for everyone."

Harry scowled. "How long did it take for you?"

"I can't remember. There wasn't a specific day when it all just came together. A few months, I guess? It's still getting easier now; it's not like I'm done, or anything."

Harry wanted so badly to flop down on the frozen earth, but he resisted. He had overdressed and the last thing he wanted was for his sweat to freeze and become more arduous to deal with.

"We should get back up to the castle," said Charlus, "breakfast is starting soon."

The bastard sounded like he had most of his breath back as he turned towards the castle. Harry scowled at his back, but the expression swiftly became a grimace when he hastened his pace to match that of the taller sixth year.

"I hate you," Harry muttered, causing Charlus to laugh.

"If you hated me, I doubt we'd still be talking like we are."

Harry glared. "Maybe I just want to use you for this kind of stuff. You know, become a better wizard, trounce you, then stab you in the back whenever it's convenient for me."

Charlus eyed him carefully. "I suppose it wouldn't surprise me considering the company you keep."

Harry frowned. "What's wrong with Dorea and Elena?"

"Nothing, so far as I can tell."

"Then what---"

"They weren't who I was talking about." It took Harry a moment to realize that Charlus was talking about Riddle and the crowd she kept. The thought had not registered right away, for Harry still had long to go before he considered any of them friends.

He doubted that would ever happen, and none of them had even inched towards making him reconsider that stance yet. Riddle had been helpful, but she herself had spoken about how she manoeuvred the pawns all around her. This was no different; Harry was not too blind to see exactly what was going on.

He glanced from side to side, but no one else appeared out on the grounds. That was hardly a surprise. The morning was warmer than most this time of year, but heavy snowflakes were falling with such frequency that the world before them appeared half-hidden behind a misty veil.

Charlus continued watching him. "There's something you're not telling me, isn't there?"

"There's something I haven't told anyone other than Elena and Dorea." Harry let that statement hang, but Charlus's eyes did not leave him. Harry sighed internally; he had hoped that would be enough to assure Charlus or sate his curiosity. Trying to explain the truth was impossible, so he now had to decide exactly how to answer questions he'd hoped would never be asked.

The same answer his friends had gotten rose to Harry's lips, but he hesitated. They were Slytherins and Charlus was a Gryffindor. That was simplifying it, but the point was they were very different people. From what Harry knew of Charlus, he wasn't sure he would share Dorea's respect for someone manipulating events for their benefit or associating with an enemy for their own safety. He might see that as deceitful or even cowardly. Merlin, things had been so much easier in his own time when Harry could just answer people with the truth and not overthink responses to every second question.

What would have appeased Harry in his own time? That was the best point of reference he had. Charlus was infinitely more mature than he had ever been, but there were some similarities there. Harry could see some things that linked them and Charlus was certainly more like him than either Ron or Hermione. He would have baulked at Ron's laziness, and Hermione? Well, the two of them might actually have gotten on, but they were far from similar.

"I don't trust Riddle," he said at last. "She lurks around too much at night and treats people around her like pawns. It's like she doesn't see anyone else as people and like she's always planning something. With all that's been going on this year, the attacks and whatnot, I wanted to figure out what game she was playing."

Charlus's eyes widened. Had Harry gotten that adept at lying? He'd expected more resistance and had more planned, but it seemed suddenly unnecessary. What had he become in half a year?

"You think she's behind the attacks?" he asked in a low voice.

Harry ran a hand through his hair. That was the question, wasn't it?

He was pretty sure Aragog getting free had been nothing more than a freak accident. The acromantula hadn't been seen since and Harry had been with Riddle at the time of the attack. He doubted she had enough control over a monster like that to preemptively set it loose.

The most recent attacks were more up in the air. There had been two more after the incident involving the Cruciatus Curse. They had been less severe, but each victim wound up in the hospital wing with no idea who had cursed them. Riddle had been unaccounted for during each attack and Harry was beginning to grow uneasy. All of the targets had been muggleborn; was it possible she had proceeded with her blood purity campaign even without Cerastes or access to the Chamber of Secrets?

The problem was that Harry didn't know. Riddle had said already she cared little for blood supremacy, but could Harry trust her word? He doubted it; not when a version of her from his own time had fought a war over that very thing.

It was all maddening. Harry had briefly felt as though he was in control. Everything had felt right when he had opened the Chamber of Secrets and taken command of Cerastes. Then, Riddle had begun advancing and struck so decisively that Harry had been without a defence. Ever since then, it felt like he was a puppet dancing on strings yet again.

Yet what could he do? Tailing Riddle was unlikely to work, and even if it did, she or her friends would surely pick up on the pattern. What would happen then? Harry was still not ready to fight someone like Riddle and he could only imagine what she might do to him. Dumbledore might believe him but in his own time, he had been unable to convince Armando Dippet of Riddle's wrongdoing. The ancient headmaster seemed extremely fond of her here as well, so Harry failed to see why that fact would change.

"I don't know," Harry said with a frown. "That's the problem. Even if she's doing it, I'd rather know."

Charlus nodded. "I'll keep an eye on her," he said after a moment's pause. Harry looked up, wide-eyed. "What?" Charlus asked with a smirk. "Did you think I was afraid of her like the rest of the school?"

The worst part about it was the way he genuinely sounded amused. Harry worried for Charlus then. There were some people who just rightfully inspired fear in others. In some cases, standing so boldly against them without knowledge or preparation was not brave, but foolish.

"Thanks, Charlus, just... be careful, yeah?"

He grinned. "Only if you do the same in return."

Harry forced a smile and agreed, unable to shake the feeling he had just doomed at least one of them to the whims of fate.

***That night, at dinner...***

The Great Hall was abuzz with conversation the second Harry stepped through the doors. In his own time, his mere presence often achieved that effect, but here, it was different. He wondered exactly what had caused it as he moved towards the Slytherin table, flanked by Elena and Dorea, and took a seat with Riddle and her posse.

That arrangement had become the norm as of late. Harry was discontent with that, but there was little to do for now. Hopefully, an opportunity to permanently split from the group would present itself in time. Perhaps Riddle was the one behind the attacks and this time, Harry would manage to prove it. That would remove her from the castle and free him from her manipulations. It was the best-case scenario, but it was one Harry did not dare hope for.

"What has everyone so riled up?" Harry asked, taking his now customary seat across from Riddle.

"Did you not read the paper this morning?" Rosier asked.

"Not unless he read it somewhere else. Harry was absent from breakfast this morning."

Merlin, was there nothing Riddle missed? Her attention to detail was infuriating. How was Harry ever supposed to pull one over on a person incapable of making mistakes?

*No,* a small voice said in the back of his head, *not incapable. She made a mistake by not opening the chamber sooner, and she made a mistake by legilimizing you at Slughorn's party. She's just better at recovering than most people.*

That was true. Even in Harry's own time, Voldemort had made mistakes. Overlooking his mother's sacrifice not once, but twice chief amongst them. Yet on both occasions, he had rebounded in one way or the other, just like the younger, female version of him that now sat across the table from Harry.

"I was practising," he said in response to the questioning stares, pointedly not saying exactly what it was he had been practising. He suspected revealing he had been exercising in a muggle fashion alongside Charlus Potter would start an impromptu duel.

"Grindelwald has officially retreated from Russian soil." Harry did not miss the way Riddle watched his face when she spoke. He tried to keep it as impassive as possible. "The muggles pulled out days ago, but some of Grindelwald's forces stayed behind to cover their retreat."

That certainly explained the nervous energy surging through the hall. Even Dumbledore believed Grindelwald would march on Britain if the offensive failed, and now it had. That was interesting. The Germans had retreated around the same time during Harry's own timeline, so did this mean other events would play out in the same way? Could it be that Dumbledore was wrong about Grindelwald's plans? Could it be that the woman across from Harry would develop into Voldemort the same way Tom Riddle had in his world?

No, that part was unlikely. She may well become Voldemort, but Harry had disrupted the flow of things with his stunt involving the Chamber of Secrets. Some facets of Riddle's life would be different here, whether it was for better or worse.

"I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens," Harry said, suspecting the crowd around him was waiting for an answer.

"It seems so," Riddle agreed. "It will certainly be interesting to see how events play out. For now, I'm just trying to stay focused on relevant events that I can control. Speaking of which," she said, leaning a bit closer to Harry across the table, "you plan on visiting Hogsmeade this Saturday, yes?"

Harry forced his eyes not to widen. He hadn't even realized there was a Hogsmeade weekend this Saturday; it was something he had spent no effort keeping track of since his arrival here. He ought to have. If he had, perhaps he would have had a viable excuse to not attend with Riddle and her posse. As it was, he had no such thing, so he could do little more than nod, seething internally at the small smile on Riddle's face as she turned to engage Cassiopeia in conversation. Why was it she won so often?

***February 12, 1943***

***Hogsmeade***

***4:13 PM***

The day in Hogsmeade had actually been better than Harry dared hope for. Riddle had done nothing out of the ordinary. Their large group had just traipsed around the village like normal students. It was almost easy to forget the situation Harry found himself in. What, with the sweet taste of butterbeer, the heavenly smell of Honeydukes chocolate, and the talk and laughter of several hundred bustling students? All felt next to normal.

Almost.

It was impossible to feel completely at ease around Riddle, at least for Harry. She had an ominous gravity to her that pulled at his awareness. The way almost everyone in their group bent to her every whim was subtle to most but obvious to Harry, who was watching for it all the while. The way she moved, smiled, and laughed, always at the perfect moment; everything was just so plainly orchestrated by Riddle the whole journey, even though Harry suspected he was the only one to realize. Well, him and Dorea, perhaps.

It was another snowy day to cap off a snow-filled week. It crunched and gave way beneath Harry's feet but all that was revealed was more of it below. Banks of it rose high on either side of Hogsmeade's twisting main road, obscuring some of the shop windows from view of those on the banks' other side. There was more snow than Harry could ever remember seeing. He wondered if that was a coincidence or whether global warming really had been as impactful as some media sources had begun to suggest fifty years from now. That thought brought a small smile to Harry's lips. Uncle Vernon would be livid if they were proven right; Harry could remember a number of his rants any time the topic arose.

"This way," Riddle said, moving towards one of the unoccupied carriages waiting near the edge of the village.

"Pick a different direction," came a drawling voice from up ahead. Harry saw several members of this group reach for their wands. He was forced to step up beside Riddle to see what was happening; she was still much taller than him and had been blocking his view.

Abraxas Malfoy stood arm in arm with a raven-haired girl Harry had seen off and on in the Slytherin common room. It took him a moment to remember who she was, but the answer came when he glanced back at the posse around him and Riddle. There were remarkable similarities between this girl and one in their number and that was when Harry realized the girl was Virgo Parkinson: older sister of Marianna. She reminded Harry more of Pansy than her younger sister. Both sisters had a perpetually haughty look about them, but Virgo had an air of condescension her younger sister lacked. Her posture was stiff, her eyes were uncaring, her expression contemptuous.

Another dark-haired girl --- Travers, Harry thought her name was --- stood beside Edward Nott, who sneered at the lot of them in a way that reminded Harry painfully of his former Potions Master.

A beat of silence stretched between the two groups. "There are plenty of other carriages, Abraxas," Riddle said softly. "Why don't you pick one of them?"

"I could ask the same thing of you," he returned.

"You could, but that would be quite rude of you. Courtesy dictates ladies first, does it not?"

"Do not dare reference customs that are above your station," Nott hissed, his own hand drifting towards his wand. Harry tensed, ready to summon his own. He almost did when something brushed his arm. Realizing it was Riddle did not help but a split-second later, Harry pieced together what it meant --- she wished for him to remain unarmed.

"Can you cite to me a law that dictates who can and cannot abide by ancient customs, Edward?" Riddle asked, a smile in her voice. "Is it not those customs you cling so desperately to in your crusade to justify the importance of blood and its purity?"

"You dare?" Nott hissed, properly going for his wand now.

Malfoy grabbed hold of his wrist before he could. Riddle's signal to Harry had been subtle, but this was anything but. "She's right, of course," he said with a stiff bow. "Take the carriage, Riddle; I had only hoped you would be gracious enough to step aside. Virgo is quite displeased by the cold and I had hoped to get her out of it at."

"They're going to be trouble," Harry muttered as they moved away, walking towards one of the other carriages some fifteen metres away.

"No," said Riddle, "they won't be, but they'll certainly try."

***February 18, 1943***

***Albus Dumbledore's Office***

***9:24 PM***

"This is marvellous work," Dumbledore praised, holding up a conjured mirror for Harry to see the fruits of his labour. He had been tasked with colouring his eyebrows blond. Several weeks ago, Harry would have baulked at the idea. That was human transfiguration --- something that was not normally covered until a student's sixth year N.E.W.T class.

The last several weeks had changed Harry's perspective, though. Both he and Dumbledore had known he had a natural talent for Transfiguration, but neither of them had realized quite how far that stretched. Harry had breezed through the fifth-year material with such speed, he began to think mastering the N.E.W.T.-level magic by the end of the year might actually be easy. It was a stark contrast to how he had felt the moment Dumbledore announced having Harry do just that was his intention.

Harry had backed down on that a little bit in the last week or so. Mastering this --- the first minor introduction to human transfiguration --- had been exponentially more difficult than anything else Dumbledore had tasked Harry with. It was extraordinarily challenging and Harry swiftly found his confidence waning.

Yet here it was --- proof that perhaps, he really was as talented as he had believed a little over a week ago.

"This truly is remarkable," Dumbledore was saying. "Why, I'm unsure if I've ever taught anyone with such skill."

Harry felt himself swell with pride, but he forced the feelings down. He would not allow himself that victory unless his next question was answered in a very particular way.

"Sir, does that include Riddle?"

There was something in Dumbledore's eyes for a moment, but it was gone faster than the mirror he vanished a second later. "I think so, yes," he said, and only then did Harry let his joy spread. *This* was his calling. Here was something he outstripped even Riddle in. At long last, Harry had an advantage; now, it was about widening the gap and finding ways in which that advantage could be leveraged in his favour.

"You seem pleased to hear that," Dumbledore observed, voice measured.

"Yes, sir," Harry admitted.

Dumbledore furrowed his brow. "May I ask why?"

"It's complicated, sir."

"I see." Harry thought Dumbledore looked oddly troubled. Had he said something wrong? "You best be getting back to your common room," he said. "Next time we meet, I plan to begin teaching you something more challenging than anything we have covered thus far."

"Can I ask what that is, sir?"

"You may."

It took Harry a moment to realize what Dumbledore had just said. When he did, he blushed, but soldiered on. "What will you be teaching me next week, Professor?"

"I will begin attempting to teach you non-verbal spellcasting." Harry's eyes widened. "Be warned," Dumbledore continued, "that this particular facet of magic takes most sixth years the best part of that school year to master. My hope is that you will be casting spells without incantations by the year's end, but I do not expect this to happen overnight."

"I can't wait, sir."

***Minutes later...***

Harry noticed something odd the moment he strolled into the Slytherin common room. Riddle and her group were sitting in their usual spots, but they were more tightly pressed together, almost as though encircling a central point. Harry frowned and made his way over, focusing on all senses to try and puzzle out whether something obvious was out of the ordinary.

That something obvious revealed itself when he took a seat between Dorea and Elena, who were sitting as far away from Riddle as possible. Riddle herself was their central point --- or, she was one of them, anyway. The group's leader was crouched over Marianna, a hand on her shoulder as the girl sobbed.

"What's up with her?" Harry whispered to Dorea, who was watching the whole ordeal with an expression so detached any Black lord would be proud.

"No idea," Dorea whispered back. "She burst in a few minutes before you and has been bawling ever since. Riddle's only now getting her to calm down a bit." If this was Dorea's idea of calmed down, Harry feared to imagine what Marianna had looked like when she had first entered their circle.

"What is it?" Riddle was asking, speaking more softly than Harry had ever heard before. She was rubbing wide circles on Marianna's back, soothing the girl whose sobs were quieting.

"It's-it's..." she trailed off at the sound of the common room door opening and whimpered. Harry glanced back over his shoulder and saw the same quartet who had accosted them in Hogsmeade. They were coming straight towards them.

"Something's off here," Dorea muttered, eyes watching the same figures. Harry nodded; there was something about the purpose with which they moved. Something told Harry this would not result in Abraxas so politely backing down.

"What have they done to you?" Riddle asked, tightly clutching Marianna's shoulder. The girl just whimpered, but Riddle's grip tightened, her knuckles somehow growing paler. "Marianna..."

"Sh-she forbid me from ever speaking to you."

Everyone in the circle tensed. "She?" Harry mimed at Dorea, who gestured subtly towards Virgo. She was glaring at all of them as she, Travers, and their boyfriends drew closer.

"Can she even do that?" Harry whispered, using Marianna's renewed sobs to cover his words.

"Yes," Elena answered, looking nervous. "She's the heiress to the family. She can't decide marriages, but she can forbid relationships, at least until it's been taken up with the family's lord."

Harry's expression darkened. Merlin, he hated pureblood politics. He was pretty sure this sort of thing had been abolished by the time he'd attended Hogwarts in his own reality, but it was impossible to tell; he had been as ignorant as a newborn about things like this. It was sickening either way, as was the mere idea people would fight to defend this sort of garbage.

One way or the other, he had been right about one thing; something was about to happen and soon, for the quartet stopped feet from the outer edge of their circle, all of them looking towards Marianna.

"Marianna," snapped Virgo, "I gave you an order!"

"An order that you are going to rescind." Riddle's voice was deathly calm as she removed her hand from Marianna's shoulder and climbed to her feet, staring down the quartet with icy eyes. Harry knew that stare and its intensity well, but Merlin, Riddle had never looked at him like that...

"Be careful, Riddle," Abraxas said softly. "That sounds awfully like you're claiming Virgo can't exercise her right via the old customs."

Harry noticed for the first time how quiet the common room had grown. Nobody appeared to move, all of them transfixed by the confrontation that had been building for months. Harry noticed that many of the older students had their wands in hand. He cursed internally. This was a setup; Abraxas and his ilk had gained support for this. Everything they were doing was designed to cause a confrontation during which Riddle, Harry, and everyone else gathered around Marianna would be bludgeoned. He grimaced; this was probably going to turn ugly.

Harry began running plans through his mind. He could conjure a wall of stone without thought. That would be a solid opening move. It would at least buy everyone around him a moment to prepare themselves. If they were especially fortunate, a few of them might even be able to take down some of the attackers in the chaos.

"In this case, Abraxas, I think you'll find that she can't." Robes rustled from the corners of the room as even more wands were drawn. Cassie went for hers, as did Dolohov and Rosier. "No!" Emily said sharply. "Stand down; none of you will be harmed."

"You're bold for someone spitting in tradition's face in a room full of traditionalists," Nott sneered.

"I'm doing no such thing, Edward. I have the utmost respect for most of the traditions."

Nott's eyes narrowed. "Most of them?"

"Yes, most of them. I think you'll find that this particular tradition is based solely on the power wielded by a family's heiress."

Nott frowned, looking confused, but Malfoy stepped in again. "I know you're of questionable stock and upbringing, Riddle, but that is exactly the point."

"Well then," Riddle said pleasantly, "the premise is fundamentally flawed."

Malfoy's eyes narrowed. "How so?"

"Well, what good are customs based on power imbalances if the one who once had power suddenly becomes powerless?" Malfoy suddenly looked as confused as Nott, who was going for his wand, but both of them were too slow. **"Wake and seize them all!"**

Harry's breath caught as people gasped around him and most in the room froze. Riddle had used Parseltongue in plain sight of everyone in the common room. It was such a shock to most that many had completely stopped moving, abandoning all other plans to stare blankly at Riddle like she had tumbled from the heavens.

That was the mistake that cost them.

With a unified hiss so loud that the walls seemed to rattle, every bit of serpentine imagery came alive. All the furniture was decorated with it, so within seconds, most of Malfoy's supporters were pinned to their chairs by animated serpents who hissed and bit at those who would not yield.

**"Leave them,"** Riddle hissed to the snakes that rose up around her friends. Even they looked nervous. Elena appeared to be hyperventilating and was pale as a ghost. *Bollocks!* Harry thought as he remembered their boggart lesson from the year's beginning. This was quite literally her deepest fear.

**"Strike the other four."** Parkinson and Travers screamed as a pair of eight-foot-long snakes lunged towards them. Malfoy cursed and aimed his wand at Riddle, but Nott had turned away to help Travers. That proved to be costly, as Riddle sent an unprepared Malfoy sailing across the common room and slamming into the opposite wall with a flick of her hand. Harry's eyes widened. He had never seen anyone use magic like that before. Riddle's wand hadn't even been in her hand.

Nott's head raised at the sound, but Riddle was on him before he could move. She jerked her hand upwards and Nott was tossed up into the air and slammed so hard into the wall that Harry heard something crack. He cried out in pain and struggled, but invisible restraints seemed to hold him in place --- no matter how hard he fought against them, he was held firmly against the wall.

The entire scuffle lasted no more than half a dozen seconds. All was quiet by then as people realized struggling was futile and that every single one of them was hopelessly outmatched. Even on the winning side, Harry felt it. He tried to fight the sensation, but never before had he felt so helpless and insignificant. How had he ever planned to fight against this?

"Do all of you see the problem with the society your ancestors built now?" Riddle asked into the silence of the room. Her voice was calm and had a terrible sweetness to it that made Harry's skin crawl. "You have designed a world in which nothing matters but power. You all perceive power to mean purity of blood, but do you see what happens when someone superior shows you how meaningless your status symbols are when faced with true power?" Nobody spoke. "Allow me to demonstrate," Riddle said, crouching before Virgo, sliding a pale hand under her chin and tilting her head up so that she met Riddle's eyes. The girl looked terrified and was breathing in such a swift and shallow manner that Harry thought she might faint. "Virgo, you are going to revoke the order you gave Marianna. You will then apologize for abusing your power so grossly. If you fail to comply, I will show you just how grossly my kind of power can be abused. Do we have an agreement?"

Virgo nodded, shaking like a leaf, breaths still coming short and fast. "Good," said Riddle, patting Virgo on the cheek before standing and addressing the room once more. "You have all forgotten what true power is and how useless your symbols of status are when faced with it. How many nations centring on the purity of blood has Grindelwald conquered? How well have the traditions served those under his rule?" No one answered. "Think on all of this, because if your delusions of what real power is trouble me again, I will do more than show off. Am I understood?" Heads all around the room nodded. "Good. Now, **rest.**"

All around the room, snakes settled back into their chairs and students scrambled to their feet, rushing towards the doors. Any other night, Harry might have feared them running off to a professor, but he knew there was no risk of that. Suddenly, Harry understood exactly how Riddle had become so feared and he suspected from now on everyone in this room would be hers to do with as she pleased.

No... that wasn't quite right. Everyone in this room but him! He had become lost in her show, but he could overcome even this. He too was a Parselmouth and wandless magic was impressive, but not unbeatable.

Yes, Harry could conquer this... he just had to work out exactly how that could be done.

**Chapter 23: Oversights and Overreaches**

***February 19, 1943***

***The Room of Requirement***

***11:27 PM***

Riddle had decided to begin holding their weekly Ancient Runes lessons in the Room of Requirement. It was a decision Harry had expected since the night she had revealed the room to him, so it came as no surprise. Harry was more interested in what Riddle would craft the room into, but the answer proved disappointedly mundane. A small central fire ringed by sofas and armchairs made from aged leather, ghostly green lanterns flickering on the wall, and even the black expanse beyond a porthole on the room's far wall; Riddle had turned the room into an exact replica of the Slytherin common room.

Harry wasn't sure what he had expected. It made a measure of sense. She had grown up in a muggle orphanage, the two of them were similar in that way. Harry might have grown up with family, but he had still been isolated. The important thing was that neither of them had known a home until the age of eleven when they both had found Hogwarts. He would empathize with Riddle if that was the true reason for her choice of setting, but it just seemed entirely too mundane for someone such as her.

Their lesson proceeded much like all the others. From the way Riddle sat and spoke, one would have never known she tamed a pit of vipers the week before. Things in Slytherin had been calmer ever since. Harry had expected the common room to be insufferably tense, but there was none of that. It was like every single member of Slytherin House had seen what Riddle was capable of and given up. That or they were just completely willing to submit to the whims of anyone who declared themselves a Parselmouth.

All but Harry, who had learned from this last week. If he somehow did drive Riddle from the castle, that would leave him able to pull a similar stunt. What exactly he would do with a house under his thumb, he was unsure, but there was doubtlessly a use for such things. It would be nice to be unbothered by a quarter of the school, if nothing else.

Yet...

Damn Cerastes and his cold-minded logic. Harry valued the snake and his wisdom, but there were times when he truly wished the basilisk would have the grace to be wrong. It was especially annoying when they differed on things Harry so desperately wished could be disputed, but then Cerastes disproved his idea with a swift precision strike.

It took meaningful restraint not to scowl right there, sitting feet away from Riddle. Getting her out of the castle sounded insurmountable, but it was so much easier than denying what Cerastes had proposed was necessary. Merlin, why could the snake not just be wrong?

***Days earlier, in the Chamber of Secrets...***

**"The usurper is impressive,"** Cerastes admitted when Harry had finished telling his tale.

**"Too impressive,"** Harry hissed back. **"I don't know how I'm supposed to fight against something like that."**

Harry was left in silence for a moment. Months ago, the impulse to turn towards his companion would have been strong, but that impulse had dulled as the months went on. Looking at the basilisk would be rather unwise and would be quite the mistake seeing as Cerastes took great care to stay away from Harry's line of sight at all times.

**"Can you beat her?"**

**"In what?"**

Cerastes hissed in a low way that Harry thought indicated displeasure. It had taken some time, but finally, he was beginning to grow somewhat confident in his ability to interpret wordless hisses and what they meant. It really was a shame Parseltongue did not simply translate the intent behind such exclamations. It would make dealing with an expressive yet contemplative basilisk much easier.

**"In combat,"** Cerastes answered.

**"No,"** Harry admitted, **"not yet. She's older and more practiced than I am. I hope to become better than her someday."**

**"You will,"** the snake promised. **"Any trueborn heir to my master will surpass those of lesser blood."**

Harry's stomach twisted in uncomfortable knots. He found himself unsure what bothered him more --- the possibility Cerastes spoke those words with more behind them than pride, or the reminder of how deceitful Harry had been. Lying was something he had become skilled at this year, but that did not mean he had grown fond of it. Much the opposite, as a matter of fact. Harry found that the more proficient he became at lying, the more and more difficult he found the act became. Probably because as his skill improved, so too did the scope of his deceptions and, in some cases, blatant manipulations.

Thoughts like this made him consider Riddle's notes on Occlumency. He had been practicing to the best of his ability and making meaningful progress once the meditations Cerastes led him through began growing easy. Of course, it would be impossible to know just how far he had progressed until his skill was tested against a true legilimens. Harry doubted that he would be ready to deal with one of those any time soon, but the mastery over his own mind was coming along well. Clearing it was easier now than it had ever been before.

There was something Harry had seen later in the book about heightening control over one's own emotions. With how conflicted Harry often felt nowadays, that was a skill he would be investigating once he had a firmer base established. He might never find a willing legilimens to help him practice the defensive aspects of Occlumency, but he could at least sharpen his mind to the best of his abilities.

**"What if I don't have time to surpass her?"** Harry asked, choosing each word with great caution.

There was another unnaturally long pause before Cerastes spoke. **"You seem more convinced that the usurper is a threat."**

**"Hearing what she can do from others isn't the same as seeing it. That's changed my perspective a bit."**

**"She made no threat toward you."**

**"I would be less worried if she had."**

Harry failed to interpret what this hiss meant from Cerastes, nor did he understand why he'd suddenly begun slithering restlessly across the chamber's floor. **"You humans are illogical,"** he said after a time. **"So... perplexing."**

**"For what it's worth, I think I'm one of the stranger ones."**

**"Of course you are. No heir to my master or lord of this chamber would ever be ordinary."**

That actually drew a smile from Harry. Once, he longed to be ordinary; now he was becoming less sure. He was no longer the Boy-Who-Lived, but there were other ways in which one could stand out. Harry's abilities with magic were not ordinary. He would have scoffed at that idea in his own time, but here, it was becoming more and more obvious.

The oddest part was that lately, Harry was realizing there was more to his hunger for knowledge than the pursuit of Riddle and the destruction of any nefarious plots. He had begun to truly enjoy learning on a level Hermione might have been proud of. Every night spent in Dumbledore's office had become treasured, as had the moments Harry could slip off to the library and peruse through the Restricted Section. Those visits would now become more frequent after seeing what Riddle could do. Learning for learning's sake might have become a favourite pastime, but still, Harry kept his end goal in mind and was aware of what sort of improvements it would take to accomplish it --- now more than ever.

In his own time, Riddle had always been a concept. Frightening in the way shadowy monsters from a vague nightmare were to children. It was not the monsters themselves the children feared, but the mystery around them. The monsters too were worrying, but most often, they failed to live up to their reputation.

The latter was perhaps untrue of Riddle. Never had Harry seen anyone cast magic *without* a wand before that night, but he still much preferred knowing one could. It made everything feel real and gave him a bar to strive for, even if a blurry one. She had not revealed much, but it was enough to harden Harry's resolve. If Riddle expected to break him along with the others, she would be disappointed.

**"My question still stands,"** said Harry. **"What do I do if she becomes a threat before I can beat her?"**

Cerastes's hissing grew angry. **"I have offered to eliminate this threat many times. If you were proactive, the threat would not exist."**

Cerastes had, at that, but something always held Harry back. Something about loosing the basilisk on Riddle just felt wrong. There were some obvious moral troubles there that Harry had defaulted to as justifications earlier in the year. The more time that passed, the less certain Harry became of that reasoning. Had he not wanted to kill Voldemort, even in his own time? Had that not been his plan since entering the magical world whether he realized it or not? Had that not been what he imagined any time he pondered how Riddle would be stopped in this one if she became a problem?

Harry had realized during one of his more recent Occlumency practices that perhaps killing was not, after all, what had him so ill at ease with the idea. That only left a few things it could be. Harry thought he had isolated that list down to two.

The first was that the idea sounded much too similar to what Tom Riddle had done in Harry's world. Unleashing a monster like Cerastes against fellow students made Harry's skin crawl.

*"There are strange likenesses between us, after all. Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by Muggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself. We even look something alike."*

*No! I'm nothing like him!*

That was the heart of it though, wasn't it? The idea of being like Voldemort sickened Harry. Just thinking about doing something that would link them so closely together... The thought was unbearable.

There was more too, something... darker that Harry had only just realized when reflecting recently. Something... no! No, he would not consider that; that particular path led nowhere but down into dark chasms and deadly pits whose depths were lost to shadow.

**"And I've said no every time,"** Harry countered.

**"Foolishly, and you have never suggested any solutions of your own."**

**"My best solution sounds impossible."**

**"What is it?"**

**"Catching or framing her in something and getting her expelled from Hogwarts. That way, I wouldn't have to deal with her."**

**"Foolish."**

Harry baulked at the single word, the impulse to whirl towards the snake arising for the first time in several months. **"Foolish?"**

**"Yes, foolish."**

**"You don't think I could do it?"**

**"I think you could do it with more ease than you imagine."**

**"Then why---"**

**"It solves nothing. Removing the usurper from the castle is meaningless. She is more dangerous than most already and would do damage in the wider world. She would wait for you, and when you met her there, she would seek vengeance. If one is to strike at an enemy, the last result they wish for is to leave a more determined foe standing."**

***Back in the present...***

"Is everything all right?" Riddle asked when their work for the night was finished.

"Fine, just a bit distracted."

"You're always distracted by one thing or another. It's one of the quirks I've noticed about you. Tonight, you were just more distracted than usual."

She had him there. Harry's existence since being sent back in time could be described as a thousand questions for every answer. Distractions had been plentiful since his arrival. He idly wondered if Riddle knew how many of them were related to her. Harry doubted it. She probably suspected many, but not the true number. She would need to believe him unreasonably fixated upon her to guess such a thing and if she had, he doubted she would have gone through the effort of making sure they interacted more; she would likely have been confident it would have happened with or without her intervention.

Harry shrugged. "It's been a long week; I'm just tired."

"You seem to be busier lately," Riddle observed. Of course she had noticed that.

"I am, yeah. Dumbledore's lessons take up a night a week and I've been trying to get further ahead in most of my other classes."

"I still wonder why Dumbledore decided to tutor you in his subject."

That had clearly been bothering Riddle. Harry had chosen to reveal that soon after the lessons began. There had been no way around it. One way or the other, someone in their group would get wind of what was really going on. Better to associate with someone Riddle despised under the pretence of pragmatism than to be caught out in a needless lie.

Harry shrugged. "I think he just likes teaching, and Transfiguration is my best subject."

Riddle raised an eyebrow. "Better than Defence Against the Dark Arts?"

Harry nodded. "Definitely."

"Odd. I haven't seen you use Transfiguration in any of the duels I've watched."

Damn Riddle and her vaunted skills in observation. "I'm improving fast. I've also been trying to work on my pure duelling abilities." Riddle seemed to take that at face value. Surprised she didn't see straight through him, Harry almost gaped, but caught himself.

"I would be interested to see your work in Transfiguration one day," Riddle said, making it sound casual. Harry almost snorted.

Yes, because he was absolutely going to show Riddle exactly what he was capable of in the one subject he might actually edge her in. If Riddle had one shortcoming when it came to her manipulations, it was that, sometimes, she seemed to feel everyone was so far beneath her they would be unable to exercise any autonomy. That was going to cost her when it came to dealing with Harry.

"Maybe one day," said Harry. "I wouldn't mind seeing what you're capable of, either."

Riddle just smiled. "Maybe one day," she returned. "You know, I have grown fonder of you lately."

If Harry had been drinking water, it might have exploded out of his mouth. "Oh?"

"You're one of the few who still treat me like a human being after last week. It's refreshing."

Surely this was an act. Everything Harry knew about Riddle said that being treated as a deity or feared so completely would be some kind of life-long ambition of hers. Being treated like a human seemed like the kind of thing she would avoid at all costs. Though if she was acting, she was doing it marvellously. Not that Harry would expect anything less; it was just genuinely disconcerting.

"I'm not afraid of you," Harry answered after a pause, "I think that's the biggest difference."

Riddle's smile remained intact. "If only others shared that same point of view."

She stood and gestured to the door. Dumbledore had tutored Harry earlier that night, so they'd needed to start their runes session late. That was becoming a theme on Friday nights; they were quickly becoming the busiest and most exhausting night of Harry's week.

"Your friends seem just as affected as the rest," Riddle mused as they moved past the absurd tapestry of the madman teaching trolls ballet.

It took Harry a moment to realize exactly what Riddle was referring to. "Oh, Dorea and Elena. They're both just... introverted."

"You're introverted, both of them are far beyond that."

Harry knew he should deny it, but he was unsure if he would be able to. Lying his way out of this one was going to be difficult, especially with the memory of the last time the trio had spoken about Riddle so fresh in his mind.

***Days ago, in an abandoned classroom...***

Never had Harry seen his two best friends so on edge. Both of them had been leaping at shadows ever since Riddle's display in the Slytherin common room. Not that most of the house was any different, but these two were worse than most. That was troubling. Harry had hoped they would see past the scare tactics Riddle had employed. It would certainly make his life easier if they had. Convincing himself he could beat Riddle was much more difficult when two of the people closest to him were so awed by her displays of power.

It made sense that Elena was so shaken. Snakes had always been a fear of hers. It was especially ironic for the serpent to be both the symbol of her house and her greatest fear. There had been some mocking from some of the older students when her boggart form had been revealed, but not much of it. Slytherins quarrelled where others couldn't see, and Elena was both important enough and quiet enough to make herself an undesirable target.

That all made sense, but Harry had hoped Dorea would handle the whole thing better. The worst part about her wasn't even the paranoia; it was the fact that Harry felt her eyes on him more often than not. It was like she was planning something; Harry dreaded learning what it was.

The first time the trio was able to slip away from the rest of the group did not come until several days after Riddle's display. Dorea was the initiator, to no one's surprise, and the three of them swiftly found themselves locked up in an abandoned classroom.

Harry wasn't sure what he expected. Perhaps for Elena to break down, or for Dorea to ask what his next plan of attack was. What he certainly did not expect was for Dorea to round on him, cheeks tinged by the touch of scarlet and dark eyes shooting sparks.

"What have you done?" she hissed.

"W-what?"

"You had to get curious over Riddle, didn't you? You had to want to figure something else out. Look where that's gotten us now."

"I don't---"

"Do you think she's just going to let us slip away from her, Harry? A Black, a Fawley, and probably the next most gifted student in the school after her?"

He opened his mouth, then closed it. Part of him had expected that somehow, Riddle and the problem she posed would be solved before that became pressing. That was foolish, he realized now.

"I won't let it come to anything serious---"

Dorea laughed. "You won't let it? Harry, did you not see what she did in the common room? Not only is she a Parselmouth, but she can cast magic without a wand. The only wizard I've read about doing that is Grindelwald." She let that sink in for a moment as something solid seemed to slam against Harry's stomach, driving much of the air from his lungs.

"What are you saying?" Harry asked, his voice hoarse and resistant to his whims.

"I'm saying that you've led us into some kind of trap. I'm saying that if you would have used your brain and not rushed off like some fantastical hero, we might not be trapped in a situation none of us want to be in."

Harry's face flushed. "You were all for the idea at the time---"

"That was before I realized exactly what she was. I also thought, at the time, that you had a solid plan. Not just this traipsing through every day and hoping you stumble on something helpful."

That last bit was a slap in the face. Did Dorea not see how many hours Harry was dedicating to improving himself? Did she not realize that those hours were spent largely in the hopes of beating Riddle?

No, of course she didn't. To them, Riddle was a talented schoolgirl who would go on to do great things. Harry knew her for what she truly was, or at least, for what she may become. It was different. Telling them he was spending hours improving in the hopes of besting Riddle would just sound overdramatic. So what could he say? Harry found himself unsure that there was any lie he could tell to get himself out of this.

"You don't even have anything to say," Dorea stormed, glaring at Harry.

"Dorea," said Elena, but she didn't get far.

"No! I know you're happy to just go along with whatever Harry does, but I'm not." She turned back to face him. "Harry, you'll always be one of my best friends, but I can't be stuck so close to Riddle. There's a reason Arcturus avoids her. I think she's going to be like this for a long time, even after Hogwarts. I don't think the dangers with her stop when we graduate and I... I can't let myself be caught up in all of that."

Harry found himself too stunned to speak when Dorea leant forward to kiss him on the cheek, and his voice continued to fail him as she made her way towards the classroom door, only glancing back to deliver one final message.

"If you manage to get yourself free of Riddle, let me know. I don't want to stop being best friends with you, Harry. I just..." She looked away, unable to meet Harry's eyes and suddenly, he wondered whether there was more at play than he had originally realized.

***Back in the present...***

Every one of Dorea's words sliced across Harry's skin like a lashing whip in the dead of winter. It was the most painful thing he had gone through all year but the more time that passed, the more he thought he had been missing something. The way she had refused to meet his eyes near the end, the way her voice had broken. Dorea was not the type to cower after an argument. It was odd and out of character and slowly, the seeds of an idea were growing inside his mind.

"They didn't make the same agreement I did," Harry reminded Riddle. "I didn't agree for them, either. They have no guarantees from you."

"Yet they followed you anyway."

Harry shrugged. "I never asked them to."

"I never implied you had. I expected them to stay away. It was a welcome surprise when they didn't." She tilted her head. "Can I presume you've had a falling out with Dorea?" Harry nodded curtly. Riddle hummed to herself as they walked. "They are perfectly free to split from the group whenever they choose. I wouldn't want something so trivial to cause you stress."

Harry almost stumbled over his feet. "They are?"

"Harry, this is a social group at a school, not a secret society or ministry-funded organization. Everyone has the right to leave whenever they choose."

What remained unsaid, of course, was that Harry was not afforded that same luxury; not after the deal he had made with Riddle.

What game was Riddle playing, anyway? She would let two daughters of Sacred Twenty-Eight families just walk away so long as it meant keeping a no-name halfblood happy?

Every time Harry thought he had Riddle figured out, she showed him a new wrinkle. It never grew less disconcerting and Harry was swiftly realizing the way to beat Riddle wasn't going to be to play for a desired outcome --- it was going to be to plan for every outcome.

**Chapter 24: Beware the Heir**

***February 25, 1943***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***10:52 PM***

Harry could begrudgingly say, after more than a month of running, that Charlus had indeed been right. By no means did he never find himself winded in duels, but especially drawn-out affairs such as this particular skirmish would probably have broken him six weeks ago. There had been shorter, less intense duels during which Harry had simply lacked the energy to continue, but now he found that --- though his lungs burned and his calves ached --- he was able to keep fighting.

Charlus's Stunner came for him but Harry knew it was a feint. When he sidestepped, he brought his wand up at once, ready to deflect the inevitable follow-up curse. Harry saw Charlus's eyes narrow from across the classroom when he batted his spell aside and countered with a volley of his own. This was not the same boy Charlus had begun duelling two months ago, and he was becoming more aware of that as the duel stretched on.

Harry kept his wand moving whilst Charlus fended off his spells. This plan was one he had devised during a sleepless night spent analyzing their last round of duelling. Harry was never going to beat Charlus by only trading spells. The Potter heir had said that himself and there had been no deception in his words. Harry knew that now; the way to beat Charlus was by using more intricate tactics in the hope of catching him off guard.

A bolt of red energy shot from Harry's wand. Charlus swore and lowered his shield, recasting it so it might hold against the oncoming Blasting Curse. The spell struck not at Charlus, but at the floor some ten feet in front of him. The stones of their dungeon classroom broke apart and as they did, Harry's wand was already swishing and flicking. The stones rose into the air and soared towards the seemingly taken-aback sixth year, who lowered his shield and countered with a Blasting Curse of his own --- his non-verbal.

Harry had expected that, so with another flick of his wand, the debris twisted, elongated, and sprouted oddly-shaped protrusions that solidified into sets of ebony wings. The fully formed flock of sharp-taloned birds dove towards Charlus, who swore.

Harry took the opening to bombard the sixth year as he moved his wand in an effort to vanish the birds. One of them raked its talons across the back of his neck, causing Charlus's focus to waver as he hastily batted aside one of Harry's spells and returned fire. This let more of the birds get close to him and begin pecking at his skin. Charlus grunted and staggered into the wall of wings and feathers, stumbling over himself for a moment before something took him in the chest and knocked him off his feet. His wand left his grasp and his eyes widened at the sight of a black cloud bearing down on him, but the birds vanished before they could attack.

Harry was whooping on the other side of the room. His grin must have been something to behold, even he could tell it was unnaturally wide. Harry couldn't remember the last time he had smiled like this and a bout of joyful laughter came from him as he reached up and caught Charlus's wand.

"Bloody hell," Charlus muttered, climbing to his feet, "I underestimated you."

"You thought the stones were just a distraction so that I could take you down with curses."

He nodded. "What I didn't bloody realize was that they were just a setup. You knew I'd blast them, didn't you?"

Harry shrugged. "I couldn't know, but I guessed. You use blunt force a lot when dealing with stuff I conjure or transfigure. It seemed like a safe bet."

"Well, it worked," Charlus said with a scowl. "I should have used fire on those birds. I still could have won if I had."

Harry frowned. "I hadn't actually considered you might use fire against them. That would have ruined my plans, yeah."

"Then you would have been stuck dealing with a fire wall whilst I cast curses at you."

Harry nodded. "When I first started duelling, I thought it was just about who knew more spells. I figured out pretty quick there was more to it than that, but Merlin, it gets technical when two people are fairly matched."

"You should see some of the professional duels," Charlus said with a smirk. "If you think this is bad, they'd probably make your head explode. Some of those go for hours."

"Hours?" Harry asked, incredulous.

"Well, not often, but it does happen. Every now and then, two people will just be so evenly matched that they'll pretty much just go until one of them makes a mistake. Those duels can get ridiculously complicated, especially if the two of them have duelled enough to know each others' styles."

Harry loved duelling, but that sounded entirely too complicated to hold his attention. That was one of the things he loved most about Quidditch despite the fact he'd had little time for the game here: the rules were simple and it was easy to follow. Someone could learn the basics of Quidditch within a couple of days. Duelling was much more complicated. Harry had been at it for months and still, he felt like his journey had only barely begun.

Still, he had just beaten Charlus.

"How many people in the school do you think could beat you?" Harry asked, eyeing his would-be grandfather carefully.

Charlus screwed up his face in thought. "I don't know. Arcturus, maybe. I've never seen him fight, but the Blacks are known for having some nasty magic. I'd probably trounce him in a duel, but in a full-blown fight when he could throw around some of the darker stuff he probably knows, I don't know."

Just that name brought Harry's mind back to darker things. Things that he suspected lurked in shadow but had not yet managed to glimpse. Things that troubled his mind but evaded his eyes. A worrying theory, but not one he could prove and not one he wished to put forth unjustly.

Just thinking about the theory called forth a sense of gloom that Harry had only recently shaken off. He tried to fight it, but it weighed on him so heavily now that his mental walls began buckling and before he knew it, he was remembering Dorea's sharp words and the sound of her footsteps leaving the classroom.

Both of those memories stabbed at Harry's chest, but his suspicion was somehow worse. It twisted at his stomach and made him sick in ways nothing he'd lived through during his time quite matched. The image of a grief-stricken girl huddling against her older sister's words, its implications, and the horrible abuse of power encouraged by the very system that governed their world.

Surely Arcturus wouldn't...

Harry mentally grimaced and forced his mind away from such things. If the Black heir had acted, he did so with reasonable intentions. Besides, his actions didn't mean Harry had lost everything. His friendship with Dorea was not over, just on pause, and not all his closest friends had left him. Charlus was evidence of that, as was Elena, whose boldness had struck Harry soon after his fracture with Dorea.

***Eight days ago...***

Harry had been dreading this moment ever since Dorea cornered him and told him that she would be stepping away. That was a blow Harry had not yet recovered from. He had known few friends in his life and to have one of them so suddenly walk away from him hurt more than anything. Ever since, he had been wondering whether his slowly growing theory was rooted in logic or his own selfish desire to have not truly been betrayed. He had yet to decide, which was one of the many reasons he had not yet acted.

Now, here he was again, alone in an abandoned classroom with one of the two true friends he had left. She seemed less bold than Dorea had been, though brave in her own way. Harry could see it in her eyes, see the way Elena was building herself up to say something that was difficult for her. The blow was coming, a blow that would drive Harry to his knees, tear the air from his lungs, and leave him broken perhaps beyond repair. If one of them turning away had damaged him so grievously, he feared to imagine what would happen when Elena said what must come next.

"I've decided," she said, somewhat shakily.

Harry nodded. He tried to speak the words he'd thought of many times, but they wouldn't come. They were like chalk; any time they rose to his lips, his mouth felt too dry to speak. "I get it," he said at last, opting for an abridged version of what he'd had planned.

Elena blinked, then frowned. She was looking at him strangely, almost as though he had said something she had not planned for. Harry looked back at her, just as perplexed. Had she put such little thought into the inevitable conversation? Merlin, that somehow made it even worse. Harry could not have imagined a moment ago any way this could become more painful.

"You think I'm going to do what Dorea did, don't you?"

Harry opened his mouth to answer, but then hesitated. Was that... hurt in her voice? Yes, he had learned to read Elena in the months they had been friends and he thought it was. But why...

Then, it clicked, and Harry's mouth fell open, eyes going wide. "You're not going to?" he asked, suddenly breathless. Elena shook her head.

Harry's heart did a good job at trying to leap upwards into his throat, but he forced it back down. She still wanted to talk to him alone. Life had a funny way of showing him hope, then pulling it away. There would be no celebrating until he knew what Elena had to say, no matter how joyous those words made him feel.

"What is it then?" he asked, bracing himself for some unknown storm.

"I'm not going to stop hanging around with Riddle's group."

Of all the things Elena could have said, this was never what Harry would have imagined. He had told Elena of Riddle's offer for her and Dorea to cease spending time with her group the day after Riddle had made the offer. Harry had told her to pass it along to Dorea, but he had heard no word back. He'd hoped briefly that it would bring Dorea back to him, even if they wouldn't be able to spend as much time together as he would like. Elena, though... Harry had thought for sure she would take Riddle up on that offer.

"Why not?" he asked, unable to help himself. "You're terrified of Riddle, you always have been. And now that she's... you know, a Parselmouth..."

A visible shiver ran up Elena's spine, but she met Harry's eyes despite it. "I would hardly be able to speak with you."

Never had a single sentence made him so feel warm and alive. Merlin, if Dorea's words from days ago had been darkness closing in around him, Elena's were a hundred blazing lights poised and ready to drive that darkness away.

"You know you'll have to deal with Riddle, right?" Harry asked quietly. "I doubt I'll be rid of her any time soon and now that she's revealed herself as a Parselmouth, I have no idea how often she'll be toying with snakes."

Elena took a deep, shuddering breath, but nodded. "To hell with Riddle," she said fiercely, an uncharacteristic boldness shining in her eyes. "You're my best friend, Harry, and the only one I have. I'll deal with her if it means I get to keep that."

Harry beamed.

***Back in the present...***

The memory of Elena's words and the look in her eyes filled him with warmth even now and slowly, the dark veil of gloom pulled back and allowed Harry to think more clearly again.

"Anyone else?" he asked, following the previous line of questioning to keep his mind occupied.

"Everyone says Riddle's brilliant," Charlus said with a frown. "I find it hard to imagine I'd get beat by a fifth year, but after tonight, I guess people might have a point."

Harry winced, suddenly torn between two ways in which he could support Charlus. Had their duel wounded his confidence? They had duelled a handful of times tonight and Harry had only won once. It was a feat he doubted would repeat itself for some time, so why did Charlus seem bothered? Had his confidence been shaken?

Then, Harry remembered. His father was off fighting in the war against Grindelwald and Charlus meant to join up when his Hogwarts tenure ended. That explained it. However talented Harry was, Charlus must not have imagined he was on the level of some of Grindelwald's soldiers. He was probably second-guessing some of his long-term goals. Harry could sympathize with that; he had been there many times in his pursuit of Voldemort.

He had considered explaining to Charlus exactly how talented Riddle was after how confident the boy had appeared when discussing her a few weeks ago, but now Harry decided against it. That could happen another time when Charlus was prouder of his own ability. Harry suspected him capable of beating many of Grindelwald's soldiers.

Harry had a split-second of hesitation before he decided to be bold; probably bolder than he had been since being thrown back into the past. "I've duelled some of Grindelwald's men."

Charlus's head snapped up. "You what?"

Harry winced. "Well, uh... duelling might not be the right word. I kind of just got my arse handed to me, but at the time, I had no idea what I was doing."

"Define no idea what you were doing?"

"Absolutely none. I knew a couple of basic defensive spells and that was about it."

"How long ago was this?"

"During the summer."

"Oh, come off it. I appreciate you trying to boost my confidence, Harry, but there's no need to take the piss."

Harry blinked. "What?"

Charlus studied him closely, then paled. "Merlin," he breathed, "you're serious, aren't you?" Harry nodded and Charlus slumped back against the wall, suddenly looking like the strain of their duels had struck him all at once.

"Course I am," Harry answered, scratching an itch on his back with a confused hand. "Why wouldn't I be?"

"How the hell have you gotten so good so fast?"

Harry was taken aback by the question. He made to answer, but faltered. Merlin, it was startling when thinking of it that way, wasn't it? Back in the summer, he had scarcely known a handful of defensive spells. Now, he was on his way to becoming a master of Transfiguration and was already one of the best duellists in the school. What made the whole thing crazier was that his growth seemed exponential. Harry could hardly imagine where he might be in six months, let alone a year.

"I don't know," he answered honestly. "I've just spent a lot of time on everything, plus I've had help from people like Dumbledore---"

"Dumbledore's helped you?" Charlus asked, wide-eyed.

"Yeah, he gave me some pointers in Transfiguration early in the year that helped me out. They changed the way I cast magic. He's tutoring me in the it now, but he's not all. There have been... others."

Harry was taking a leap of faith in telling Charlus about the confrontation in Diagon Alley, but it was a leap he was reluctantly confident in. Telling him about Cerastes and the Chamber of Secrets? Now that would be a more treacherous jump that Harry doubted the result of. Some things were better left unsaid. In his own time, he had resented people like Dumbledore for holding secrets from him. The more time he spent in this era, the more he thought he understood the Dumbledore he'd once known.

Charlus just shook his head. "You have no idea how incredible this all is, do you?"

"I think I'm starting to get one," Harry admitted, toying sheepishly with a few stray locks of raven hair. "I just hadn't really thought about it."

"The teachers at Ilvermorny must be awful to have wasted a talent like you," Charlus said with a shake of his head. Harry smiled and Charlus's eyes refocused. "Right, you said you fought some of Grindelwald's men?"

"Got trounced by them more like, but again, I was an idiot."

"Same difference," Charlus said with a wave of his hand.

"Not really, but yeah, I was there."

"What were they like?" Charlus asked, eyes alight. "How did they fight?"

"Honestly," Harry said, preparing to tell the tale in full for the first time since that fateful afternoon with Slughorn, "after watching you duel, they don't impress me."

And so, the tale began.

***February 28, 1943***

***The Great Hall***

***7:14 PM***

Harry had hoped to sneak down to the Chamber of Secrets today, but as of yet, that had not been possible. Much of his day had been spent in the company of Riddle and her posse, and the rest had been spent alone with Elena. Any time the two of them were together, Harry still felt Dorea's absence. It hung over him like a dark storm cloud, rumbling especially loud whenever he had forgotten. Elena's presence kept it away, but barely. Harry wondered what would cease first: the feelings of missing Dorea, or the way Elena drove those feelings away just by being near him. He hoped, for his sake, that it was the former.

The day had been dazzlingly bright and remarkably warm for the end of February. There had been a soft breeze touched by the scent of spring, bringing with it the promise that the cold, desolate season would soon give way to something altogether more pleasant. Without Quidditch, Harry had cared less about the weather than ever before until about a month ago. That was when Charlus had convinced him to take up running, of all things, and now there was no one more excited for the warmer temperatures than him.

Charlus was another person Harry had been thinking about often lately. Not only about their most recent round of duels and the secrets Harry had divulged, but about other possibilities.

The longer their friendship stretched on, the more Harry considered introducing him to Elena. The problem was Riddle. Harry had no idea how she would react to the information that one of Harry's best friends was Charlus Potter. It wasn't that he thought Elena would tell, it was that he doubted she was subtle enough to pull it off. Harry moving freely through the castle on his own and vanishing for hours at a time was one thing. It became more suspicious if it was two of them and Harry suspected that, at the very least, Riddle would fear they were planning something.

He supposed that, in this way, it might have been better if Elena had accepted the offer to part from Riddle's group, but Harry would not have traded her continued presence for the world. There would be time for all of his friends to meet in the future. For now, he would just have to enjoy them separately. Yet another reason to decide exactly how to proceed with Riddle and what to do if things surrounding her.

Harry let his eyes rest on Riddle, who was currently engaged in a conversation with Felix Rosier. Her mouth was just parting to say something when all the sounds in the hall were drowned out by a horrible scream, followed by complete and total silence.

The crowd remained perfectly still for about three seconds before students were on their feet and surging towards the doors. Harry was one of the first to move, impossible thoughts racing through his mind. No, it couldn't be --- not after all he had done to prevent it.

Finding the source of the scream had proven less than difficult. It had come from near the mouth of the Great Hall itself and there, strewn across the floor, was a body Harry recognized as Myrtle Warren's.

There was no thought in his decision to begin pushing through the crowd. He hardly noticed he was doing it at all until he stood over her body. A glance over his shoulder revealed that both Dumbledore and Riddle's posse were hot on his heels, so Harry took the opportunity to crouch and examine her more closely, hoping beyond hope that history had not repeated itself.

A sigh of relief escaped him when he pressed his fingers to her neck and felt a steady pulse. It was a touch slower than Harry thought was healthy, but it was there. He lifted his eyes and let them roam over the rest of her. His initial examination caused dread to rise like bile from the pit of his stomach, searing his throat and choking the life from his lungs.

Harry took a deep breath and pulled on the Occlumency exercises from Riddle's journal. His mind slowly returned to him, but the panic still thundered in his ears with every beat of his chest.

Strong hands grabbed his shoulders and Harry spun, poised to bring his elbow up.

"Stand back please, Harry, I would like to have a look at her."

It was Dumbledore who spoke, eyes dark and expression troubled. Harry reluctantly stepped back and faded into the circle of Riddle and her friends.

"Anything of note?" she whispered. Harry looked up at her and blanched. Merlin, that look in her eyes --- it was almost identical to the one she'd worn before attacking Abraxas Malfoy and subjugating the rest of Slytherin House.

He shook his head. He had no information to share and even if he did, none of it would be passed along to her.

"What does it mean?" Harry heard a younger student ask from nearby. Harry frowned. What did what mean? He was the only one who knew this may have any meaning at all, right?

Harry turned his eyes back to the scene and saw it for the first time. He had been so transfixed by Myrtle that he had missed the writing on the wall --- done in a hauntingly familiar script of red letters that dripped at the edges. Wait... no, that was different. Any time a message had been left in his time, it *looked like* the attacker had written in blood. This time, there was no mistaking it --- the attacker had absolutely written in blood; though the message was indeed hauntingly familiar.

*Enemies of the heir, beware.*

**Chapter 25: The Plot Thickens**

***March 13, 1943***

***The Chamber of Secrets***

***9:56 PM***

It had been two weeks since the attack on Myrtle Warren, and the castle was still in disarray. The whispers had been constant, the school abuzz like a thousand raging bees. The students spent the rest of that first day locked down and, for the next week, a teacher had been assigned to stand at the door of the Great Hall during all meals and gatherings. The patrols had been almost doubled through the halls, something that Harry loathed. It made slipping out of the common room or sneaking around at night much more difficult. Not for the first time, he wished more than anything he had possessed the foresight to carry his invisibility cloak when the time turner threw him back into the past.

All the students had waited eagerly for the diagnosis on Myrtle, Harry most of all. Dumbledore had been confused at the scene of the crime just like he had been during Harry's second year. It had been a bad omen.

Myrtle was alive, but completely unresponsive. The rumours said she was paralyzed or --- to use a different term Harry had heard thrown around --- petrified.

Most of the student body had been speculating as to what kind of magic was even capable of such a thing, at least when they weren't busy trying to piece together exactly who the culprit was. Even Riddle and her group of friends were not untouched by such speculation.

***Thirteen days ago...***

Harry sensed unrest in Riddle from the moment Myrtle's body was found. What did it mean? Surely she was the Heir of Slytherin. That was the only thing that made sense, but... did it? How had she gained access to the Chamber of Secrets? Surely this was much too coincidental to be the work of anything other than Cerastes, but that too had its problems.

Cerastes did not strike Harry as a good actor. Snakes had little use for such talents, and the basilisk had always been blunt.

It just didn\'t make sense. Harry had resolved to watch Riddle even more closely in the coming days and weeks, but he feared it would be for naught. Emily Riddle had an astounding talent for making things even more confusing and Harry somehow suspected that would be the case yet again, though he could not imagine how things could grow more complex than they already were.

He had been able to glean little of her mood beyond the restlessness. She made no attempt to hide it, instead pacing often in the common room, which they had been confined to whilst the teachers searched the school.

That search took the rest of the day and bled into the next, but at long last, the lockdown was lifted. Riddle looked more pleased to leave than anyone. Harry could not blame her. If she was the attacker, she had likely been wracked with nerves, worried that someone on the staff would discover a piece of evidence. Even if she hadn't, the whole of Slytherin House was sure she was the culprit. The whispers were practically deafening all throughout the common room and though Riddle had paid them no visible heed, Harry knew she heard them.

Classes went as per usual that first day out of the common room, but the tension was unlike anything Harry had ever seen. In his own time, students had at least been somewhat accustomed to oddities at Hogwarts; what with the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor changing every year, a troll in the dungeons, and a cursed bludger all being fresh in everyone's memories. This student body was not nearly as conditioned to expect things out of the ordinary and they were all on edge with the war heating up on the continent and Grindelwald's forces having been especially vicious since their defeat at Stalingrad.

Harry marvelled at Riddle's control all throughout dinner. Everyone in the group knew that a meeting would soon come, yet she showed no indication. There was no haste in her movements, no tension in her muscles, no lack of grace in her posture or manners. Harry had never met anyone her age with such composure. This was what a Slytherin was supposed to be. The snakes of his time were pathetic compared to this. Someone like Draco Malfoy could never have made this act work.

Now that Harry thought about it, it wasn't just Riddle. The collective IQ of Slytherin House seemed higher in these times. It made some sense. Many of these childrens' parents had lived through the Great War and now, their children were living through another. That had to breed a certain kind of person, especially when that was mixed with the harsher traditions and more strictly-enforced etiquette of this age.

Despite her composure, Riddle practically demanded all of them finish quickly once she had. She said nothing, but her stares made her wishes clear. When they had all pushed their plates away, she led them from the hall and Harry quickly realized one of the few good things about Riddle revealing herself as a Parselmouth --- there were an astonishing number of secret passages that were triggered by speaking Salazar's sacred tongue.

Harry frowned as they moved through a dark, winding passage sloping steadily upwards. He remembered none of these being on the Marauder's Map. It made some sense --- the Marauders had never discovered the Chamber of Secrets and none of them were Parselmouths --- but it still worried him.

Along with the chamber and the Room of Requirement, this was now the third time Riddle had shown off knowledge of the castle greater than even the Marauders. It was just one more advantage she held over Harry and, in that moment, he realized becoming magically powerful might not be enough. He resolved to make more night time excursions around the castle and discover more for himself. Now that she may really be the Heir of Slytherin despite his intervention, Harry feared he would need every available advantage.

They reached the secret room on the third floor faster than they ever had before. Riddle really was fond of this room. Harry suspected she preferred the Room of Requirement, but that was clearly not a secret she was willing to share with her lackeys. Why she had decided to offer it to Harry in the first place still baffled him. It was an invaluable study guide and an excellent place for practicing magic. Throwing something like that away so casually just for the opportunity to befriend Harry still seemed odd. Riddle always seemed to act pragmatically and with her goals in mind, but Harry still failed to see what that agreement had accomplished. Merlin, he was sick of being perplexed by Riddle.

Apparently, so were the others, for they all watched Riddle expectantly. Harry wondered why for a moment, then it hit him --- they were all hoping she would reveal herself as the Heir of Slytherin. He wanted to believe they only wished to hear so because it would dissuade their worries, but he knew that was untrue. Members like Lestrange, Rosier, and Dolohov would probably hail this attacker as a saviour so long as they continued attacking only muggleborns. The thought made Harry sick.

Riddle just watched all of them, waiting for someone to speak. Harry realized what she was doing. She was curious, testing them to see who would ask first. It would show her who was the boldest or, perhaps, who was the most impatient. It was another sign of how far he had come. Back in his own time, he would never have recognized a social trap like this one, but here, he had picked up on it in seconds.

Mulciber, apparently, did not. "So..." he asked, letting his question hang in the air.

Riddle just raised an eyebrow. "So what, exactly, Silas?"

"Well," he said, beginning to shuffle, "it was you, wasn't it? You attacked Myrtle?"

Riddle scowled. "Are you that imperceptive, Silas?"

"Imperceptive?"

"I have treated Myrtle well and suffered her all year. I have shown her nothing but kindness and patience even in the face of Abraxas and his threats. Why would I suddenly shift my stance and attack her?"

Mulciber looked stumped, but Rosier was not. Now that one of them had spoken, it appeared that the flood gates had opened. "It would be a sound diversion. Everyone would say the same thing you're saying now. They would all remember you being patient and kind when it was all just a setup."

"A setup for what, exactly?" Riddle asked, eyes now fixed firmly on Rosier.

He held her gaze much more effectively than Mulciber. "To begin purging the school of muggleborns as the myth says. Slytherin's heir was supposed to open the Chamber of Secrets. There's only one person at Hogwarts I know who can speak Parseltongue."

There was a general din of agreement all around the circle, but Riddle's posture remained unchanged. "Why would I have any interest in purging the school of muggleborns? Need I remind you I am not pure of blood myself?"

Rosier's expression darkened before his cheeks flushed. Harry became intrigued. Never before had this group discussed Riddle's blood status so openly. Now it was clear they really did just do their best to ignore it. It must have been an uncomfortable truth for these students to know that the one they were following so completely was technically a rank below them.

"You can't play innocent with us," pressed Lestrange. "Any time you speak of the muggles, you sound just like us. You know they're a stain on this world."

"The muggles have no bearing in this conversation."

"But---"

"Magic is magic, Romulus. Would you deny I am more skillful than any other student you have ever seen?" No one did. "I am a halfblood." Riddle turned her attention towards Harry for the first time. "Harry is a fourth year and he duelled Antonin to a stalemate despite his practice. He is also the fastest improving member of this group. As I'm sure you're all aware, he too is a halfblood."

"What's your point?" Rosier asked with narrowed eyes, looking recovered from his earlier break in composure.

"My point is that there is very little differentiating muggleborns from purebloods, no matter what you have been taught. What is important is the difference between muggles and magicians. If I could shatter the connection between our two worlds with a snap of my fingers, I would."

"But muggleborns are a link," argued Lestrange, "they try and impose their traditions upon us."

Riddle waved a hand. "They will never have true success doing so. Let them try, let them fail, it matters very little to me. The important connections between the worlds cannot be shattered by purging Hogwarts of its muggleborns. That would not stop the muggle weapons killing witches and wizards, it would not stop the abuse of magical children, and it would not destroy the risk muggles pose. I gain nothing from purging the school of muggleborns, so I will tell you all now that I am not the Heir of Slytherin."

Harry watched Riddle's face for any signs of insincerity, but he could find none, but that couldn't be right. Despite the problems with the theory, Riddle being the Heir of Slytherin and attacking with Cerastes was the only thing that made sense. Surely no one else could be capable of a feat so similar to the attacks Harry remembered. It was all too convenient.

Yet Riddle's logic was iron-clad. She was a halfblood who despised muggles. She made no illusions about that. She spoke candidly about the vitriol and even outlined some of the reasons why it existed. This had always been something that puzzled Harry about Voldemort. Why had he risen against muggleborns? It had never made any sense to him. Perhaps that was why Riddle's arguments were swaying him. Was Harry trying to use irrelevant foresight and justifying her deception?

He frowned. If Riddle was the Heir of Slytherin, she was not only lying to him, but to all of her lackeys. It was not a lie they liked, either. Harry could see the tension in all of them and knew instinctively that Riddle had said something foolish. She had to know that, yet she had said it anyway. She had no reasons to lie about this sort of thing to these people. Perhaps she only did it because Harry was there, but even that felt flimsy. Why go through the effort? She knew how much he liked wandering off --- she could easily have allowed him to do that at any time. That way she could have held this meeting without him and spoken openly.

Damnit! Harry had jinxed himself. He had thought just minutes ago this whole thing was about as complex as it could get, but his cynical side had been right --- Riddle really had found a way to make things even more complicated.

***Back in the present...***

Almost two weeks had passed since that meeting and Harry still had yet to make heads or tails of anything. It was all such a convoluted mess. There was contradicting evidence everywhere and Harry was unsure what to discard and what to believe. It was like working his way through a house of mirrors but instead of bumping his head against glass, his missteps had the possibility of sending him and the magical world plummeting into a void of destruction and despair.

How he yearned to just question Cerastes. Harry'd had much time to think, since slipping away these past two weeks had been next to impossible. There had been a time when he had genuinely considered demanding Cerastes to answer him. His logic had been sound. Everything he knew indicated the basilisk was completely subject to the whims of whomever its master was. Cerastes had served faithfully all year and, as far as the snake knew, Harry was its master.

But that was where that plan crumbled. If Riddle had somehow gained access to the Chamber of Secrets, Cerastes may now know the truth about him and the falsehoods he'd maintained. The basilisk would now obey Riddle, which meant it was unlikely to answer any of Harry's questions. He was wary of going back to the Chamber of Secrets at all, but he had forced himself to descend. His instincts said Cerastes was fond of him. He doubted the basilisk would hurt him even if it sided with Riddle. Not unless she explicitly told it to, but if Riddle wanted Harry dead, she could have killed him herself.

**"It has been longer this time than any other,"** Cerastes hissed when Harry entered the chamber.

**"There was an incident not long ago that forced the school into chaos. It made slipping away from the usurper difficult."**

Merlin, he really hoped Cerastes was on his side. He trusted the snake, but how could he read someone or something he couldn't even look at? That would probably make it laughably easy for the basilisk to deceive him.

**"Anything troubling?"**

**"Yes, but the chaos I was talking about isn't as worrying."** That was, of course, a lie, but Harry would not be speaking about that particular event and his suspicions surrounding it. **"One of my best friends hasn't spoken to me in weeks, all because the usurper revealed her power and now my friend is afraid of being near her."**

**"Then your friend is a coward who never deserved your fondness."**

Harry grimaced. **"I'll be the judge of that, thank you."**

**"Of course, master. I was only advising. I will believe as you do if you command it."**

**"Believe as you like, but I'd like any advice to be about how I can repair the relationship."**

**"Snakes are not good at these sorts of things. Relationships mean little to us."**

**"That wasn't what I meant, I knew you wouldn't be of any use there."**

**"Then what was it you wanted?"**

**"To give you the details and tell you of my suspicions. People may be beyond you, but you have always read situations well. I want a second opinion."**

Cerastes's next hiss sounded almost excited. Damn basilisks and their lack of empathy --- he had ignored Harry's distress entirely in favour of revelling in the praise.

***March 19, 1943***

***Albus Dumbledore's Office***

***9:12 PM***

Friday evenings were both extremely busy and extremely stressful. Harry usually went from dinner back to the common room, where he would hastily try and finish as much of the weekend homework as he possibly could. He would then make his way up towards Dumbledore's office for their weekly Transfiguration lesson before finally meeting up with Riddle to discuss Ancient Runes.

Despite the stress and tight schedule, Harry enjoyed this part of his Fridays. Every time he finished another one-on-one lesson with Dumbledore, his confidence soared. Transfiguration continued to come easily to him. He had long ago managed some small feats with human Transfiguration and was now working on larger, more significant transformations.

Tonight, Harry had transformed his legs into a pair of flippers. This had taken him two lessons to finish, but Dumbledore beamed and Harry felt pride so strong it had only ever been rivalled once before --- that being when he had beaten Charlus for the first time and watched the older boy's wand soar towards him.

"This is truly exceptional," Dumbledore said, reverting Harry's body back to normal with a wave of his wand. "We may need to reconsider our goals for this year."

"Reconsider, Professor?"

"I suspect that by the year's end, you will have reached the level I would expect of any NEWT-level student. I think we may even be able to push further."

Harry bit his lip as he thought, wondering how perceptive or suspicious Dumbledore could possibly be. Did he dare ask this? Did it show his hand too directly? It probably did, but at this stage, Harry felt as though his options were scarce. He really did need every advantage he could get.

"Is something troubling you, Harry?" Dumbledore asked. "Some adverse effect of the transformation, perhaps?"

Harry shook his head. "No, sir, I was just thinking." He hesitated. "Professor, with the war going on and the attacks inside the castle, do you think it would be possible for anything after the curriculum to focus on combat? Like, how Transfiguration could be used in a duel?"

Dumbledore took a step back and studied him. "There has only been one attack in the castle thus far. That is discounting the unfortunate accident involving the acromantula, but I suspect it is unrelated to our current plight."

Harry agreed. Hagrid had likely just lost control of Aragog and neither of them was capable of what had befallen Myrtle Warren. It had now been almost three weeks and she remained unmoving in the hospital wing, with the professors and the matron all thoroughly baffled.

"Yes, sir, but most people think there will be more." Harry watched his face closely. "I think you believe that, too."

Dumbledore sighed and sat back in his chair. "I would like to believe otherwise. There is enough conflict in the world right now without it touching a school."

"But you can't deny it?"

Dumbledore seemed to consider something. "The attack was very reminiscent of a legend that has floated around for some time."

"The Chamber of Secrets --- enemies of the heir could refer to the Heir of Slytherin."

"Indeed," Dumbledore said, raising an eyebrow. "May I ask how you came across this particular tale?"

"I read a bunch about Hogwarts before coming here, just so I wasn't shell shocked. *Hogwarts, A History* talks a little bit about the Chamber of Secrets." Despite Harry's new academic focus, that was one book he had still yet to read. Hermione had, though, and Harry remembered her telling him and Ron about what that book said regarding the Chamber of Secrets.

Merlin, that was odd. Thoughts of Hermione and Ron had once torn Harry apart, but now? He missed them, but it was a dull, aching pain. It persisted even as he continued to speak, but it was lost in the background and quickly faded away to nothing at all. That made a part of Harry very sad, but most of him was grateful such thoughts would not damage him the way they once had.

Dumbledore nodded. "I suppose it would, yes."

"So you think the person attacking students is the Heir of Slytherin."

"I think it's a possibility that cannot be discounted."

Harry had to remember that, in this time, Dumbledore was still only the Transfiguration Professor. He might have generally been more open, but discussing something like this was above his station. Harry imagined he could get in grievous trouble if he told him too much, so he allowed the conversation to move on as his mind moved on to other problems.

***March 25, 1943***

***The Restricted Section***

***10:24 PM***

The common room had already begun emptying by the time Harry slipped out. Riddle was on prefect patrol duty and many of the other Slytherins were either sleeping or studying. Spring break was fast-approaching and with it would come their final set of major tests prior to the end-of-year exams. This was the second most important time of the year in terms of their grades, so the castle felt quieter now than ever.

Harry had watched Riddle's group closely for months and, by now, gained a relative understanding of how most of its members spent their time. Whilst the likes of Lestrange and Rosier might well be in bed on nights when Riddle was absent, Cassiopeia most certainly would not be. She was like Riddle in that way. Oftentimes, no one would even see her retreat to the dorms. She would just be there the next morning.

Finding her almost half an hour after curfew was not something Harry looked forward to, but it was necessary. If he was right about the entire situation with Dorea, this was the only first step. Even Cerastes had agreed with his read on the situation and had helped him devise the only plan either could think of.

Harry neared the library's door and paused, glancing down the corridor before removing his wand. This was going to be a true test of how far he had come in other subjects, not just Transfiguration. He had been trying to make this spell work for some time, but it had always proven difficult. Tonight, it had to work.

"Illūsiōnum."

Harry felt no physical change, but he knew at once the magic had taken effect. Merlin, magic sensing had become surprisingly useful. He cast a Supersensory Charm on himself so he could listen to whatever was happening inside the library. No one appeared to be near the door, so he cancelled that spell, cast a Silencing Charm on the door's hinges, and stepped inside.

Many of the candles and torches had been extinguished with the passing of curfew, so the library was plunged mostly into darkness. It was so complete near the door that Harry mentally cursed before recasting the Supersensory Charm simply so he could see where he was going.

He crept towards the Restricted Section, where he heard someone breathing. As he drew near, he held up his pass from Slughorn and walked straight through. The librarian may not have been here, but there were wards guarding the section's entrance. If he went through all this trouble just to find another student sitting where he presumed Cassie to be, he would be livid.

"You can reveal yourself," she said as he drew near. "I know you're there."

Harry had felt the ward coming, but had detected no ill intent. He had decided it was likely just there to alert Cassie if someone drew near. Disillusionment Charms did not fool something like that, but they didn't need to. Harry was not here to hide.

He let his spell fall and stepped towards her. For a moment, she actually looked surprised. "Pavonis?"

"Black."

"I wouldn't have expected it to be you."

"I would have been surprised if you had. I wouldn't have expected me to be sneaking up on you, either, but here we are."

"You want something then?"

"I have a small favour to ask."

Cassiopeia raised an eyebrow. "A favour? I wasn't aware we were at the stage of asking favours from each other."

"I do mean small." Harry reached into the pocket of his robes and withdrew a simple envelope, holding it out. "I wanted to ask if you could deliver this message to Arcturus Black."

**Author's Endnote:**

**A number of reviews have voiced displeasure about how long it's taking Harry to realize Riddle is not the same person he knew in his time. I must admit this surprises me. He has known her for just over half a year. That time has to contend with three years of him hearing just how awful Voldemort was, not to mention the fact he murdered Harry's parents and confined him to a childhood he loathed.**

**The shift will happen, but if you expect all of that to be undone by a single event, you are reading the wrong story. The time is coming, but it has not arrived yet. I want character development to feel earned, not just to happen because it's convenient for the plot.**

**I absolutely respect different opinions, but thought I would just give mine here. It sounded much more efficient than individually responding to everyone sharing similar thoughts.**

**I do appreciate the reviews, though, both positive and negative. Keep those coming because there have absolutely been some whose contents have been helpful.**

**Like I said in the opening AN, I will be recording a podcast with the author of *A Cadmean Victory*. If you want to ask us any questions, submit them on my Discord server, in a review of this chapter, or in a PM.**

**Chapter 26: Dread on the Wind**

***April 3, 1943***

***Hogsmeade***

***10:58 AM***

Spring had arrived in the Scottish highlands. The wind was milder, the air warmer, the ground no longer covered in snow. It was instead damp from the season's rain and coated in a thick layer of mud that pulled at the feet of the students moving through the bustling town of Hogsmeade.

"I was excited for this trip," Marianna grumbled, looking up towards the rain-filled sky. Raindrops pounded against the carriage's roof as they neared the village, sounding like a hundred frantic knocks upon an old oak door.

"It's just water," Lestrange scoffed. "It isn't like it's made from poison." The look on Marianna's face suggested she thought otherwise, though she argued no longer --- probably because the carriage had come to a stop and they were all filing out one after the other.

Harry thought the girl might have a point as the mud squelched beneath his feet and rain wetted his hair. He pulled up the hood of his cloak, but he knew that before long it would be soaked through and weigh him down.

Thunder boomed somewhere off in the distance as the remaining members of their group exited the carriage. Harry found himself forcefully reminded of the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff near the beginning of his third year. It was a good thing there were no dementors this time around. He had realized not long ago that the thought of Ron and Hermione no longer sent him spiralling, but he still feared how he might react to the presence of dementors. He could fight them now --- that was not the problem --- but they would likely dredge up those memories in more chilling detail.

"Just be grateful we can be out here at all," said Rosier, the last to step down from the carriage.

"What do you mean? It's a basic right of Hogwarts students. It has been for centuries."

"The basic rights of Hogwarts students may change if Grindelwald targets England. The whispers are getting louder, you know."

"I've heard," Lestrange added. "Father says Grindelwald might try something this summer. Something more serious than his attack on Diagon."

"I'd wait too if I were him," Marianna grumbled, glaring one last time at the sky before their group began moving further into the village.

Harry wondered as they walked whether there was actual evidence to support Rosier's rumour or whether his father had just been blindly guessing. People had said for months that Grindelwald may attack England if his expedition failed in Russia. His forces had retreated almost three months ago, yet there had been no sign of them anywhere near English soil. Harry had begun believing many of the whispers, but now he was sceptical again. Grindelwald never attacked England in his own time and he was beginning to suspect that would not change now.

Marianna was doing her best to hide in her cloak before long and soon after, even Harry shivered. The cold vanished before his shudder finished, water suddenly rolling off his cloak and pooling at his feet.

"Nifty spell," said Rosier, nodding at Riddle, who just smiled. *It's like the spell Hermione used, but better.*

The spell extended their time outside once it had been cast on everyone, but they still did not linger long before ducking inside the Three Broomsticks.

The pub was full to bursting with Hogwarts students. Harry thought more of them would stay back at the castle, but he supposed with the Easter holidays coming fast, now was the last time to explore before the break.

*I'm sure having a psychopath romancing the school probably helped get people out of the castle, too.* It had been more than a month since the lone attack and the general buzz had died down, but the shadowy threat still hung high above them all. Some students whispered that the Heir would strike once again before the break, sending much of the population home with fear in their hearts.

Harry, for his part, had been no more successful in working through the complex web of contradictions surrounding Riddle and her possible involvement. Again, he longed for the invisibility cloak. It would have made following her much easier. She would still have access to the Homenum Revelio Charm, but he might still have gambled had he possessed the cloak.

The most he could do was let slip to the professors how effective Mandrake Draught would be in curing Myrtle of her plight. The draught was apparently more obscure in these times, being a relatively recent discovery. None of the professors had mentioned it, and though Harry had considered doing so, he could not decide how to proceed without looking suspicious.

The sound of drinks being placed on the table drove his more abstract thoughts away. The pub was so full that its bartender was in constant demand, so Riddle and Cassie had gone up to the bar and retrieved the group's drinks.

Cassie placed Harry's down in front of him, but Harry thought he saw something odd about the motion. His eyes narrowed as he reached for the bottle, spotting a slight protrusion underneath it. He paused and waited until the group was distracted before lifting the bottle and snatching the roll of parchment beneath. Only Cassie met his eyes, giving him a single nod before turning back to her conversation with Riddle.

***April 5, 1943***

***The Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom***

***1:10 PM***

Harry had once been very anxious about taking Defence Against the Dark Arts with the fifth years. Indeed, he'd had good reasons, but now, Harry found it the most pleasant of his classes. Not because of the students that were there, but because of the students who were not. Seeing Dorea was always painful. Harry had hoped after their schism that time would begin healing those wounds. Perhaps it still would, but if so, its process was slow and would come only after much pain.

The note Cassie slipped Harry turned out to be from Arcturus. Harry had seen the signature before reading the note and, for a moment, hope had welled up inside him. The actual contents were far from a death blow, but they were certainly not as promising as Harry might have hoped. Leave it up to a Black to respond in such vague terms. The bastard might as well have ignored him for all the good his reply did at clarifying things.

Today's double Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson was their duelling session for the month of April. Harry had duelled almost everyone in the class throughout the course of the year. The only students remaining were Cassie and Riddle. Last month, Harry had duelled Felix Rosier whilst Riddle had duelled Cassie. Cassie had lasted longer against Riddle than anyone else, but the duel had still not been competitive.

Harry had expected his own duel with Rosier to be a battle reminiscent of the one he'd had months ago with Dolohov, but he had been mistaken.

Rosier --- who was probably the fourth most dangerous duellist in his year after Riddle, Cassie, and Dolohov --- had posed Harry few problems at all. He was swift and precise with a keen mind for duelling. His mind was Rosier's greatest weapon --- his spell selection was textbook, his positioning perfect.

None of that had been enough. A pack of rabid dogs transfigured from Merrythought's desk Harry had transfigured Merrythought's desk caught him off guard, then there had been the floor, constantly shifting beneath his feet, snaking up in stony spires to entrap his legs.

There had been whispers after that duel. He recognized them as the same kinds of whispers that followed Riddle around the castle --- the same kinds of rumours that had followed him back when the school thought him the Heir of Slytherin.

Harry hated them once, but now, they excited him. There had been plenty of signs throughout the year marking his progress, but this one had a special sort of meaning to him. Others were taking notice, and not just those who spent the most time with him. It was better they feared him than looked down on him. If they compared him to Riddle, maybe it would give her pause in the future. Perhaps it even meant that Harry really was closing the gap fast enough and that, soon, he would be able to compete with her.

Today might well be the day Harry found out for himself. Riddle wondered about it, too; Harry could see it in her posture. She sat a notch stiffer than usual, though she did a good job of hiding it. Was she nervous? Did she wonder whether or not she could best him?

"Today will be the penultimate rounds of duelling," Merrythought told them immediately after taking the roll. "The entirety of June will be spent preparing for the O.W.L. exams."

Everyone in the room held their collective breath, waiting for the bracket to be read. It appeared Harry and Riddle were not the only ones tense with anticipation.

Merrythought smiled --- a rarity for her. "There are two undefeated students remaining, as you all seem to know. They will not duel today. That match is one I am selfishly saving for the finale. The two will duel at the end of class next month. Miss Riddle will duel Master Dolohov today, and Master Pavonis will duel Miss Black."

Cassiopeia Black --- this was going to be an interesting fight indeed. Harry used the word fight because, against Cassie, that was what it would be. She played dirty and was not afraid to use questionable magic if she thought herself able to get away with it. Harry knew from his past duel with Dolohov how easily that sort of behaviour could escalate things, so he mentally prepared himself for the worst.

Merlin, he had been so fixated on the prospect of duelling Riddle that he had spared Cassie no mind. She was plenty dangerous in her own right. If Harry was not careful, only Riddle would enter their clash unbeaten.

Cassie was the soundest duellist he'd yet faced. She was like a blend of Dolohov and Rosier --- offensively-minded, but with sharp fundamentals and much self-control. She would not let herself get out of position, but nor would she sit back and let him find his rhythm. There were no obvious weaknesses this time --- no easy path to victory.

*Merlin, she looks determined.* The first pair of students had started duelling and most were watching keenly as Rosier took out his frustration from last month's loss. Cassie just remained glaring at Harry, who felt another stare and turned to meet Riddle's eyes. She looked from him to Cassie with a contemplative expression and finally, Harry understood.

This was about impressing Riddle. Cassie remembered the praise Riddle had given Harry that first night after the Heir's attack and sought to steal Riddle's attention all away from him. She was the most loyal of them to Riddle and, at times, like her shadow. *That's an annoyingly powerful motivator; she's going to fight hard.*

The duels stretched on longer than ever before. This was relatively normal. Every session they had grew longer. Part of this was the general increase in skill level, but Harry suspected there was more at play. He remembered the way Charlus had spoken about professional duelling and how some contests could go on forever. He had said it had more to do with skill --- the more two people duelled, the closer they often became. His duels with Harry had proven as much; even though no one in the room had duelled the same combatant more than once, Harry knew all of them watched every duel carefully. They probably all had a feel for each other's style and had therefore begun planning for future opponents.

Dolohov did not seem to plan for anyone. He fought the same way regardless of the opponent. Even against Riddle, he did his best to blitz forward with a barrage of precise, offensive strikes. Riddle defended using mostly Transfiguration, widening the window for each counter and stripping Dolohov of his wand before long. It was less magically impressive than most of her previous duels, but the efficiency with which she took Dolohov apart was startling. She had decided to show a different facet of her game today. Harry realized after a moment that she had duelled much like him. Movement, transfiguration, diversion --- Riddle had played his game and won.

She smiled at him on the way back to her seat. That sealed it. She was trying to goad him into matching her style, which tended to be overwhelming opponents with elaborate magic they were unprepared for. Harry bit his lip. If Riddle wanted him to do it, it was probably a bad idea. That logic felt sound, but overwhelming Cassiopeia was exactly what he planned to do and Harry still had a Gryffindor streak a mile wide.

He pondered his approach even as he stood facing Cassie --- not until Merrythought called for the duel to commence did Harry decide to accept Riddle's challenge.

He dove to avoid an array of curses fired as soon as the duel began. Cassie had wasted no time and had attacked with a series of spells that could best be described as shady.

*Fine,* Harry thought, *no holding back then.*

The floor split at his feet, stones rising up to defend against her next barrage. This was something Dumbledore had shown him during their last lesson. The Transfiguration Professor had begun using combat-based teachings as incentives for Harry to complete tasks.

The stones perfectly intercepted Cassie's volley and with a wave of his wand, Harry sent them hurtling back towards her, morphing first into a flock of ravens, then into a halo of arrows. Cassie did not make the same mistake Charlus had months ago. She answered with a blazing stream of fire that choked the room with smoke and sent an unpleasant prickle of hair-searing heat up Harry's front as the flames drew near.

He let it come close, swishing his wand at the last possible second and taking control of the fire, moulding it into a flaming whip that he pulled back behind him, then lashed towards Cassiopeia, whose eyes had gone wide. It had been Charlus who taught him that overpowering someone's will and taking control of their creation was possible. He had done it to a flock of birds, sending them back towards Harry and following them with arrows. That had actually been where Harry got the idea to combine them.

Cassie made the mistake of diving to the side. Harry forced the whip to split with some difficulty, sending a tendril of fire back towards Cassie. She grunted with pain as one of her pant legs blazed.

Harry knew Merrythought would stop the duel any second if it continued, but he didn't plan for that to happen. The floor cracked again, but this time the stones wriggled around Cassie, trapping her arms and legs and effectively pinning her to the floor.

Harry stood in shock as the adrenaline began to ebb. Surely, there would be a lecture coming for escalating the duel, but he was beyond caring.

Had he just done that?

Some of that magic wasn't anything he had ever tried. Sure, he had known it was all possible, but to pull it off the way he had? Merlin, he really did have a gift for underestimating himself. Dumbledore might not have been directly teaching him much combat-based Transfiguration yet, but Harry was learning that most concepts could be extrapolated and used in situations outside their intended scope.

The class was completely silent, but Harry ignored all but one of them as his eyes searched for Riddle.

She was sitting at her desk with her hands folded, eyes unblinkingly watching him. He held her stare until she smiled lightly and dipped her head before turning her attention to the now irate Professor Merrythought.

Harry almost leapt for joy. Finally, he'd won a round.

***April 9, 1943***

***Horace Slughorn's Office***

***9:44 PM***

The school was abuzz with tales of Harry's performance before the day was at its end. The stories only grew wilder as the hours bled into days. Harry had even heard some first year whispering about how he had conjured a battalion of flaming warriors to do his bidding when he passed by. He thought that sounded like a good idea, though it was miles beyond his capabilities right now. The flaming whip had been difficult, and he had almost lost control when sending an individual tendril towards Cassie who, for her part, had been surprisingly pleasant with Harry following the duel.

Others in the group had begun treating him somewhat differently. Mulciber had almost stopped scowling at him whenever Riddle wasn't looking, and Rosier engaged him in conversation almost as often as he did Riddle. Dolohov was unchanged; tense, unyielding, and quietly seething any time the two of them conversed.

One person who had thankfully not changed one bit was Elena. She had only smiled and congratulated him when he told her exactly what had happened. That was one thing about Elena. She never looked surprised any time Harry pulled off something monumental. She just smiled and went about her business as if such things were expected.

Elena was accompanying him tonight for yet another Slub Club meeting --- the final one before spring break. The holidays were set to begin that next morning, with the Hogwarts Express taking all interested students back to London. Harry had elected to stay behind at Hogwarts once again. The Fawleys really were kind for offering, but he could not afford to ease up on his practice --- not when he was beginning to see such rapid improvements.

During Yule, Harry had been tense and waiting for Riddle to make her move. He had spent those holidays living in fear, but now, he felt excited. There would be more time to practice with Charlus, and he had sent a letter earlier today inquiring as to whether Dumbledore may be able to offer an extra lesson or two during the break. He was still painfully aware Riddle was a cut above him on a magical level, but he was riding the high of that Defence lesson --- even if Charlus had gotten the better of him just last night. It was difficult to be upset about that when their duels had been so close lately.

Slughorn was at his best that evening, leading Harry around the room like a prized trophy and raving about how he would be the nation's next Transfiguration master. Harry glanced to his side any time the professor made such claims. Riddle was annoyingly persistent in following him tonight. Even during his brief respites, she shadowed him and Elena. She looked unbothered by Slughorn's remarks any time Harry glanced her way. If anything, she had been even more talkative since the last set of duels, and certainly touchier.

"My feet are killing me," Elena muttered when they were allowed another break. She used it to take a seat at the nearest table, with both Harry and Riddle following suit.

Harry allowed himself a smirk despite Riddle's looming presence to his left. "I told you those shoes were a bad idea. What made you wear them, anyway?"

"She likes the extra height they offer," Riddle said before Elena could answer. Harry thought it was a quip, but he saw her blush. Now that he thought about it, Elena was one of the shorter members of their group. Harry had grown these past few months and was now noticeably taller than her. Most of the fifth-year boys were several inches taller than Harry, Cassie was tall for a girl, and Riddle was taller still.

"Here," said Riddle before Harry could devise a reply, waving her wand towards Elena, who actually sighed with something resembling content.

"That's better," she breathed.

Riddle smiled. "It's an obscure charm and mostly useless, but it's a nice relief on evenings like this."

Elena nodded and eyed the nearest table of drinks. Harry would have offered to fetch them, but leaving Elena alone with Riddle would be a special kind of cruelty. She stood and excused herself to fetch water a moment later, leaving Harry alone with Riddle instead.

"You ought to be more observant," she said once Elena was gone.

He frowned. "More observant about what? Elena being insecure about her height?"

Riddle smiled. "No, the fact that one of the house elves has been watching you all night."

Harry blinked. "Which one?"

Riddle gestured to a creature floating a tray of pastries above its head. It was indeed stealing a glance at him from beneath the tray. "I should also point out that the elf does not belong to Hogwarts."

"How can you possibly know that?" asked Harry.

"I have an exceptional memory and am about as trusting as I am forgetful."

Harry decided not to dignify Riddle with a reply, instead returning his attention to the place the house elf had been a moment earlier.

It was gone. *Merlin, just when I thought things were smoothing out.*

***April 10, 1943***

***The Entrance Hall***

***10:26 AM***

The rest of the night's affairs had gone off without a hitch. Having an entire Slug Club gala pass without a major incident felt strange after the last two and the drama they had brought.

Now, Harry stood beside Riddle as the two of them wished the other members of their group farewell. Harry himself was in high spirits despite Elena's departure. Dumbledore had written him back promptly and his missive at breakfast had said he would be willing to arrange more lessons during the spring break. Really, the only part of the break Harry did not eagerly anticipate was Riddle. Now that they were 'friends', she would doubtlessly try and use the emptiness of the common room to spend more time with him than ever before.

The others would soon be on the Hogwarts Express back to London, but for now, they were trapped in the long line leading to the open front doors through which blazing sunlight streamed, sending aisles of pale light sprawling across the floor and glittering off portrait frames and the marble staircase behind them.

Riddle placed a hand on Harry's shoulder. She had no regard for his personal space, and this particular gesture was one she was fond of. She did it to others, too; it was like her way of reminding people just how much control she had over them. It was annoyingly effective given how bloody tall she was.

Riddle opened her mouth, but she was interrupted by an awful scream so loud that the portraits rattled on the walls.

Harry winced as Riddle's nails bit into his shoulder. She turned with enough force to pull him with her. He pulled back, both of them drawing their wands as they rushed through the corridor.

Something cold closed around his chest as the screams died. Riddle had been with them all morning --- he'd seen her enter the common room before breakfast. They had all been tied up the night before. Harry had heard no Parseltongue --- something that had been prevalent during his second year.

One horrible thought plagued him as they pushed through the crowd, already knowing what they would find before them.

Riddle might really be innocent after all --- someone else in the castle had the power to make this all happen.

***April 11, 1943***

***Black Manor***

***9:45 PM***

Dorea excused herself early from dinner for the second family gathering in a row. Last time, the drama over Pollux's engagement to the worthless Crabbe girl had made her sick, not to mention the way her family soaked it up.

Tonight, she had excused herself --- not out of disgust over her family, but over the vengeful void of fire that erupted inside her any time she looked at Arcturus. The bastard hadn't even made mention of their situation to their father, who simply eyed Dorea every now and then. *He probably thinks we're being childish and arguing over something stupid.*

She had considered cursing Arcturus the first night back home. Knowing he wouldn't respond made the entire thing unfair. The balance of power was entirely in her favour. She would be no better than him, mirroring the abuse of power that had her so upset. *I'm better than him; I won't stoop to his level.*

She wondered what had come over him. She had always believed him the best of the family; the one who would comfort her when she needed him, the one who would listen when their father ignored her, the one who had been there through thick and thin. *I can't believe he's doing this to me now.*

More than a month had passed, and still, the pain and anger raged on. Still she trembled, nails biting into her palms any time she saw him.

"I thought I might find you here."

Dorea went for her wand, but Arcturus had his out already. He held it defensively and waited. "Go away!" she spat at him.

"No."

The word struck harder than a Bludgeoning Curse. "What do you mean no?"

"I mean exactly what I said. You've been avoiding me all break and now I find you like this?"

"Both of which are entirely your fault!" Shouting in this house was unwise, but Dorea didn't care. Arcturus had probably warded the corridor they stood in already, and if he hadn't, so be it. She was far beyond caring what her family thought of her. She cared for very few of them.

"So I'm right in assuming this is about Pavonis, then?"

It was the way he spoke --- exasperated, resigned, and exhausted --- like he was speaking to a child he'd known would act up.

Dorea's nostrils flared. "Of course it's about him! He was my best friend, Arcturus; the first real friend I'd made at Hogwarts! What did you think was going to happen? Did you really think you were making my life better by ruining my first friendship? Did you expect me to just smile and thank you for it?"

"You make it sound like I enjoyed it."

"Maybe you did, I don't know. Virgo seemed to enjoy making the same choice before Riddle stepped in."

Her brother ground his teeth together. "I would like to think I'm better than Parkinson."

"So would I, but she at least had the courage to stand up to Riddle instead of putting her little sister through hell because she was afraid of her."

"Making a proclamation in the midst of a crowded room isn't courage. If you disagree, you're in the wrong house."

"My point stands."

"Does it? I'm no Malfoy and we both know that. Funny how both of us had the same idea about getting people away from Riddle. Why?"

"Malfoy didn't care about getting people away from her, he just wanted to antagonize her."

"Do you think so, little sister? Has Malfoy fooled you so completely with his acting?" Dorea opened her mouth but closed it when Arcturus went on. "Abraxas Malfoy is not incompetent. Riddle has made a more dangerous enemy than she realizes. He can't match her magically, but he's still a threat in other ways."

"What's your point?"

"My point is that two of the most intelligent people in our house decided to remove people from Riddle's proximity. Do you think that's a coincidence?"

"I've never once argued that Riddle is anything but trouble."

"Yet you continued floating around her?"

"I continued floating around Harry, Arcturus!"

"It amounts to the same thing."

"No, it doesn't! I'm starting to think I'm not the only friendless one at Hogwarts. If I wasn't, maybe you'd understand that some sacrifices are worth making for people you care about."

"Some sacrifices are suicide. Do you think Riddle's little group of attack dogs is going to break up when they graduate? Do you have any idea what she may lead them to do in the real world?"

"She won't do anything. You underestimate Harry."

Arcturus paused for a moment, then nodded. "I think that last bit is the first intelligent thing you've said tonight. I'll admit, I've underestimated Pavonis --- the rumours have made that obvious. I'm just not convinced he can keep you out of the absolute shitstorm Riddle's going to stir up."

"And if he could?" She did not dare hope.

"If he could what?"

"If he could keep me out of danger around Riddle, if he could convince you of that?"

Arcturus studied her for a long moment. "You two think remarkably alike."

Dorea frowned. "What do you mean?"

Arcturus reached into the pocket of his robes and removed a bit of parchment. It was a simple message written in a hand she recognized as Harry's.

*Black,*

*I understand why you've ordered Dorea to cut ties with me, but I want to meet with you and explain why you don't need to. I know that you worry about Riddle, but I honestly don't think Dorea will be in real danger around her.*

*I hope you respond quickly and that we can meet soon. I would rather Dorea and I not have to deal with this much longer.*

*Regards,*

*Hadrian Pavonis*

What was it Harry knew that she didn't? Dorea was exaggerating her confidence in him, but he really did seem confident. One of the reasons he had stayed behind during the winter holidays had been to watch Riddle. When they'd returned, Dorea assumed Harry was outplayed. Was it possible Harry really was the one in control?

*I have to believe it.* "Are you going to meet with him?" she asked once finished reading, taking great care to keep her voice measured.

Arcturus nodded. "I am. I underestimated how much this would affect you and will at least hear him out." He raised a hand to forestall her thanks. "I'm not promising I'll agree with anything he says. I want you to be happy, but not at the cost of your life being ruined without you even realizing it."

Dorea nodded; it was the best she could hope for as of now. She would just have to trust that Harry knew what he was doing.

***Meanwhile, in an abandoned classroom back at Hogwarts...***

Harry's shield wavered under the weight of Charlus's onslaught. Elena had said how much power Harry's spells packed, but he had never understood. Duelling Charlus opened his eyes some; the two of them were close to equals in strength. Charlus was more experienced and more technically skillful, whilst Harry had unmatched control over magic.

Harry often wondered about that. Cerastes had implied magic might come more easily once he learned to sense it, but lately, everything felt almost intuitive, not only in his duels, but in his lessons with Dumbledore too.

The only thing he still struggled with was casting nonverbal casting, and only with new spells.

It still threw Charlus off. Harry dropped his shield and counterattacked. Charlus's reaction was a bit slow. *He's too used to me incanting. I can use that; he's been trying to get me to see openings lately, let's show him that I listen.*

Harry swished his wand and caused stones to rise from the floor around Charlus, who raised his own wand wardingly towards them, waiting to see what form they took. Harry fired a few spells through the gaps between stones to keep Charlus occupied before vanishing the stones and aiming his wand at Charlus.

"Avis Oppugno."

Charlus, having learned from his mistake during the first duel he'd lost, let loose a torrent of flames to intercept the swarm of birds, but they never came. Instead, a volley of arrows sailed straight through the fire, now alight and even more dangerous.

Charlus yelped and dove to his right, which Harry had expected. A well-placed Disarming Charm caught him in mid-dive and, for the second time since their practices had begun, Harry found himself clutching Charlus's wand.

"Bugger!" the Potter heir cursed after regaining his feet. "That was clever; well played."

Harry grinned and tossed Charlus his wand. There really was more to magic than knowing spells and shouting incantations --- it was one of the many lessons he'd learned this year.

Harry had mostly gotten over thoughts about his previous life, but it was easy to think them when realizing how much he'd learned or how far he'd come. *No use thinking about any of that. What did Dumbledore say back in first year?*

*"It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live."*

***April 12, 1943***

***Horace Slughorn's Office***

***1:44 PM***

Slughorn had repeated his practice from the winter holidays, that being to host members of his Slug Club privately for meals in his office. This time, his conversation with Harry was somewhat different. He was more interested in Harry's work than ever before, questioning him in detail about exactly how far ahead he was in each of his subjects.

Slughorn must have heard the rumours like everyone else and wished to know how much truth there was to them. There was no real reason Harry had for hiding them, so he told the professor exactly how his duel with Cassiopeia had gone.

Slughorn beamed at him. "I'm glad to see that pass I gave you during the holidays is being put to good use," he said with a chortle.

Harry smiled. That pass had less to do with his progress than Slughorn thought, but it had been helpful and if the man wanted to believe he had done more than he had, that was perfectly fine by Harry. It was the exact sort of assumption that would keep Slughorn loyal.

That would keep Slughorn loyal? Merlin, when had he started thinking like that? It was no wonder why so many people thought of Slytherin House as a bunch of manipulative gits if this was how Harry thought after less than a year in their ranks. Yet... it didn't bother him as much as he might have expected, but then again, he had not been blind to his manipulative side. He had lied to a number of people about Riddle, his intentions, and his confidence.

"Thanks again for that, Professor, it's been a big help."

Slughorn waved his hand. "Any time, m'boy, any time. It's rare that I get the pleasure to work with one so talented. My duty as an educator is to make sure that talent is fulfilled in every way possible."

Harry bit his lip; there was something he meant to discuss with Slughorn and this was likely the best opportunity he would get. "Professor?"

"Yes, Harry?"

"How much do you know about Arcturus Black?"

Slughorn frowned. "Arcturus? Why, I've taught him since his arrival here. He's in my NEWT-level Potions class."

"What about as a person? He seems to come to most Slug Club meetings, but he never says much."

"He is a quiet boy, yes. That's really to be expected from the Black heir. Always hounded by the other pureblood children, always pressured by his family to make the wisest decisions --- I imagine he appreciates any time he can get alone."

"What is he like? When he's not just being quiet, I mean."

Slughorn massaged his round stomach as he thought. "Well, he's never lacked confidence. I could count on two hands the number of questions he's ever asked me in Potions and the boy's graduating this June."

So Arcturus was sure of his decisions and rarely second-guessed them. That was less than ideal for Harry, but not altogether troubling. Such things were to be expected from one such as Arcturus Black.

"Sir, Dorea's always been a bit distant from the rest of her family. I don't think she cares much for the politics and whatnot."

Slughorn nodded. "That fits with what I know of her, yes."

"Do you think Arcturus is the same?"

Slughorn thought for a moment, then nodded. "I would think so. His father hardly stopped politicking whilst at Hogwarts. I don't imagine it's a coincidence that neither of his children seem fond of it."

So Arcturus's father had forced him into a position he did not wish to hold. That was something Harry could more easily use. It was something he was intimately familiar with; he understood exactly how powerful such feelings were.

Yes, that was certainly something of value. It had been one of the many reasons Harry had changed so drastically. Now, all he had to do was point it out to someone else and hope it led to even more changes.

***April 16, 1943***

***The Dungeons***

***10:24 PM***

So far, spring break had passed in what felt like no time at all. In two days, the students would return to the castle and on the third day, classes would resume. It would be nice to have Elena back at Hogwarts, but Harry had quite enjoyed spring break. Dumbledore had slotted him in for three lessons, he and Charlus had practiced almost every day, and Harry had even slipped down into the Chamber of Secrets.

All in all, it had been productive, and the best part was that Riddle had been shockingly distant and had not seen fit to impose her presence upon him at all.

Until tonight, anyway.

Harry stepped out from a secret passageway hidden behind a suit of armour and into a corridor that always felt drafty. It was the place Riddle had asked him to meet her that night when they parted at breakfast. She was out on her prefect rounds, but apparently, there was something she wanted to show Harry. He almost wished it was something to do with the Chamber of Secrets. He was pretty sure by now she wasn't involved, but there was no proof and he would rather know she was guilty than wonder if she was innocent.

The more Harry thought about it, the more he decided that a part of him wanted Riddle to be the Heir of Slytherin. The unknown was daunting and it had been the biggest obstacle during second year. It was not something he wished to deal with again. The devil he knew was dangerous, but at least he could anticipate what might come next. If Riddle wasn't the Heir and there was another, well, that would just be one more problem added to Harry's list.

Riddle shimmered into being just feet from him. Her Disillusionment Charm was perfect --- Harry had never once seen it falter and he wondered exactly how she did it.

"I've always appreciated your punctuality," Riddle said as she began leading him in the direction of the Slytherin common room and, beyond it, the stone steps leading up into the main castle.

"Likewise."

"Who do you think is behind the attack?"

Harry almost stumbled. "What?"

"The attacks," Riddle repeated. "Who is it you think is behind them?"

Their footsteps echoed in the hall as Harry formulated an answer. "I don't know. I'm not sure why you expected me to."

Harry felt something change in the air between them. "I hoped you might be honest."

"Honest?"

"Yes, honest. I know you suspect me; I would rather you have said it."

"And what would have happened if I had?" he asked, knowing there was no reason to argue with her now. "What would you have done? If you were behind them, you wouldn't have admitted it."

"I would have."

Harry's steps faltered. "I don't believe you."

"Nor do I expect you to, but it's the truth."

"Would you tell the others?"

"None but Cassie."

"And me?"

"And you."

"Why?"

"Because if I was behind these attacks, they would be to serve a purpose I think you could sympathize with." There was a long pause before Riddle turned to inspect him. "I once considered doing something similar, but my plans were dashed."

A chill ran up Harry's spine. This was the most openly she had ever discussed the Chamber of Secrets. "And you suspect me of dashing them?" he asked, not knowing where the boldness came from.

"I do. I wonder if knowing my goals would have changed how you acted."

They had reached the stone stairs now and began ascending into the castle proper. Harry felt nervous energy swirling inside him. This conversation was dangerous and he could not fathom why Riddle was having it with him now --- unless her plan was to try and pry information from him before making him her next victim. That was logical, but he doubted that was her plan.

"I think you'd have to be more specific about exactly what you think I've stopped. I've had a complicated year."

Emily laughed. "I really do like you, you know --- much more than the others. It's painfully dull when people stop viewing you as a person and refuse to engage with you at all."

"Do you like me enough to answer my question?"

She laughed again. "Almost, but not quite. If we're to truly be friends, I won't have you asking such sloppy questions. A ten-year-old could have recognized that as a probe."

They rounded the corner and walked past the Great Hall and the marble staircase, turning down a familiar corridor leading towards the hospital wing. A bright shape glided out from behind the next corridor and Harry almost jumped, but it was just Nearly-Headless Nick. The ghost just dipped his head and kept on moving, shining brighter than anything in the hall as he slowly glided down an adjacent corridor.

"Let me try something different then," Harry said once Nick had glided out of earshot, "What exactly is it you're showing me?"

"Proof of my innocence."

The hospital wing door loomed into view. Emily turned to face Harry and brought a finger to his lips. They burned with an odd heat when she pulled the digit away, but before he could react, she tapped him on the head with her wand and something cold seemed to run down his back.

It was the feeling one got when disillusioned, but it was stronger than the one Harry had used back in the library --- doubtlessly one of Riddle's perfect iterations.

Disillusioned and silent, the two crept into the hospital wing. Harry felt for any wards, but there were none. The room itself was empty but for two beds with their curtains drawn, their fabric like liquid silver when bathed in moonlight shining through the window. Riddle swept her wand around them and Harry felt something heavy and oppressive take hold in the air. It was a Silencing Charm --- now, they could speak openly.

"Your proof is in the hospital wing?"

Riddle just nodded, stepping forward and pulling back the curtains on one of the two beds. It was Myrtle's. She remained the same way Harry remembered her last --- unmoving with pale skin and closed eyes...

Wait... closed eyes? None of the victims attacked by the basilisk could possibly have closed eyes. Not unless the matron had closed the eyelids. Harry forced his mind clear but focused on replaying the exact memory of Myrtle being attacked. In that too, her eyes were closed.

That was not the only odd thing, either. She was paler than usual. That never happened to any of the victims attacked by Cerastes during Harry's own time. And what was underneath her skin? The veins... they looked wrong somehow --- filled with something dark.

"She's been poisoned," Harry breathed, connecting the dots.

"Poisoned by the Draught of Living Death," Riddle confirmed in a whisper. "A draught whose ingredients cost a fortune. Professor Slughorn's supply has been out for months; I checked after the first night coming here."

"You have rich friends," Harry whispered back. "Any of them could have gotten you the ingredients."

"Unlikely. Some of the ingredients are shared by very powerful healing potions that are at a premium and almost exclusively being distributed in areas impacted by the war. Cassie could likely have secured them for me, but none of the others. Even then, she couldn't have gotten them without being questioned. I imagine it would have caused quite a stir in her family, one Dorea would have told you about."

"By the time the first attack happened, I wasn't speaking with Dorea."

"Given how long the potion takes to brew, you were still speaking with her at the time its ingredients arrived at Hogwarts."

Harry opened his mouth to counter, but there was nothing. She had him. "You wouldn't have used a potion," he mused aloud, pulse quickening. "It's too easily traceable --- you're not that sloppy." Riddle nodded, but Harry frowned. "Why are they still unconscious? The Draught of Living Death has an antidote, does it not?"

"Do you remember how there were screams during both attacks?" Harry nodded. "They were hit with the Cruciatus Curse soon before the potion was ingested."

Harry's frown deepened. "What difference does it make?"

"A large one. The Draught of Living Death slows down all bodily functions. Slower blood flow, for example, is the reason she's so pale. The Cruciatus Curse overstimulates the nerves. Her body hasn't been working fast enough to counteract its effects. If she was woken up right now, the shock and pain might well stop her heart."

Harry's eyes widened. "So is she stuck like this?"

"No. They'll just have to wait for her body to recover in its sluggish state. Once that happens, they can revive her. The other --- a third-year Hufflepuff girl --- is the same. As I'm sure you expected, she's also a muggleborn."

"The attack earlier in the year," Harry remembered, "someone used the Cruciatus Curse then. They could have been practicing."

"That's exactly what I think he was doing."

"He?" Harry asked, turning to face her, watching for any shifts in her expression. All he got was a nod. "You know who it is, don't you? You've known this whole time."

"I've suspected, but I didn't know until after the Hufflepuff girl was attacked. The sample size was too small. Usually, I would still say it is, but the circumstances are so specific that I think two is enough."

"Who is it?" Harry asked, glancing involuntarily around the room as though the culprit would come for them from the shadows.

"Have you not put it together?" Riddle asked, turning away from Harry and moving back towards the room's exit. "Someone claiming to be an Heir weeks after I reveal myself as a Parselmouth, using a method similar to myths about a monstrous snake some say Salazar Slytherin once controlled? Someone who not only did both of these things, but made sure their first victim was one I was known to have associated with."

It all came together. He had reminisced in the past just how much more dangerous this batch of Slytherins was compared to his own time, but he had no idea just how far the Malfoys had fallen in two generations.

**Chapter 28: The Ultimatum**

***April 17, 1943***

***The Chamber of Secrets***

***11:24 PM***

The last twenty-four hours felt like a distorted blur that moved past Harry's eyes too fast to track. He remembered walking back towards the common room with Riddle, but even then, his thoughts had been murky. Sleep had not helped in clearing his mind.

Dreams had plagued him --- dreams of a dark hooded figure reminiscent of the time Harry had seen Quirrell in the Forbidden Forest. The figure had stooped over a fallen victim and Harry had tried to move forward, but something pinned him in place and forced him to watch as the figure began to drink the victim's blood. When the figure looked up it was not Quirrell at all, but Abraxas Malfoy, a red smear covering his lips as he smiled at Harry and raised his wand, bathing Harry's world in vivid green light as high, cold laughter rang all around him.

Harry did little for most of the day. He told himself that he was exploring the castle, but really, he was wandering aimlessly in the hope that his mind might finally finish processing everything it had learned last night.

Riddle really did seem to be innocent. There was no definitive proof despite what she said, but every sign pointed clearly towards Abraxas. It was too early to say for sure, but for now, he would focus on Abraxas.

Harry shivered. He would have felt calmer if the culprit *had* been using Cerastes. Harry was grateful the basilisk appeared not to have betrayed him and a weight had lifted from his shoulders, but at least that would have been something Harry could openly confront. Abraxas Malfoy sneaking quietly around the school and subjecting victims to torture and poison was a more difficult opponent to face.

Part of him wondered why he felt inclined to help at all. This was not his fight. He had been dead set on stopping Riddle's plans, but these strikes appeared not to be of her design. They were also non-lethal so long as no one prematurely woke the victims, so in a way, it was less pressing than the attacks had been during Harry's own time.

Perhaps it was because he felt responsible. If Harry hadn't intervened, Riddle would have opened the Chamber of Secrets. That would have been a problem all of its own, but it would have spared the school from this. *Guess I've still got some Gryffindor in me.*

Other than his duelling session earlier that day with Charlus, Harry had felt adrift ever since leaving the hospital wing. That time with Charlus had been nice, but it had only made things more complicated. For the first time since arriving back in the past, Harry felt himself drifting along without purpose. It was probably the most unsettling thing he'd felt in the past eight months.

***Earlier that evening...***

That night had been the single most competitive duelling session Harry and Charlus had ever had. Harry had gone in with low expectations given how clouded his mind felt, but in a way, it had been good for him. His reactions were sharp, and when he relied on them, everything flowed naturally.

They had duelled six times and split the rounds three apiece. A ray of vibrant sunlight seemed to pierce the clouds surrounding Harry's mind, giving him a moment of pride-filled clarity. This was the first time Harry had ever matched Charlus consistently during a single night of practice.

"I don't know how the hell you do it," Charlus said with a shake of his head.

"Do what?" asked Harry.

"Get so much better so fast. It's like I'm duelling a new partner every week and, every week, it gets harder. I've never seen anything like it."

"I wish I had the answer," Harry said, running a hand through his hair. "I could probably improve even faster if I did."

"Mate, if you improved any faster, you'd be conscripted by the ministry."

Harry frowned. "Is that actually something they can do?"

"No, but that kind of kills the joke."

Harry smiled. "And I don't know how you do *that*."

"Do what?"

"Joke about the war like it's nothing. After, you know..."

"My mum?"

"And your dad. He's still out there fighting, isn't he?"

Charlus nodded, a far away look in his eyes. "It's easier to laugh. I learned pretty quick that I don't like the other options."

"Then maybe you learn just as fast as me after all."

Harry's parents had been gone for years and laughing about it was still not something he could do. It was a different kind of strength, he thought. Someday soon, he might become a better duellist than Charlus, but in this way, he thought the Potter heir would always be stronger.

"It's different, I guess. I imagine that sort of thing comes down to your upbringing. My mum was always good about things like that, especially once the war started up. I was pretty young when it all started and it got rough here in England for a while. This was before her and my father went overseas to help."

"My parents were never much for joking."

His father had actually seemed lighthearted the one time they'd spoken, but it was difficult to tell for sure. The Dursleys had not been, and those were the only relatives who had impacted his upbringing.

Not for the first time, Harry contemplated what it would take to ensure Vernon and Petunia Dursley never found each other. It would be easy. Tracking down Vernon's parents sounded simple, and after that...

Harry cleared his mind. He had thought about the Dursleys and wiping them from existence before, but when had he actively begun fantasizing about it? Maybe Cerastes was rubbing off on him more than he'd realized, or perhaps his fallout with Dorea had turned him into a cynic.

"I'll corrupt you one day," Charlus said with a slight smile.

"Maybe," Harry said, doubting it but smiling back all the same. "Care to educate me first?"

"Educate you about what?"

"Potions."

Charlus actually laughed. "You're coming to the wrong bloke. It's a miracle I even got into Slughorn's NEWT-level Potions class."

"I don't need help brewing them. I just need someone who knows about ingredients. I figured with the whole hair-care potion thing the Potters have going on, you might know a thing or two."

Charlus shrugged. "I'm not sure I'll know anything, but you can ask."

"How hard would it be to get ingredients for the Draught of Living Death?"

Charlus's eyes widened. "What the hell do you want those for?"

"I don't."

"Then why---"

"It has to do with a theory of mine about the attacks. I'm not ready to say more than that yet. Just trust me on this one."

"Hard," Charlus said after a long moment. "Expensive as hell, too."

"I read somewhere that a lot of the ingredients are used in healing potions. Is it true that getting a hold of those is harder right now with the war going on?"

"I'm not sure, but that would make sense. Any time Dad talked about the last war, he mentioned shortages and things like that. I reckon you could still get them, but you'd probably have to pay an arm and a leg if you wanted them any time soon."

Harry nodded. In a way, it was good news --- it meant that Riddle might actually have been telling him the truth --- but it still sent shivers up his spine. Any time Harry thought this year was incapable of surprising him further, something new lunged at him from the shadows and reared its ugly head.

***Back in the present...***

Harry grimaced at the memory. Never had he imagined someone being honest would make him more uncomfortable than if they had been lying.

He forced those thoughts down and turned towards the stone statue looming high above the chamber, its long shadow reaching across the floor.

**"Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts four."**

The massive jaw unhinged as the sound of Cerastes slithering free filled Harry's ears. His eyes were tightly shut like usual, but over the months he had grown adept at judging where Cerastes was.

**"Why is it that any time you come, you seem so troubled?"**

That drew a smile from Harry, though the expression lacked any real humour. **"Probably because anywhere I go these days, I'm usually troubled."**

**"What has the usurper done this time?"**

**"Decided to be honest."** Harry shifted awkwardly from foot to foot. "**I think she has, anyway."**

**"Should that not make you less troubled? Why is it you humans make so little sense?"**

**"I wonder the same thing sometimes."**

**"That wasn't the important question."**

**"I know, but it was the easy one."** Harry thought for a moment, pondering the very thing that had puzzled him all day. **"There have been... attacks on students."**

**"Attacks?"** The hairs on the back of Harry's neck stood up. Cerastes sounded almost excited. Sometimes, Harry forgot just how bloodthirsty the basilisk was.

**"On students, yes."**

**"You've said nothing of these before."**

Harry hesitated. **"They started recently,"** he lied, hoping the Occlumency he'd learned from Riddle's journal would help him conceal his true thoughts when speaking Parseltongue.

Harry somehow thought Cerastes was unconvinced, but he didn't press. **"And they have something to do with the usurper?"**

**"I thought so, but now, I don't. She's apparently been investigating and showed me what she's discovered last night. It was convincing and not really something that can be faked."**

**"Why does this trouble you more? You've made the usurper sound more intelligent and dangerous than most. Should it not be a relief she is innocent?"**

**"Probably, but I know her. I had guesses about how she was setting everything up and plans that might have stopped her."** Harry ran a hand through his hair, making an even greater mess of it. "**It feels like everything I know just got flipped upside down. It's frustrating. This whole year, I feel like I've been working against the usurper, but now... I don't know. It's like I don't have a purpose."**

Cerastes remained quiet for a moment. **"I do not understand this purpose. What is it you want?"**

**"Want?"**

**"Yes, want. What is it you want to do?"**

That was actually a daunting question. All Harry had considered since landing in the past was Riddle. If Riddle wasn't responsible for the attacks, that could mean she really was walking a different path.

That was when Harry realized what was putting him so ill at ease. Perhaps his plans had been uprooted. If this meant Riddle was different enough as not to become Voldemort... Harry did not know what that meant for him.

**"To stop the attacks."** Despite his focus on Riddle, most of his plans for this year had boiled down to that.

**"Do you know who is responsible for the attacks?"**

**"Yes."**

**"I could kill them."**

Harry sighed. **"My answer hasn't changed."**

**"Then formulate a better idea. Purpose sounds foolish. Do what it is you desire."**

That sounded too simple to be effective, but Harry found himself nodding along. He would need to rethink Riddle and what her changes could mean for him, but in the meantime, there could be some benefit to breaking things down like Cerastes suggested.

It was a good idea, Harry decided. Merlin, lots had changed this year. *I never thought I'd start judging ideas by how snake-like they are.*

***April 18, 1943***

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***8:58 PM***

Students poured back into the Slytherin common room for the first time in more than a week. The noise was jarring to Harry after so much time spent alone or in scarce company. Elena was somewhere among the herd of bodies, as was Dorea, but Harry's eyes searched not for his friends, but his enemy.

It was easy enough picking Abraxas Malfoy out from the crowd. His head loomed above most others' and his pale hair was brighter than almost everything else in the dimly-lit common room. His eyes remained on Nott, with whom he was sharing a conversation. They did not cut towards Riddle once.

Riddle herself had been seated beside Harry as they awaited the others' return, but now she was standing and greeting the other members of her group.

Elena slipped quietly by her. Harry saw Riddle's eyes flick towards her, but she let her pass.

Elena slid gracefully into the seat beside Harry, who turned to engage her in conversation before noticing that something felt off. Elena looked tenser than usual.

Harry opened his mouth to quietly ask what was going on, but he felt something brush up against his hand. It took a great effort not to look down, but Harry trusted his instincts and unfolded his fist. His fingers closed around a piece of parchment as he nodded minutely.

His pulse quickened. This message could only be one thing.

He scanned the common room but saw no sign of Arcturus Black. His pulse grew fiercer still. *If he's too worried to be around when the note is passed, then this might be harder than I thought.*

***April 24, 1943***

***The Forbidden Forest***

***6:58 AM***

Sneaking out of the castle had once been easy, but those days had died when Harry's invisibility cloak was left behind. It was certainly easier than it had been a few months ago now that Harry's Disillusionment Charm was coming along, but it could still be tricky.

The snow had melted weeks ago, but the grass beneath Harry's feet was still coated in a thin layer of frost, the air heavy with a thick fog. *That works nicely for me.* If anyone looked out a window, it would be much more difficult to spot him moving across the grounds and towards the Black Forest on their edge.

Harry felt his companion before he saw him. The fog had not relented by the time he reached the forest's edge and he could hardly see ten feet in front of him. Still he could feel a change in the air; an odd density he had come to associate with spells meant to ward or obscure things from others.

"You first," Harry muttered, coming up just feet short of where he thought the older boy stood.

If Arcturus was surprised, he didn't show it, instead lifting his own enchantment and shimmering into view. Harry let his own spell fall and the two boys stared at each other, emerald green eyes locked with their stormy grey counterparts.

"How long have you known the Disillusionment Charm?" Black asked, still not removing his eyes from Harry.

"A while now."

"That's impressive magic for a fourth year."

"Impressive enough for you to lift your orders off of Dorea?"

Black frowned. "Straight to the point, I see. I can respect that."

"You know that all you're doing is hurting her, right? You remember how Marianna looked that night in the common room? Do you not think Dorea felt the same way?"

"If I didn't, this meeting wouldn't be happening, and it will end if you try and guilt trip me again."

"I'm not trying to do anything. I'm asking because it doesn't make sense to me. Dorea always spoke highly of you. Now I realize she must have been wrong, so I'm trying to work out what kind of man I'm dealing with."

This was a risky approach, but he felt it was right. Everything he had heard about Arcturus indicated a pragmatic worry surrounding Riddle. If Harry wanted to win him over, he would need to convince the boy that Riddle was someone he could handle. That would not be accomplished by lying down and begging for terms.

"You're bold, Pavonis, I'll give you that. I don't know many people who would come at me the way you have."

"I'm not most people."

"No, you're not. If you were, I would have ignored you."

Harry raised a challenging eyebrow. "I thought you just said the only reason this meeting was happening was because of Dorea."

Black snorted. "Clever. This meeting wouldn't happen if you were average and it wouldn't happen if Dorea wasn't as bothered as she was. I wish she would get over herself, but here we are."

"Why do you wish she would get over herself? It sounds like you don't care about her, but then you say that this meeting is because of her. None of it makes sense."

"Take a guess."

Harry frowned. "You're worried that Riddle might try and use her after Hogwarts."

"Close. Dorea is willful, but I'm worried that Riddle will force her hand. She'll put Dorea in some kind of situation that makes refusing whatever she's planned impossible."

"And you don't think Dorea could avoid something like that?"

"Against most people? Sure. Against Riddle? I have my doubts. All it would take is an Imperius Curse, and Dorea will never be half the witch Riddle is. Better in some ways, but not with magic."

He could understand where Arcturus was coming from. His mind, too, often concocted the worst imaginable outcomes for situations involving Riddle.

"What if I told you I could stop that from happening?"

Arcturus locked eyes with him again. "And what if I asked how the hell you plan to do that?"

"I can match Riddle. You've seen me do it before."

"I saw you defend your mind against wandless Legilimency, that's not the same thing. I have no way of knowing whether you would have been able to do it if she was using a wand, and even if you could, the Mind Arts are just one small piece of the puzzle."

"Have you not noticed that she treats me differently than the others? She never gives me orders and I have my space when I want it. She never once bothered Dorea when she was with me." Harry raised an eyebrow again, challenging Arcturus to deny it. "Why do you think that is, Black?"

Black dipped his head. "There is definitely something about you and I'm sure Riddle realizes it. She could be wary because of how unknown you are; none of what you said necessarily means anything."

It had been a slim hope, but he wished Arcturus would have accepted that at face value. The problem was that Harry really didn't have much to work with.

"So what? You came all the way out here just to dismiss any arguments so you could keep making your sister's life hell?"

Black's expression hardened. "I wouldn't have come out here just to listen to arguments one way or the other. Merlin knows there are more appealing things to be doing."

"Then why did you come?"

"To make an ultimatum."

Harry felt heat rise up in his cheeks. He had effectively been played. Black had forced him to show his hand despite never planning to consider it, and just for him to dictate the terms anyway. Merlin, politics were infuriating --- Slughorn could keep every last bit of them.

"What sort of ultimatum?"

"I need you to prove that you can handle Riddle. I don't think you're her intellectual equal and there isn't any way to prove it. I'll settle for her magical equal or better for now."

Harry felt a bubble of dread well up in the pit of his stomach. "And how do I prove that we're magical equals?"

Arcturus watched Harry very closely. "I think Merrythought has you two set to duel next month..."

**By ACI100**

**Chapter 29: Awareness**

***May 8, 1943***

***Albus Dumbledore's Office***

***8:00 PM***

Weeks had passed since Harry's meeting with Arcturus. His duel with Riddle loomed closer each morning he woke, and now, it was but three short days away. Knots tightened inside his chest each morning he woke but so far, he had seen no such tension from Riddle. *I shouldn't have shown so much in my last duel --- she's seen my best and thinks she can beat it. It just made her more confident.*

Harry had known for months this duel would come, but it had always been a clash between him and the girl who was to become Voldemort. Now he was less sure. If she was to become Voldemort, surely she would never have warned him? Voldemort was the evil he was used to facing --- the evil he had beaten against all odds. Riddle was different --- it was a different sort of challenge he felt much less prepared for.

Now it was no longer him against Voldemort with the fate of Britain on the line --- it was him against Riddle. A friendship he cherished hung in the balance in place of the nation. *Why does that make me more nervous? Those stakes are lower? How have I become so selfish?*

"You look laboured," Dumbledore said once Harry entered his office, as though the professor was reading his thoughts.

"I haven't slept well this week, but I'll be fine."

"Is it your upcoming duel that has you so worried?" Harry's eyes widened and Dumbledore smiled. "Did you think the staff was unaware of Professor Merrythought's practices?"

"What do you think of them, sir? Some of the students have said that some professors don't like it."

"I support Professor Merrythought and think that her decision is wise. The idea of students unable to defend themselves with all that is going on makes me uneasy."

"So have the professors been keeping up with the duels or something?"

"Professor Slughorn certainly has been, but most have paid them little heed."

Harry had to suppress a smile as his mind conjured images of Slughorn brandishing the Sorting Hat at the other professors whilst trying to convince them to gamble on upcoming matches. It really didn't seem all that out of character.

"But you know I'm duelling Riddle on Monday?"

"You two serve as exceptions. Professor Merrythought has raved about the both of you, which is rare for her. Given how many of the other professors feel the same way about you both, there has been a degree of interest surrounding the pair of you specifically."

Harry tried to imagine the faculty of his own time gossiping about a pair of students. Stern Professor McGonagall would never be caught dead doing something so unprofessional, and Snape would probably rather drown himself in a potion than praise a pair of rising duellists. Professors Sprout and Flitwick might be the type, but Harry doubted they would have many companions.

"It is stressing me out a bit," Harry admitted, "but it's a bit of everything. The duel, the attacks, the war..."

"All perfectly reasonable things to worry over. I can only advise you to take one step at a time. Every day is different and new. With each, we put the past behind us and accept our future."

It was similar in a way to what Dumbledore had told Harry about the Mirror of Erised. This Dumbledore used different words, but they amounted to the same thing in the end.

"Do you have any advice about the duel, Professor?"

"About your duel against Miss Riddle? No, I think not. I have never watched her duel and can therefore offer you little."

Harry knew how Dumbledore felt about Riddle; he had seen it in his eyes the night Aragog had gotten loose. Harry considered his options. Did he dare push further? Dumbledore was honourable, but Harry had never known him to follow protocol to the letter. It was probably unprofessional for a professor to pick sides in matters such as these, but if Harry worded it carefully...

"What about a general duelling question, Professor? Would you feel comfortable answering that?"

"I am no duellist, Master Pavonis. I never officially competed and my experiences in the field are limited."

"And if I wanted to ask you anyway?"

Dumbledore's lips twitched. "I am an educator. I would have no reason not to answer a harmless question about something so relevant to life nowadays."

"How would you go about beating someone who's more skilled and more powerful than you are? Someone who knows more magic and has more weapons."

Dumbledore considered his question for a moment before answering. "I would concede those advantages and consider what facets of the duel may be in my favour. I would play to my strengths and, above all else, I would avoid engaging in an extended duel that looks at all conventional."

Harry frowned. "What do you mean by the last bit, Professor?"

"If your opponent has all the advantages you mentioned, trading spells back and forth would only lead to defeat."

"What if you varied your attacks and mixed in things like Transfiguration?"

"I suspect that would help. It is thinking along the right lines."

"And what are those lines, sir?"

Dumbledore raised an eyebrow. "Do you not see them yet?"

Harry considered for a moment before, slowly, it dawned on him. "If you can't beat them in a straightforward duel, you have to add tricks and variables."

That fit well. His early wins against Charlus had come that way, and even things like feinting with false incantations were crafty little tricks that could get one ahead. Not that Harry expected party tricks like that to be enough against Riddle, but it gave him something to focus on.

He had heard once that problems were best solved in parts. They often looked daunting, but when broken down into individual pieces, they often became more manageable. This appeared to be one of those times. Defeating Riddle felt like scaling a mountain, but isolating her weaknesses felt only like ascending a steep hill.

"Exciting esoteric questions aside," Dumbledore said from across the desk, "I believe we'd best be getting to the topic at hand."

Harry snapped back to attention. "What are we covering today, sir?"

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "You are ahead of my original schedule, so I thought, given your current worries, we would focus on something more practical."

Harry felt his face split into an ear-to-ear grin, his fingers curled as if around his wand. Every little advantage he could get was welcome, and Harry planned to implement as many of them as possible in the next seventy-two hours.

***May 11, 1943***

***The Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom***

***1:12 PM***

Harry had never felt anything quite like the atmosphere present that Tuesday afternoon when he entered Professor Merrythought's class. It appeared that he was the last student to do so, which meant he earned the room's full and undivided attention. It felt like he was the Boy-Who-Lived all over again. Escaping the stares for the best part of a year had been a blessing. They had returned some after his duel against Cassie, but nothing like now.

His heart raced, but not from the stares. This feeling was familiar and he felt himself relax. It was how he felt before plunging after Quirrell, before entering the chamber, and before Hermione spun the time turner. *I've always won when feeling like this.*

Professor Merrythought was taking attendance, but Harry wouldn't have known that had he not been watching. It was like none of the sound around him registered, all blending together in a dull haze that left his mind muddled. He answered appropriately when she looked at him, surprised the single word came as easily as it did.

Harry glanced across the room. Riddle was a remarkable actress, but that was what gave her away. Her posture was always perfect, but today, it was a skillful imitation of perfect --- just a touch too rigid. Riddle's eyes did not wander as freely as usual, either. They focused on everything, as though analyzing the field of battle.

It was a small victory. Just because Riddle took him seriously didn't mean she wasn't confident. Harry saw no signs of doubt, just focus. His heart fluttered again. A focused Riddle would not spend time toying with him like she had with others. That would have presented openings and played into his hands.

Harry watched the first pair step up to duel and tried to focus on them. There was no new angle from which he could examine his own conflict, so thinking about it was useless. The closest he got to taking his mind off his own duel was wondering for a moment in which order the duels would take place. It did not take long for him to realize how obvious that was. Professor Merrythought was more rigid and better at hiding it, but she was every bit as dramatic as Slughorn. There was no world in which Harry and Riddle's duel would not happen last.

Harry usually watched the other duels attentively, but today he found that they failed to hold his interest. They had no importance to him. This had evolved far beyond classroom duels for the sake of practice.

Harry could not have said which order the duels went, or who won each. All he knew was that something had changed. After weeks of wishing time would slow down so that this day would never come, now he wished the duel would just start.

His wish came quickly. Cassiopeia took her seat near Riddle, who was now looking straight at him. Had she not been, he likely would not have known their duel was next, but that fact and his instincts cued him.

Harry stood without instruction and moved towards his side of the classroom. His heart was still racing and his legs really were shaking now, but his mind felt calm. A peaceful air had fallen over him now that the duel had arrived. One way or another, there would be closure. *I've never been good at waiting, but I've always been good at duelling.*

Harry wasted no time in moving once she did, correctly guessing Riddle would go on the offensive. She had played defensively against the weakest of her opponents, but any time Riddle took a duel seriously, she attacked with a storm of magic so violent that none had yet stood against it.

Harry made no attempt to shield. Elena had often complained how useless they were against a stronger opponent and that was what he faced now. None of Riddle's opponents had been able to stand against her, and he would be no different.

Instead, he moved --- moved unlike any of her opponents ever had.

The best of her opponents moved when necessary. Harry moved like the floor burned beneath his feet. He would not be an easy target. Every step was sporadic --- if Riddle found a pattern, she would set traps. *She'll find none.*

Disaster nearly befell him several times. Harry was not used to fighting someone as fast as Riddle. The truth was, Harry just wasn't swift enough. Something in his shoulder shattered moments into the duel and that same forearm was opened with a well-placed Cutting Curse that Harry had moved right into. Riddle had given him little choice. The alternative would have been to be hit with something far fouler. *She's cornering me --- she's not going to let herself waste energy by firing spells at nothing. I need to change plans.*

He lunged straight between two oncoming spells and lashed out with a volley of his own that Riddle shielded against. Harry fired off several Blasting Curses and prepared to follow up once Riddle's shield fell, but it held.

Harry's eyes widened. Never had a shield withstood so many of his spells. His eyes narrowed. This one was different, glowing with a faint, silvery light.

Riddle dropped the shield and attacked, forcing him on the back foot again. Harry fumed as he was quickly backed up towards the wall. Fighting her was like duelling three opponents at once. Soon, Harry would be overwhelmed. No, he had to stay on offence!

The students stood in a warded corner of the room, so Harry dove behind a row of abandoned desks and transfigured them into a wall of dark grey stone that stretched towards the ceiling. Harry knew it would be blown apart in seconds, but he was ready and banished the stones towards Riddle the second it happened, transfiguring half of them into a swarm of ravens and the other half into arrows as they all sailed towards her.

Harry used the projectiles to clear his own path forward. He lunged after them but felt a jolt run through him. *Bloody hell! No one's ever taken control away from me.*

It was power. Elena had once complained how ineffective she was against Harry at times simply due to how outmatched she was. All Harry had learned taught him that, in most aspects, being more magically powerful wasn't actually all that useful. There were very few spells that relied on that factor and usually, it only came into play when dealing with large-scale transfigurations.

Or something like this.

Riddle had exerted her will over his creations. *It's probably the same reason I couldn't break her shield.*

Harry conjured another wall of stone, but Riddle seemed to have expected that. She blasted it apart more violently this time, sending Harry sprawling. He avoided her follow-up volley by inches before scrambling to his feet.

The duel paused just long enough for Riddle to smile. *Damn you! It won't be that easy!*

"EXPECTO PATRONUM!"

Riddle paused at Harry's incantation. It was clever. She must have expected Harry to pull a trick similar to the one he had used against Charlus --- speaking one incantation but using another silently.

The familiar stag burst from Harry's wand and galloped towards Riddle, who stumbled. *Finally, she looks unsure.*

Harry waited until the last second before flaring the Patronus, causing it to glow so brightly that Riddle must surely be blinded.

That was when he attacked, lunging forward and unleashing a torrent of spells. Riddle's eyes were closed against the vivid light and Harry's heart leapt. This would be the moment she fell.

His mouth fell open. Riddle deflected his spells with her eyes closed. Harry's mind worked at top speed and could come only to one conclusion. She must be able to sense magic like him, but at a higher level. Her defence had not been perfect --- a Bludgeoning Curse and a Cutting Curse had gotten through.

Riddle snarled against the pain, slashing her wand with a feral look in her eye. Harry shielded just as something silver left her wand.

*BANG!*

Spasms shivered up his spine as he gasped for breath. His ears rang and white spots danced before his eyes. *Merlin, what would that spell have done had I not shielded?*

He rolled, avoiding several more spells as he roughly took to his feet. His ears rang so loudly it was like someone wailed inside his head. The room spun around him as the desks blurred and the light looked all of a sudden much too bright.

Harry snarled. He had so many tricks planned, but Riddle had just been too much. *I never had a chance.*

Hatred coursed through him. He hated her! There was no one he hated more than her! He was furious, frustrated, and hated... himself.

It was a crushing blow. His hatred for Riddle was gone. When it had vanished, he knew not, but it was gone. Voldemort had taken his parents from him, but Harry had lost his friendship with Dorea. Had he been better, this would never have happened.

*Fuck this --- fuck all of this!*

Harry lashed out just as he saw Riddle's wand move. Their two spells collided in midair and a shower of golden sparks shot up towards the ceiling. Golden light filled the room, shining as brightly as Harry's Patronus and forcing him to blink spots from his eyes. He expected Riddle to disarm him in that time, but she didn't.

Riddle's wand was occupied, as was his own. There was a brilliant ray of golden light connecting Harry's wand to Riddle's as similar rays sprung up around them, encasing them in a dome of what Harry could only describe as magic. There was a soft ambiance that sang through the room, reminding Harry of the one and only time he'd heard a phoenix sing. It filled him to the brim with fiery determination that he remembered feeling when facing a different version of Riddle down in the Chamber of Secrets.

Smaller beads of the same golden light had formed on the ray that connected Harry's wand with Riddle's, but Harry looked past them and to the girl that stood directly across from him. Her skin looked even paler in the golden light. Her eyes stood out more starkly and were wide. Gone was the calculating air in them, gone was the quiet confidence, gone was the amusement, gone even was the anger that had been there in the duel's final moments. Harry saw fear in Riddle's eyes for the first time ever and that, more than anything else that day, drove him onwards.

The beads slowly began to slide down the connected ray of light, inching closer to Riddle's wand. Harry noticed that hers began shaking whilst his remained stable, but there was a force pushing against him and he somehow knew the two of them were locked in some kind of battle. It was like their very wills had been pit against each other. *She won't win! I care too much!*

Riddle pushed and pushed, but Harry would not lose. She was stronger and more skilled, but she did not know his past. *She'll never know how much this means to me.* Riddle's composure cracked. Her lips parted and she slammed her eyes shut.

Her wand screamed when touched by a bead of golden light. Panes of glass trembled as the wail echoed through the room. It was like the whole castle would come crashing down.

Inane thoughts left him, replaced by overwhelming awareness. Silver wisps began rising from Riddle's wand and with each one, a new incantation whispered inside Harry's mind as the spell's effects played like a muggle film behind his eyes. It was Harry's turn now to smile at Riddle, who stood frozen on the other side of the room, looking for all the world as though she had seen a ghost.

Harry sensed his moment and pulled upwards with all his might. There was a heartbeat of resistance, but then, the connection shattered. The dome of light surrounding the pair of them faded all at once. The classroom suddenly looked dim without the vibrant golden light, but Harry's focus was not on that, but Riddle, who staggered so violently she nearly fell. He would never have another chance like this.

"AERIA IMPULSUM!"

*BANG!*

The floor slammed into his back again. *Where did that incantation come from? Why did I use a spell I didn't know? Fuck, it must have backfired.* Something hot nudged his hand. It burned and he jolted, vision clearing. It was a wand --- darker and longer than his own.

His heart froze as he raised his eyes.

Riddle no longer stood across from him. She laid upon the floor, her chest rising and falling, dark hair splayed across her forehead.

Harry looked from Riddle to the smoking wand lying inches from his hand. He looked up again, but the room was fading. *What just happened?*

***May 11, 1943***

***The Hospital Wing***

***9:14 PM***

Harry did not remember climbing the Astronomy Tower, but it was where he found himself. The sun had long-since set and any light hid behind a thick layer of clouds. It must have been late, for Harry could not see a single patch of torchlight at the castle's doors. Without them and the moon's silvery glow, the night was darker than pitch.

*Too dark,* Harry thought as he held a hand up before his face. *It shouldn't be so dark.*

Air froze solid in his lungs and an ache sprouted in his chest. It was like he had been stabbed by an icy dagger.

His heart froze. *Dementors.*

He whirled towards the staircase and drew his wand. He could not see the dementors, but he could feel them drawing near and hear their rattling breaths.

Anger broke through his stupor and he raised his wand. Those creatures had held terrible power over him once. They would not do it again!

"EXPECTO PATRONUM!"

His cry sliced through the night like violent thunder. The burst of silvery light shone so brightly that he raised a hand to shield his eyes. White spots danced across his vision, but he heard nothing as he waited.

Harry forced himself to look and saw that the Patronus had frozen just feet from the dementors.

*No,* Harry realized, they weren't dementors anymore.

The cold had gone and the darkness had thinned.

Harry wished it hadn't.

"No," he muttered, stumbling away from the ghosts of his past.

Sirius and Hermione stared at him through lifeless eyes. It was all too much. The tower, the dementors, the lifeless eyes; he felt like he was back there again, clutching the time turner as despair swallowed him whole.

Harry looked away, but someone else was there. Ron loomed taller now than ever before, his red hair shining like fire as his eyes blazed with hatred and fury.

"You left me!"

"No! No, Ron, I didn't---"

"She's gone and you left me. There's no one left. I thought you cared... no one cares."

The words were like a hundred bludgers slamming into his stomach one after the other. Harry grunted, eyes wide. Words formed in his mind but froze on his tongue.

Ron changed before Harry could muster any words. His nose shrank back into his face as his hair lengthened. Ron was gone, replaced by Dorea, far more intimidating from her newly found height.

"You left me!" They were the same words but these stung worse. *It's because they're true.* If Harry was stronger and moved against Riddle more aggressively, Arcturus may never have imposed his will upon Dorea.

A tiny voice in the back of his mind tried whispering that Riddle was almost definitely not the Heir of Slytherin and that she may never become the monster he'd once known, but the thoughts were forced aside by more daunting fears.

Something warm brushed against his face and, for the first time in his life, Harry hoped it was the touch of death. Anything to end this, anything to make these visions go away.

Harry gasped as his eyes flew open. He was not standing, but lying on something warm and soft. Above him loomed not the night sky, but a pale ceiling Harry thought he recognized along with the sharp scent of decontaminant.

A familiar face loomed over him and he might have drawn his wand and cursed it had that small voice's persistent whispers not been on his mind.

He began doubting that voice when memories returned --- memories of stone walls, silvery stags, and domes of golden light. Most of all, he remembered Riddle lying face-up on the classroom floor.

Any other time Riddle had lost, she struck back much harder. Her losses in the Mind Arts and the Chamber of Secrets had prompted her to corner Harry, pinning him down with an agreement he could not escape. Now he had bested her again and could only imagine what that would bring.

Bested her was really an exaggeration. Riddle had controlled every second of the duel right up to the moment their spells collided. Frustration boiled inside his stomach. *I got lucky; she had me beat.*

Not that it would matter to Riddle. She was a perfectionist and as competitive as she was brilliant. She had always been in control. Harry was proud to have changed that, but he worried what that fleeting moment of victory may cost him.

"I didn't mean to startle you," said Riddle, moving back towards a nearby bed and lowering herself back under the covers.

"It was just a dream," Harry muttered, reaching for the glass of water on his bedside table.

"It must have been quite the dream."

Harry swallowed the last of his water with a grimace. "That bad, huh?"

"You got pretty creative."

Harry frowned. "Creative?"

Riddle studied him. "Unless you can tell me where the names Ron, Sirius, and Hermione came from, then yes, I would say creative is apt."

Harry's blood ran cold. It was like the dementors had returned, but in a swarm of a hundred that no patronus could drive away.

"They were friends of mine," he hastened. "I knew them at Ilvermorny."

"Curious," Riddle said, tilting her head. "Were you using nicknames in your dream?"

"Why would I be using nicknames?"

"There were no students at Ilvermorny with the names Ron, Hermione, or Sirius. Not unless you had friends much older than you, at least. I made sure to memorize all the names in years close to yours."

Harry's heart pounded. *Shit! She must have known for months but she waited until now. Damn her! Why can't anyone else ever win!*

"You got a hold of Ilvermorny school records?" Harry asked, feigning indignance.

"Some American wizard owed Romulus's father a favour. I never asked how he convinced him to use it for this."

"That can't be legal."

"If there's a law against it, I couldn't find one. I'm sure it's frowned upon, but how can a hapless halfblood be blamed for her social blunders and societal ignorance when her summers are spent rotting away in a muggle orphanage?"

Harry almost panicked. Slughorn had secured fake records of his attendance, but what if Lestrange had seen through them? What if Riddle knew everything?

Not until he looked at her did the paranoia fade. She looked smug, but not nearly snug enough. It was like how Dudley had once looked any time Harry got in trouble for something trivial.

*What the hell am I supposed to say to that?* That her source was wrong? He could always lie and claim they were upper years like she had suggested, but all that would do was put Lestrange back on the case, and Harry thought it was best to avoid further scrutiny there. There was the time he had allegedly spent in Europe. Harry cursed when that thought occurred. That would have been a much better lie.

"Why now?" Harry asked into the deafening silence.

"I think the time for secrets is over. I've been nothing but honest with you and, earlier today, you showed me more about you than ever before. I thought peeling away another layer would be fitting."

Harry saw by the curve in her lips that Riddle was lying and not even attempting to cover it. He could call her on it and he thought she'd even admit the lie, but it served no end. The longer this conversation stretched on, the worse for him it was.

"How long have I been out?"

"Hours," she said. "There's nothing to worry about, though. Madam Violetta guessed you would be out for longer than I was. There were signs of stress and sleep deprivation."

Harry just nodded. The last thing he was about to do was admit to Riddle exactly how nervous the duel had made him.

"A note was left for you whilst you slept."

Harry's head jerked towards Riddle. "A note?" She gestured towards his bedside table. There was indeed a scroll of parchment resting beside his water glass.

Harry furrowed his brow and snatched up the note, quickly skimming it with wide eyes. "Did Madam Violetta mention when we'll be discharged?"

Riddle's lips thinned. "Her plan is to keep us for the night."

Harry winced, immense pain crashing through him at the thought of what he must do next. "I need a favour."

***Later that night...***

Harry's favour had been a usage of Riddle's perfect Disillusionment Charm, plus wards around the bed strong enough to keep the matron from noticing Harry was gone. Riddle's easy agreement had unnerved him. He had expected demands in return. He was starting to realize the thing that bothered him most about her was just how unpredictable she was.

The halls were mostly vacant by the time he slipped from the hospital wing. Harry met only a single prefect on his trek towards the large oak doors and no one else once he'd slipped out of the castle.

Harry shivered the moment he stepped outside. Not from any cold --- it was a smouldering night with heaps of humid air and very little wind --- but from the memories. The sky was the same as it had been in his dream --- the same it had been that night atop the Astronomy Tower when Harry's life had changed.

Occlumency guided his mind back on track. There was no time for foolish reminiscing about a life he could never gain back.

He descended the sloping lawns and crossed the sprawling grounds. Whilst walking it felt like time stretched on forever, but once he arrived at the forest\'s mouth, it felt like no time had passed at all.

"You really do have an excellent Disillusionment Charm."

Harry was prepared for something like that, but the sudden voice still almost made him jump. Arcturus Black flickered into being not ten-feet from him. Harry countered Riddle's Disillusionment Charm with a silent wave of his wand and felt the magic fade away until he and the Black heir looked each other up and down.

"Yours isn't bad either. You were probing with Homenum Revelio this time, weren't you?"

Black smiled. "Eyes and ears can be fooled, but not that spell."

Harry raised an eyebrow, though he wasn't sure whether or not Black could tell in the dark. "Am I not trustworthy?"

Black just stared blankly back at him. "It's not you I'm worried about. You weren't the only one in the hospital wing."

"Riddle had no reason to come in my place. I doubt you need to worry about that."

"One can never be too careful."

"I disagree." Harry emphasized the point by trying to turn up the intensity of his stare. People like Snape and Dumbledore had always been able to unnerve others with their stare alone.

"I suppose you would, wouldn't you?"

"We had a deal."

"Our deal was that I would reconsider things if you proved yourself against Riddle, not necessarily that I would revoke my word."

Harry's eyes flashed and his hand twitched longingly towards his wand. "Any new perspectives?"

"Yes, actually. I think your win was a fluke. Let me finish." Harry begrudgingly clamped his mouth shut. "I think your win was a fluke. Everything I've heard says that it was some freak accident that ended the duel. But," he continued, eyes growing more intent, "everyone also agrees you did incredibly well. Much better than I know you would have done earlier this year."

"What's your point?" Harry asked, tired of feeling as though Black was pulling him along on strings.

"My point is that, right now, I don't think you're on Riddle's level or capable of doing what you say. But I'm also not worried about Riddle right now as much as I'm worried about her two years from now."

Harry's eyes widened. "And you believe I'll be ready by then?"

Arcturus Black hesitated, but nodded. "There's no denying the gap between you two has closed this year. If you keep it up, I think you might actually be able to do what you say." Black held out a hand. "You're not ready, but you don't need to be. I'm going to back off and let Dorea do as she pleases, but if Riddle makes a move before you're ready to stop it, I maintain the right to step back in."

Harry disagreed, but he tried to hide how much it disgusted him and keep a straight face. The last thing he wanted was to undo all the good he had done, least of all as he stepped forward and shook Black's hand to seal the deal.

***Soon after...***

Harry's trek back towards the hospital wing was even quieter than the one outside. Not a single soul crossed paths with him in the halls, which was fortunate, for his Disillusionment Charm still could not match Riddle's.

Something felt off as he moved further into the castle, but it was difficult to say what. It reminded him of the feeling one got when being watched, but it was different in its own way. He wondered for a moment whether it might be a ward, but he detected none when extending his senses outwards. He frowned. Perhaps he had been imagining things, or perhaps...

The air split as Harry's ears rang with the sound of two high-pitched screams rising almost in unison from somewhere up ahead.

Harry's legs moved almost of their own accord. All pretences of subtlety vanished as his feet pounded hard against the corridor's stone floor. The sound came from near the hospital wing and it was worryingly reminiscent of the screams made by Abraxas Malfoy's victims.

*It must be him,* Harry thought as he skidded around another corner. If it turned out to be Riddle now after all this time and how thoroughly she had convinced him, he would never forgive himself.

Harry leapt around the last corner and fired a spell without looking. It sailed into the wall behind where a figure crouched over two shadowy lumps on the floor that could only be his victims.

The figure leapt back as Harry's next spell sailed over him, his hood falling. Harry snarled. Abraxas's hair shone in the torchlight like platinum fire, his grey eyes wild like raging storm clouds flecked with violent blasts of lightning. One hand was hastily shoving something --- presumably a potion vial --- into the pocket of his cloak whilst the other whipped his wand towards Harry.

"Crucio!"

Harry sidestepped, slashing his wand towards Abraxas and causing all the nearby torches to burst from their brackets and soar towards the Malfoy heir.

Abraxas swished his own wand and summoned a flock of birds around him to absorb the fire. They burst into flames and were banished towards Harry, who had expected just that. Stones rose up from the floor to block the flames before lowering back to fill the now gaping void between Harry and Abraxas.

Harry's eyes widened when the stones lowered. He had wondered for a moment why Abraxas thought that would fell him, but now he realized beating Harry had never been his plan.

A shadowy figure raced off down the corridor before Harry, who scrambled to catch up but swiftly realized it would be no good. Abraxas was taller, his strides longer. Harry's curses followed him down the corridor, but none found their mark.

Adrenaline coursed through his veins, anger boiled beneath his skin. The bastard had escaped! *There's no way a pureblood like Malfoy will be punished on the word of a halfblood.*

His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of hurried footsteps. Fleeting thoughts of Abraxas's return were crushed when he noticed the state of the corridor. *We caused too much attention --- that'll be professors.*

He dropped to the floor and cast the most powerful Disillusionment Charm he could just as two people sprinted around the corner. One was tall and thin, whilst the other was short, plump, and gasping for breath.

"Merlin's beard," came Slughorn's panting voice. "Another attack?"

"I fear so," said Dumbledore, who was now squatting down. Harry's heart raced inside his chest. Why must it have been Dumbledore? If anyone would see through his concealment, it was Dumbledore.

It took him a moment to realize what Dumbledore was so distracted by, then he remembered the victims.

A gasp came from Slughorn, looking over Dumbledore's shoulder. "A break in the pattern."

"P-pattern?" Slughorn asked.

"All the previous victims were muggleborns. Both Miss Black and Miss Fawley are purebloods. This must be a more personal attack."

Purebloods instead of muggleborns? But that made no sense. It was against everything Abraxas... wait! Miss Black and Miss Fawley?

Harry's legs gave out beneath him and suddenly, he was no longer kneeling, but sitting on the floor.

There, the two bodies rested, both hauntingly familiar, both with their eyes wide and terrified. *And right outside the hospital wing --- Abraxas might have been coming after Riddle or I.*

**Chapter 31: The Spinning of Schemes**

***May 12, 1943***

***A Secret Passage on the Third Floor***

***10:26 PM***

The past twenty-four hours still didn't feel real. Everything since his friends' bodies had been discovered felt like a nightmare, one where he moved too slowly to escape the agony chasing him.

It was like second year all over again, first with friends being attacked, and now the whispers about Hogwarts' possible closure. *Pathetic. No one cares until a pureblood's attacked, and then it's like the world is ending.*

Harry had contemplated taking things to Dippet after sneaking back into the hospital wing and reluctantly explaining what had happened to Riddle. It still felt wrong --- part of him still saw a chalk-white face and glowing red eyes any time he saw her --- but she was the only other person in the school who knew the truth. *It's a good thing I did. What a waste of time going to Dippet would have been.*

*"I may be able to talk the Headmaster around,"* Riddle had said, "*but even if I did, it wouldn't matter. A pureblood heir like Abraxas Malfoy can't just be expelled on the word of two halfbloods. We would need something more substantial; things like pensieve memories aren't valid in a court of law."*

*Riddle is my best chance of taking down Abraxas before anything else happens.* Every muscle tensed at the thought, but he knew it was true. *I have no choice; the school will close and Arcturus might reconsider our deal if this goes on much longer.*

Last night, thoughts of Dorea had left him numb and witless, but now they filled him with burning rage. Never had he hated anyone the way he loathed Abraxas. His wand had faltered in the Shrieking Shack when aimed at Sirius, but if he had the chance now... *Don't think about that. Just think about stopping him, you'll cross that bridge when it comes.*

Harry cleared his mind and stepped into the secret room. They had postponed a discussion last night because both had been too dazed. *I need to be sharp for my friends' sake --- no distractions.*

"You snuck back into the hospital wing?" Harry asked, referencing Riddle's plan from last night.

"It's like I expected. Everything about this attack is identical to the others. Black might have ingested less of the potion, but it's not a meaningful difference and won't change anything."

Harry forced his eyes shut and took a deep breath, quieting his mind again. "So we can't do anything for Dorea or Elena."

"I'm sorry."

Harry swallowed a lump in his throat. "It doesn't matter. I was prepared for that. We'll just have to focus on Malfoy. Any ideas what he might do next? I think it's pretty obvious he's still trying to frame you. You know, attacking two of my best friends a few hours after the duel."

"I think the framing has been done well enough already. If the ministry stepped in and was forced to choose the most likely candidate, I would be chosen the second any of our housemates opened their mouths."

"Maybe he doesn't want to gamble on that. Maybe he worries none of them will speak up."

Riddle waved a hand. "Can you honestly convince yourself that the likes of Nott wouldn't hand me over to the aurors?"

Harry shook his head, a bitter taste in his mouth. "If he didn't attack them to frame you, then the whole thing makes no sense. Half the school is going on about how big a mistake it was to drag in purebloods --- especially a Black."

"They're right. The ministry might be hamstrung when it comes to intervening at Hogwarts, but I doubt that will mean much. I'm not sure how much power the Wizengamot has here, but we'll find out soon. I expect action to be taken when they meet this Sunday." Riddle's expression darkened. "I won't be surprised if that action involves a closure of the school."

Harry met Riddle's eyes. A mutual understanding seemed to pass between them. *Abraxas has no idea what he's brought down on himself by threatening the only home we've ever had.*

"Okay," said Harry, "so we need to get some kind of proof. Any suggestions?"

"The most obvious and concrete answer would be his wand."

"His wand?"

"Yes. The easiest proof would be Priori Incantato." Harry raised an eyebrow. "It's a method commonly used by aurors and a lot like what happened when we duelled." A thoughtful look crossed her face. "Almost identical in some ways, but so different in others..." she trailed off, a far-away look in her eyes. Harry cleared his throat. "Sorry, I became distracted. Priori Incantato is a charm that triggers what's called the Reverse Spell Effect. It forces a wand to show the last spells it cast in reverse order."

Harry's eyes lit up. "That's easy, isn't it? All we have to do is disarm Malfoy and take his wand to Dippet! Either of us could do that. So long as it showed the Cruciatus Curse, we'd be rid of him."

"I'm not sure it's that easy," Riddle said as she twirled a lock of hair.

"Why not?"

"Because there are limits on Priori Incantato. It depends on the power and will of the caster, plus the wand's composition. It won't just show every spell the wand has ever cast; it will only go back so far."

Harry deflated. "So we have to catch him right in the middle of an attack or something, don't we?"

Something flashed in Riddle's eyes; annoyance, frustration, impatience --- it was impossible to tell. "That's probably our safest option, yes."

*It's like she has a better idea she isn't sharing, but something feels wrong*. He decided it was best to move on. "That makes things harder. His attacks all seem random."

Riddle studied him. "What would you say if I told you I don't think he planned to attack either of your friends?"

"That's crazy."

"Is it?" Riddle asked, a single eyebrow raised. "Is it so hard to believe the two of them were coming to see you and just got caught up in the way?"

"Caught up in the way of what?"

"The tying of loose ends." When Harry stayed still, Riddle went on. "If Malfoy's victims ever wake up, they'll be able to tell anyone who listens exactly what happened. Even if he has graduated by then, this is the sort of scheme that would land him in Azkaban."

Harry's eyes widened. "You think he was trying to silence his victims?"

"I think he was trying to silence them whilst I was in the wing. He probably thought I was asleep and realized he could kill two birds with one stone --- silencing his victims whilst painting the blame even brighter on me."

"You actually look impressed," Harry said, scowling.

Riddle shrugged. "I can appreciate a well-thought plan."

"So you think he'll return to the hospital wing, then?"

Riddle smiled without mirth. "Under the right set of circumstances, I'm sure he will."

***Soon after, in the Chamber of Secrets...***

Harry slunk down to the chamber soon after parting from Riddle, ranting about the last day's affairs to Cerastes, who slithered in restless circles. *He has more energy than usual.*

**"So the usurper believes if she puts herself in the infirmary again, she can draw out another strike from this new pretender?"**

**"That's what she said, yes."**

**"I disagree."**

If the mood was less grim, Harry might have smirked. **"You always disagree with the usurper."**

**"It is more than that. This new pretender's strength seems to lie in planning."**

Harry considered that. **"I guess it does,"** he admitted. **"Malfoy's solid with a wand, but there are better in his year."**

**"Cunning is the great equalizer,"** Cerastes preached.

Harry would have dismissed that once, but not now. Just the faintest bit of cunning this year had gotten him far. It had helped him hold together relationships whilst infiltrating Riddle's group and given him opportunities he would never have had without it. If someone like Abraxas used the same kind of cunning without any morality attached, Harry could imagine why that might be so dangerous.

**"So you don't think he'll attack the hospital wing again?"**

Cerastes's rustling intensified. **"If that is his plan, he will, but not in the way he already failed. He will attack differently and under less predictable circumstances. The usurper's plan will fail."**

*He's right, Riddle is underestimating Abraxas just like she did me back in the fall.* Frustration boiled beneath his skin. **"We have to try it,"** Harry hissed back.

**"Why?"** Cerastes asked, sounding frustrated.

Harry wrung his hands. **"Because without it, we have no hope of catching him in the act."**

There was a pause, then Cerastes hissed more slowly than usual. **"Allow me to propose a solution."**

***May 14, 1943***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***9:44 PM***

Harry grunted when his wand flew high, spinning towards Charlus. *I've never been so frustrated while duelling.* Back when he often lost to Charlus, it had been expected. *Not now; I should be winning, but my head's too scrambled.* Embarrassment burned and heat rose to his cheeks. *How am I supposed to stop Abraxas if I can't even focus long enough to duel Charlus?*

"Let's call it," Charlus said from across the room, tossing Harry back his wand.

"Sorry," Harry muttered, leaning against the wall. "I'm just... distracted."

Charlus came closer, frowning. "Mate, I get it. I was surprised you agreed to come at all tonight and I wouldn't have blamed you if you hadn't." Harry nodded, unsure how to respond. Charlus rested a hand on his shoulder. "It'll all work itself out," he promised. "They'll wake up and be able to say exactly who did it. The bastard won't get away with it, whoever they are."

Harry yearned to tell Charlus the truth. *I've never hated secrets so much, but I can't tell him. He'd go straight to Dippet or try and solve it himself; it's what I would have done before this year.* "I just hope it gets sorted out in time."

Charlus winced. "You've heard the rumours too?"

"Rumours?" Harry asked. "I'm not sure it's a rumour. If you were Lord Black or Fawley, would you let this go?"

"I might." Harry opened his mouth, but Charlus raised a hand. "Listen, I get that the safest thing to do is to close the school. That's obvious and makes sense. But if the school closes, whoever the hell's behind this could be out of Britain by the time the victims wake up and explain what happened."

Harry had never considered that. "Can the ministry not persecute them if they're not in Britain? I've heard the muggles have some sort of treaty for that."

Charlus shrugged. "It depends where they went. They could try, but the chances of them actually getting it done would be a lot slimmer."

Harry clenched his fists, not even flinching at the way his nails bit painfully into his palms. "I hate it!"

Charlus nodded. "I know. Trust me, I know."

*He probably does.* Might this be how Charlus felt wishing justice upon whoever killed his mother? Harry had at least always known how his own parents had died and exactly who to blame, but Charlus had never been given that small degree of mercy.

"How do you deal with it?" he asked.

Charlus's smile carried a new edge. "You plan to do something about it and hold onto that hope like you're dangling from a broom a hundred feet off the ground."

Harry nodded as the two boys stood in silence. *We really do think alike... Merlin, why does my family have such bad luck?*

***Soon after...***

Harry refocused on Occlumency once he'd parted from Charlus. *Damn him for being so likeable, I had my mind under control*. He remembered the wand spinning from his hand and grimaced.

It was all just overwhelming. *How have things gotten worse since I eliminated Riddle as a suspect? She was supposed to be the hard part.*

Harry's step faltered. Something had moved from the corner of his eye, or so he thought. He looked around but saw nothing. *It's like I can feel a ward just up ahead, but it's not really a ward. Merlin, I'm losing it.*

Things were getting out of hand. Fearing Riddle was one thing, but now he was leaping at nothing. *Great,* he thought, imagining Draco's smug face, *a Malfoy has made me fear my own shadow.*

The ward-like sensation vanished and the hairs on his neck stood on end. Harry threw himself forward and to the floor, trusting in his instincts and hoping he had not just made an utter fool of himself.

"CRUCIO!"

The curse flew just over his head. *Bloody hell, that would have hit me if I hadn't moved.*

Three figures stood up ahead. *That feeling must have meant a Disillusionment Charm.* The one in the lead was easily recognizable by his bright blond hair, flanked on both sides by boys much taller and broader. *Does he think that will scare me?*

Harry opened fire on Abraxas. The Malfoy heir was prepared this time and took a page from Harry's book --- banishing the hall's torches towards him with a long sweep of his wand. Malfoy gasped, red tendrils spreading out from a cut beneath his arm. His wand movements were wider and slower than Harry's, which gave him time to sneak spells through his guard while the older boy cast.

Harry turned his attention to the torches. They changed shape, now burning arrows sailing back towards the trio.

One of them yelped and lunged sideways to avoid several of the arrows, and that was when Harry saw his face. It was like the Goyle of his own time had travelled back with him for how much they resembled each other, though this boy was much larger. *Let's hope he's as useless as his son, even if he is older.*

The hem of the third boy's robe burst alight and his howls filled the corridor. Harry spared him only a glance --- recognizing him as a sixth-year boy named Aiden Burke --- before turning his attention back to Abraxas. Malfoy's robes were singed, but he had avoided the worst of Harry's volley and was now back on offence.

They exchanged spells back and forth for what felt like minutes but what was hardly seconds. Malfoy was good with this kind of magic. The duel was more competitive now that Harry wasn't using Transfiguration, but he couldn't; Malfoy was doing an excellent job of pelting him with spells, not giving him the time required for anything intricate. Harry slowly advanced, but whatever ground he gained, he lost when Goyle fired potshots from over Malfoy's shoulder.

Harry's eyes narrowed. Burke was crawling away down the corridor, cloaked in the sweet scent of burning flesh. *That's him out, but it still leaves Goyle to deal with before I can disarm and turn in Malfoy*.

Harry tried sneaking around Malfoy to get a shot at Goyle, but the brute did well keeping Malfoy between them. *That's surprisingly clever of them. This way, Goyle can attack the whole time while Malfoy handles most of the duel. They're trying to keep me on defence and wait for me to tire.* It would work if this duel lasted long enough. *Fine, time to end this.*

"CRUCIO!"

Malfoy lunged aside, wide-eyed, leaving Goyle alone. He slumped to the floor, struck by the Stunner Harry had masked. *Just the two of us now, Malfoy.*

"AVADA KEDAVRA!"

*Fuck!* Harry dove sideways and heard the wall explode behind him. Green flames spewed across the corridor. Harry tried seizing control of the fire but had no success. *It's not even that it resists, it's that I can't get a hold of it in the first place.* His heart thundered in his ears. *I guess there's no controlling death.*

Harry scrambled up and drove Abraxas back with a barrage of curses. The stones beneath the fire lifted and hurled themselves at Abraxas, who just barely dodged. Malfoy screamed, stumbled and bloodied by burning bits of shrapnel, rushing off in the direction Burke had crawled.

Harry made to follow but felt his senses flare and leapt aside, avoiding a silent curse he had never seen before. He whirled, but all he saw was a tall shadow running down the corridor.

Harry spun back 'round, but Malfoy was already out of range and in full flight, leaving a trail of crimson droplets in his wake.

Rage welled up but he forced it down, remembering Cerastes's plan. "You should have killed me, Malfoy," he whispered aloud. "You'll wish you had soon."

**Chapter 32: Best Laid Plans**

***May 14, 1943***

***The Dungeons***

***10:13 PM***

Emily Riddle had learned that suffering bitter defeat was a much easier pill to swallow when she was just days away from winning a much grander victory.

The duel still soured her mood, but it was naught but a footnote. Tonight was all that mattered --- tonight she would have everything she had wanted for a year and begin the long path to forging a better world.

It should not have taken half so long as it had. The plan was perfect and she had been so sure it would all go off without a hitch.

Until Hadrian Pavonis had shown up at Hogwarts and thrown everything into disarray. Emily had always been a cut above, but Pavonis made her nervous. First he had found the chamber faster than her, then he had shrugged off her Legilimency attack, and finally he had won the duel. *No, you lost the duel because of a magical anomaly. That isn't the same as Pavonis winning. No one here is on your level.*

*But the duel is only a part of it.* Patterns were patterns. She had always seen patterns others missed, always observed things no one else had noticed. There were too many patterns involving Pavonis that twisted themselves in circles and led to no logical conclusion. It vexed her more than losing the duel, almost more than the delaying of her plans.

*I should loathe him.* But she didn't. Pavonis wasn't like the others. Men like Dumbledore hung onto their loathing like a lifeline, but Pavonis had seen reason. Pavonis treated her differently. He *was* different, she just didn't know why. The more Emily thought about him, the more she...

Emily cleared her mind. *Why am I nervous? The plan is perfect. See it through and worry about Pavonis and your feelings when he is all but yours.* Any lingering doubts he had would shatter tonight when he learned the truth. Her stomach twisted into anxious knots even as she thought it. Most would not understand. *He will. He's not like the others.*

Emily refocused on the corridor ahead. It was so deep in the dungeons that torches no longer hung along the walls. A glowing sphere of magic drifted behind her, floating through the blackness like a distant lighthouse in the middle of a dark, open sea.

*Another annoyance.* Being forced to trudge through unknown corridors was an insult, a reminder how long overdue this meeting was.

Always she had imagined this day would unfold on her terms, but it was not to be. *Everything will be worth it; it's all part of the plan.*

Up ahead, the corridor ended in a sheer face of stone, forking off in two diagonal halls leading in opposite directions. Emily stopped just short of the fork and waited, her heart racing. *Why does it suddenly feel so cold?*

**"You have come?"** a voice hissed from behind the stones.

Emily made herself smile and took great care to sound as confident as she could. **"Of course. This has all been my plan since the beginning."**

***Soon after, in the Chamber of Secrets...***

Adrenaline still coursed through Harry's veins despite the fact that the skirmish had ended. Harry had spent some time just standing in that corridor, surrounded by billowing dust from the broken wall.

It had all felt so natural at the time. Harry really had pushed himself hard this year. Every exchange had felt like second nature. Harry moved without thinking and cast without doubt even when faced with the worst magic had to offer.

That thought made him shudder.

The Unforgivable Curses.

Harry had fought against the Unforgivable Curses and won. He remembered how disturbing it had been seeing that sickening green light back in September.

*So much has changed.*

Harry's musings had not lasted long. *If Abraxas is trying attacks like that, it means he's desperate.* It excited and unnerved him all at once. *It means we're close, but he's probably even more dangerous now.* That was when he thought of Dorea and Elena, lying prone in the hospital wing where Abraxas had already tried attacking once.

*Oh, Merlin...*

He ran faster than he had ever run before. Torches flashed by, a thousand orange blurs as he sprinted around corners and flew down long, open corridors. It was like fleeing the library in first year all over again --- he never felt his feet hit the floor, nor did he consider how fast his heart was beating, or even where he was.

Harry burst into the hospital wing, panting and exhausted. Disillusioned, he crept toward and peeled back his friends' curtains. There they lay, alive but unmoving, their chests still rising with each and every breath. *We need to stop Abraxas before that changes.* Harry's hand gripped Elena's so tight his knuckles turned white. *I won't lose anyone else, not after last year.*

It took mere minutes to reach the Chamber of Secrets, but it felt like hours. It was like moving through a dream, never fast enough to escape the horrors behind you.

**"Cerastes!"** Harry called when the statue's jaw unhinged. **"CERASTES!"**

**"I am here,"** the basilisk hissed, falling to the chamber floor with a thump. **"What is it?"**

**"The newest pretender attacked me tonight with two of his friends. They meant to kill me. He's become desperate; he knows it's Azkaban if he's caught."**

**"Good."**

**"Good?"** Harry hissed back. **"What do you mean 'good'? Do you understand what this means?"**

**"That the time for action has come."**

**"Yes, but he's probably thinking the same thing. My friends are still petrified in the hospital wing. The pretender will make his move tonight, and if we're not fast enough to stop it..."**

**"It will be stopped."**

*Easy to be confident when you're a sixty-foot killing machine whose friends\' lives aren't on the line.* **"I hope so. Reckless means dangerous."**

**"And dangerous means vulnerable. The best way to thwart danger is not to hide in the shadows --- it is to strike so fiercely the threat is removed."**

*He really does think like a predator.* Harry was slowly coming to think the same way. Defence meant only stalemates more often than not --- sometimes, initiative was needed.

**"Time to move, then?"** Harry asked, recalling the plan they'd hatched days earlier.

Harry knew Cerastes wanted something bolder. The basilisk would have killed Abraxas if he had his way and, for a heartbeat, Harry considered it. **"Yes,"** Cerastes hissed, **"at last, it is time."**

***Minutes later, in the Slytherin dorms...***

Abraxas trembled as if wracked by cold. His eyes stung and his face felt swollen. His knees grew weak, almost buckling beneath the weight of it all.

Tonight was it. Abraxas had made one last desperate strike against Pavonis, but it had failed.

*How is he so fucking good?*

Abraxas had never seen anything like it before. A fourteen-year-old boy defending against Unforgivable Curses as if they were nothing more than Stunners? A fourteen-year-old boy defeating all three of them as if it was nothing? A fourteen-year-old boy single-handedly foiling the best-laid plans?

It was ridiculous. That was the sort of plot written about in children's books, but Abraxas was watching it unfold right before his eyes. Or, he supposed, fold around him. It drove the air from his lungs and the will from his heart as he realized how inevitable his fate now was.

All they had to do was check his wand. They would find not one, but two Unforgivable Curses. Then there was the hall, so clearly blown apart by the Killing Curse. *How much else does he know? Has he figured out the Draught of Living Death? Does he know the real reason I was near the hospital wing the first night we duelled?*

Azkaban awaited him regardless, but Abraxas hoped he didn't know. Just thinking about that boy made his skin crawl. *Let him take me quietly; spare me this one, last mercy.* The cell awaiting him was bad enough. Abraxas had no need for further torment.

Just knowing his family would end with him was bad enough. *Maybe Father could sire one more son with a younger wife, but Mother would need to... what am I thinking?*

Why was he pondering his mother being murdered by his father? *The better question is why I don't feel sick just thinking it.*

*I'm broken... fuck them all!* It was all their fault. His father had been the one to push him down this path. Reports of Riddle's prowess scared him and the way she had dismissed the purity of blood scared him worse. *"You don't understand how threatening that is,"* his father had said. *"People like her change the world, Abraxas. What changes do you think that mudblood will make?"*

Wanting to save their society was noble, but why did it have to be him? Why was an eighteen-year-old boy expected to fix everything?

*Everything is so unfair!* Why was his life on the brink of ruin all for doing the right thing? Why was his life unravelling all because he tried to save their kind? *None of this is fair!*

Abraxas took a shaky breath and stared out the porthole in his dormitory. There was nothing beyond it but blackness, hidden depths every bit as bleak as his future.

There was something he could do, but was it worth it? Did his father deserve a second chance after throwing his son and heir away? Did Abraxas even want his father to succeed anymore?

He bit down so hard on his lip that a coppery tang filled his mouth. Blood unnerved some. His lip stung, but it cleared his mind tonight. A thin stream of crimson rolled down his lip and dribbled onto his chin.

*It's not about Father, it's bigger than him.* His father could burn in the worst of hells and Riddle was a jumped-up mudblood with delusions of grandeur.

But Pavonis...

There was something different about him. Riddle was talented, but she wielded that talent like a brat showing off her toy. Pavonis... Abraxas shuddered. Something had lurked behind those eyes like a great, dark beast. It had been coiled there unwillingly, but one day it would strike.

*If anything can break the world, it's whatever that is.*

Hadrian Pavonis was dangerous --- perhaps the greatest threat Britain had faced since Emeric the Evil. If his father perished at the boy's hands, so be it, but Abraxas would not condemn their world or their culture. They would know what was coming --- that was all he could give them now.

Abraxas raised his wand to summon some parchment, but a sound from behind him chilled his blood. He had heard the dorm room's entrance open thousands of times, but this once, it unnerved him. Edward and the others knew not to disturb him and there had been layers of wards upon that door.

That meant...

*Fuck!*

Abraxas whirled to face the aurors, but they were not there. In their place was a tall girl with pale skin and dark hair whose eyes burned... burned with something akin to what Abraxas had seen whilst duelling Pavonis.

*Wrong again,* he mused just as Riddle raised her wand.

"Imperio!"

***Back in the Chamber of Secrets...***

Waiting was agony.

Harry would rather have been hit with the Cruciatus Curse than waited another moment in that blasted chamber!

His wand twirled around his fingers as he paced back and forth. What was taking Cerastes so long? How difficult was it to scare the daylight out of Malfoy and lead him towards the girls' bathroom? Why in Merlin's name was Harry kept waiting for so long? At this rate, he ought to have just done the thing himself. Did Cerastes have no---

**"It is done."**

Harry looked wildly around before mentally chastising himself and slamming his eyes shut. *Stupid!* He was far too emotional. Simple mistakes like that could kill him. A single slip up in the bathroom and Harry could join his parents and everyone else who vanished in that cursed green light.

Harry was glad Cerastes was nowhere in sight --- Harry would be dead had he been --- but where was he? Close enough to be heard but nowhere in sight? *Did he just hiss down the pipe when he got to the bathroom?* That must be it. *He realizes I'm stressed and in a hurry.* Guilt gnawed at him. *I was just cursing him out a minute ago... stupid.*

Harry crushed those thoughts. Guilt was unhelpful right now and he could not afford mistakes.

His heart pounded in his ears as he ascended up towards the bathroom. What did 'it is done' mean? It was oddly final. Did that mean Abraxas was already in the bathroom? How did Cerastes know he would remain there? Or did it just mean the task was done? How close was he if that was true? How much time would Harry have?

He burst out into the bathroom and conjured a wall of stone, crouching behind it. Water dripped from a nearby tap, splashing against the bright, marble sink. All else was still.

Harry cast a wordless Homenum Revelio that came up empty. *No Abraxas yet; good.* There was still time to plan an ambush. Confidence filled him for the first time all night. All he had to do was disarm him --- then he could take his wand to Dippet and, once shown the site of their last duel, the old man would have no choice but to...

Something moved on the other side of Harry's stone wall and he froze. *That's impossible*. The Homenum Revelio Charm had never been wrong!

Harry waited but heard no other sounds. "Who's there!" he asked. Again, he waited. Again, no one answered.

*Fuck it!*

Harry vanished his wall of stone and lunged forward, spinning on his heel with his wand raised and ready to strike.

His heart stopped beating. A dark shape loomed against the room's back wall, coiled so tightly it was hard to tell one part of the snake from the others. Cerastes barely fit in the bathroom --- why the hell was he here in the first place --- but his head was turned *towards* Harry, who wouldn't have enough time to close his eyes. *Fuck... I'm dead...*

The basilisk's eyes were closed. Harry's shoulders shook, struck by a crazed urge to laugh. He crushed it. **"How long?"**

Cerastes cocked his head. **"Long?"**

**"Yes, long! How long until Malfoy gets here?"** Cerastes lay motionless against the wall, unanswering. **"CERASTES---"**

**"Behind you."**

Harry whirled, fearing that Malfoy had somehow fooled his charm and found some hidden passageway into the room.

"What... what the fuck?"

Abraxas Malfoy laid face up upon the bathroom floor. His robes were as pristine as ever, his hair splayed around him. Yet his eyes were different. The storm behind them had been quelled and now, they looked unseeingly up towards the ceiling, all life snuffed out from them... all life snuffed out by the snake who loomed behind him...

**Harry Potter and the Conjoining of Paragons**

**By ACI100**

**Chapter 33: Broken Puzzles**

***May 14, 1943***

***The Dungeons***

***11:04 PM***

Emily resisted yet another flinch. She waited in a dungeon corridor near the Slytherin common room that was decorated with serpent effigies. Every now and then, the torchlight reflected strangely off of one to give the impression of movement. Emily had thought several times whilst waiting that something was sneaking up on her after mistakenly spotting something from the corner of her eye.

*Don't be foolish.*

There was no reason to worry. Everything was well in hand.

Emily had begun believing her cause was lost soon after the chamber was sealed against her. Her plan hinged on its opening. She had once been unwilling to believe Pavonis was the Heir of Slytherin, but the longer she spent around him, the clearer it became. Her failed attempt at Legilimency had been the nail in the coffin. *He's special, no one repels me that way.*

Never had she wanted to curse anyone so badly, yet there was something else as well; dormant at first, but more and more restless as time raced by. The first flashes were easy to ignore, but that changed fast. The lightness in her stomach when the two stood near, the way she relaxed any time he was around, how easily her smiles came around him....

*Stay composed. You can pursue that venture soon. He'll understand; he has to understand.*

Hope had returned when she began hearing a disembodied voice while patrolling the hall. It had scared her at first. If Pavonis was so uneasy around her, surely his monster was on the prowl. Months passed and still no attack came. Emily began wondering. *I've misread something, but how badly?*

Curiosity had always been a weakness of hers. It was what led her down Malfoy's trail --- and what a happy coincidence that had been --- and it was what pulled her close to Pavonis. A night not long ago, it was what led her down into the bowels of the castle, aware she may be walking into Pavonis's trap. *I need to try. I can't pass up the smallest chance, I would never forgive myself.*

Emily's knuckles had been white on her wand as she crept down the tunnel and back towards the Chamber of Secrets. *Kill it at the first sign of aggression.* It was a good plan, but doubt lingered. This was no duel --- she knew that Fiendfyre or the Killing Curse could destroy a basilisk, but both came with a caveat. *Can I cast faster than it can look at me?*

Her worries had been for naught. The statue's mouth opened this time and the basilisk slithered forth. Emily raised her wand and steeled her nerves, but the snake only hissed to her.

***"A usurper has deceived me. His tales were sweet, but his nature betrays him. A worthy master would not let another oppose him for so long."***

The rush had been incredible. Never had victory tasted so sweet. *To think I almost gave up...* It was a ridiculous thought. *Why did I doubt myself?* She had smiled then, victorious just as she always was. *And now my plan is possible, it just needs some unexpected work.*

Step one had completed itself as she waited in that dungeon corridor. She knew it the second her connection to Abraxas Malfoy faded. He was a competent wizard, but no match for her will or her magic. He could not have beaten her Imperius Curse, which meant the job was done.

Emily strode back up into the castle and towards the marble staircase. Her footsteps echoed in the quiet of night, all other sounds swallowed by the gaping darkness around her, punctured only by softly blazing torches and the occasional pool of silver where moonlight bled through a large glass window.

Brief disappointment flared when she stepped into the bathroom. *A pity. I hoped to see the body.* No blood soaked the tiled floor, but of course, that was natural. *The king of serpents needs only a stare to kill.* The thought brought a smile to her lips. *I couldn't ask for a better inheritance.*

**"Open."**

Her trek towards the chamber felt like it lasted forever. Never had she imagined this walk could feel longer than it had on Samhain, but tonight was worse. *The wait is worth it... everything will be worth it. The world will one day thank me.*

The doors finally appeared up ahead and Emily could not help but smile. Not one of the reserved expressions she showed at will, but a true smile. Victory was hers. She revelled, drinking in every inch of stone, watching the way dim torchlight made the carvings appear to slither around each other as they waited on her call.

**"Open."** Emily strolled across the threshold, a bright smile on her lips and excitement coursing through her veins until she looked up and froze.

Her heart stilled and her blood ran cold. It was like the morning when Mrs. Cole had confronted her over Dennis and Amy's condition. She had been so sure all had gone smoothly, but when confronted, she felt as though everything was just a hand's width from being stripped away.

This was worse --- a crushing defeat worse than anything she had ever known.

Abraxas Malfoy sprawled lifelessly before her, but he was merely a footnote, an important part of a plan now dead.

Hadrian Pavonis stood in the chamber's centre, surrounded by a protective circle of poisonous green scales. His face was expressionless, but his green eyes glowed with a cold fury as he looked up at her. She shuddered. *I've been tricked!*

**"Evening, Riddle."** The basilisk's head came up, its eyes closed. Each fang was nearly the length of her arm and all of them were bared, dripping green poison that sizzled against the ancient stone floor. *I'm dead, it really was a trap. This can't be happening; I always win!* **"I think we have some talking to do."**

***"Be commanding!"*** Cerastes had ordered. ***"Your equals will never respect you otherwise."***

His equals...

The thought left a bitter taste in Harry's mouth. Against his will, a different Riddle's words welled up from a different time.

*"There are strange likenesses between us, after all. Even you must have noticed. Both halfbloods, orphans, raised by Muggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself. We even look something alike..."*

Those words had haunted him ever since Tom Riddle had spoken them, but the Chamber of Secrets had offered him solace. He had not followed Riddle's path, but beaten her down it. She was not the Heir of Slytherin here and he was no pretender. It was him who commanded Slytherin's legacy and it was she who wished to usurp it. They were so different that Cerastes obeyed him whilst calling her nothing but a usurper.

That was how it had been when times were simpler. *I have a feeling things are about to get a lot more complicated.*

**"You!"** Riddle bellowed at Cerastes. **"You betrayed me!"**

**"I did no such thing."**

**"You---"**

**"Never once promised what would happen after aiding you with the part of your plan I agreed with. I owe you nothing. What happened tonight was best for you."**

**"Best for me?"** Riddle demanded. Her eyes were wide and wild. It was the most unhinged Harry had ever seen her. **"How is being betrayed by my birthright best for me?"**

**"I did not betray you!"** Anger hung in the snake's rebuke, but Riddle did not flinch. *She might be braver than I am.*

**"Yet you stand with a boy who pronounced me guilty without a trial."**

**"I stand with one of two heirs --- the one who was successful in finding me first. First impressions are important, Emily Riddle."**

Riddle rounded on him. **"What have I ever done to you?"** she hissed, still speaking Parseltongue. Harry jolted. Tears rippled in those dark blue eyes. **"We worked together---"**

**"No,"** Harry argued, crushing the irrational sympathy that welled up. **"You abandoned our plan and killed Malfoy."**

Riddle stuck her chin out. **"Did he not deserve it? If someone ruined your life, would you not want them dead?"**

Harry grasped for a rebuke. Ice trickled through his veins. *This shouldn't be hard. I shouldn't agree with murder.* But there was no rebuke; Abraxas would have killed his friends and others had the chance arose. *Maybe Tom Riddle was right... maybe there's more in common than I realized.*

Voldemort's face swam through Harry's mind, his eyes tinting the chamber crimson as Harry stared through them and towards Riddle. *Focus on the other part of her argument. Fight against what you can.* **"Ruined your life? His frame job wasn't even successful."**

**"His frame job is a small part of a larger puzzle."**

**"What puzzle?"** Harry hissed, his pulse quickening. **"You're---"**

**"Right."**

Harry's head snapped up. **"What?"** he hissed at Cerastes, heart now racing. *This can't be happening.*

The snake flicked its tongue. **"Do you think I would have aided her had I not agreed with what I helped accomplish?"**

**"But why?"** Harry raged, hand curled so tightly around his wand that his nails bit painfully into his palms.

Emily straightened up, looking more confident now. **"Because so long as people like Malfoy are in power, people like us will never get what we deserve."**

**"Enough games!"** Harry demanded, finally pushed past his breaking point. **"Stop telling me what you think I want to hear!"**

Something dangerous lurked behind Riddle's eyes. It was a dark shadow that made the blue of her iris appear almost black. She took a step forward despite the basilisk between them. Harry almost stepped back. *No,* he thought, remembering the advice Cerastes had given. *Be commanding; no weakness.*

**"What I think you want to hear?"** She looked livid. **"I have planned this all since long before I knew you. I dreamt of a world where we could succeed long before the war began."** Her eyes smouldered. **"And I have never once told you what you want to hear. Think, Pavonis, think of all the times we've spoken. Think of how I treat you differently."**

Guilt twisted inside his stomach. *She's right... why does she have to be right? Why can't she just try and kill me? Things were so much easier when Voldemort just tried killing me.*

**"She is telling the truth,"** Cerastes hissed, echoing his thoughts. *I have a feeling he means the other half.*

But it made no sense! Voldemort had championed blood purity --- he had fought a decade-long war for the cause. This was impossible, there was no way it could...

Ice crept through Harry's veins as he remembered a night in the Slytherin common room when dozens of serpents had come to life and Emily Riddle had shown a group of purebloods exactly what real power was.

This couldn't be happening, but it was. Cerastes was incapable of humour and subtlety had never been his way.

*Fuck me, she's being serious... she's really doing all of this to try and fight blood supremacy, but how?*

**"What does Malfoy have to do with any of this? He was a student! You've gone and made a mess of everything all because of a few stupid customs!"**

**"Customs that will destroy our world if left unchecked."** Riddle glared so fiercely that he nearly stepped back again. *Be commanding!* But how could he be commanding while Riddle tore away everything he'd thought was truth? **"I sat with my head down and listened to one world crumble as it shook all around me. I'm not going to watch another be ruined by bigoted fools!"**

**"Malfoy---"**

**"Is the heir to one of the most important champions of the cause that will destroy us."**

**"What point does this prove? All it does is make their case stronger!"**

A cold smile crept onto Riddle's lips. **"Not when the aurors check his wand and we tell them what he did. Who can blame a poor, innocent halfblood raised by muggles for defending herself against the rampaging Heir of Slytherin --- a boy who killed children for his cause, a symbol of just how dangerous extremists like him are?"**

Numb shock gripped him in an embrace tighter than death's. His mouth fell open and his mind slowed, then raced again. *Merlin... her plan... it could actually work.* The world spun around him, a complex puzzle with its pieces shifting, fitting back together in a completely new pattern. *Everything I knew about her was wrong... I was wrong about all of it.*

**Author's Endnote:**

**And that, my friends, is the end of CoP year 1.**

**I expect this chapter to be divisive, but that is largely its purpose.**

**There will be a two-month time skip between this and chapter 34. I'm aware this may seem like an odd choice, but trust me, writing the next two months in detail would really hurt the pacing. I think you'll see what I mean soon :)**

**Here's to another great year ahead!**

**Harry Potter and the Conjoining of Paragons**

**By ACI100**

**Chapter 34: Awakenings**

***July 11, 1943\
Knockturn Alley\
7:52 PM***

Raindrops pattered against damp pavement like hurried footsteps. Harry had cut through a patch of grass not long ago and his socks now squished beneath his feet. The hem of his robes skimmed the surface of a puddle as he turned down another dark alleyway. Ripples spread across the small pool of water as Harry continued on, stopping beside a bin and gingerly removing that day's edition of the *Daily Prophet.*

***GRINDELWALD SUPPORTERS NARROWLY ESCAPE JUSTICE AND FLEE TO ITALY!***

"A worrying headline."

Harry turned, clearing his mind as he raised an eyebrow. "I thought we were meeting near Borgin and Burkes."

"That was the plan, yes."

"You didn't have to come and find me. I was on my way."

"I'm aware," said Emily, her lips curving up.

"But you're here anyway?"

The smile fell from her lips. "I've never been patient and I sensed you nearby. I wasn't going to stand there and wait."

Harry's eye twitched. *Sensed me nearby? How good is her Legilimency?* There was little to do. *She's impossible when she gets like this; there's no convincing her otherwise.* That was something he had learned these past two months.

*Two months already? Merlin, time goes fast.*

Now that Harry wasn't so caught up in the moment, he could appreciate how brilliant a play Cerastes had made. Removing their largest threat, pulling aside the veil through which he saw Emily, and uniting the pair of them in a single stroke had been a masterclass.

Warring emotions raged inside him, even now.

Abraxas Malfoy was dead and the pair of them had got off scot-free. There had been an investigation conducted both by aurors and professors, but there was nothing to find sans Abraxas's wand. Once a Priori Incantato yielded the Unforgivable Curses, it was a cut and dry case.

The shock of that night lingered, and still there were nights he awoke from visions of Abraxas's body lying on the bathroom floor, staring up at him through lifeless eyes.

When most of the shock passed, Harry could not help but feel lighter than he had in months. *Emily really isn't going to become Voldemort...*

She was ruthless and manipulative, but Harry could not imagine her starting a war pursuing the purity of blood --- not when her entire plan had been to use Abraxas as a pawn against the pureblood movement. *It was almost noble in a weird, twisted way...*

Those thoughts were odd and always left him feeling jittery. What was he to do now? The past year had been spent ensuring Voldemort never rose here.

*I guess I'll just keep watching her. She's still not a good person. Just because she isn't Voldemort doesn't mean she can't do awful things.* Harry had to remember that. It was easy talking to her now that the worst of his fears were gone, easy falling into their friendly patterns since that night in the chamber. *If someone would have told me a year ago I'd be friends with Riddle, I'd have laughed in their face...*

Abraxas's face swam up through his thoughts, but he tried ignoring it. *He had to die; he would have killed my friends.*

"It still bothers you, doesn't it?"

Emily was studying him and Harry realized then how long the silence had stretched. Hairs rose on the back of his neck. *How does she always know what I'm thinking?* "You're sure you don't constantly legilimize me?"

Emily rolled her eyes. "We've been over this already. I have a hard time not gleaning people's basic emotions, but I don't need Legilimency to know what you're thinking."

*That's not creepy at all...* "It's not the way you think," he said, sighing. "Abraxas dying isn't what bothers me, it's the fact I feel like I should be bothered."

A shadow crossed her face. "Should you mourn for someone who tortured your best friends?"

"I don't mourn him, I---"

"You're far too good a person. Abraxas deserved everything he got and you know it. He would have killed them all."

Harry grimaced, but nodded. "I know, but that doesn't mean I have to like it."

"Don't worry," she said, grinning, a gleam in her eye. "I'll leave you out of any future murders."

A small shiver ran up his spine. *Why does she have to make quips like that? I'm never sure if she's serious.* There was a surety she spoke with that made it hard to tell. *It's like she knows anything she says will come true.*

"Cheers," he muttered, unsure how to answer. "What did you mean earlier?"

Emily frowned. "About what?"

"You said the paper was worrying. It looked like a decent enough headline to me."

Emily pursed her lips. "What do you think that headline meant?"

Harry ran a hand through his hair. "It means that Grindelwald is losing, doesn't it?"

"And you remember the conversation we had after Grindelwald's failed offensive in Stalingrad?"

A fist of ice closed in Harry's stomach. "You think it means he's going to come to Britain?"

"Grindelwald doesn't handle losing well."

Harry raised an eyebrow, heart thundering in his chest. *She's not Voldemort. She isn't going to pull out a wand and curse you just for making a joke.* "I'm not sure you're one to judge others on how well they handle losing."

Her eyes narrowed. "I handled our duel with good grace, did I not?"

A smile crested his lips. "You admit you lost, then?" They had jibed back and forth about that for the past two months.

She waved her hand. "It was a draw, but that outcome is unacceptable. Anything short of a win is a loss."

Harry smirked. "And you're judging other people---" she stepped forward and placed a finger to his lips. His pulse quickened, heat filling his cheeks. *She's not Voldemort! Grow up!*

"Shush," she said, removing her finger with a smile as he exhaled. "My hatred of losing has worked well for me. Just because it exists doesn't mean I can't judge others."

"So what about him not losing? He'll feel like he needs a win back, or something?"

"I think it's more the sense he'll be worried. He's turned Russia against him and now he may lose a foothold in Italy. Britain is one of the last defendable places in Europe."

Harry looked around the alley. "Does it really matter where he sets up camp? His enemies can just apparate or portkey."

She sniffed. "You overestimate the average witch or wizard. The channel is a natural defence for anyone who lacks the power for long apparition jumps and we have some of the strongest wards in Europe. He's only stayed away so far because of those wards." Her lips curved into a sneer. "And Dumbledore."

*She really doesn't like him.* Harry would not fight that battle. *It's not like I can blame her after how he acted on Samhain.* "Dumbledore doesn't think Grindelwald is afraid of him."

Emily pondered that. "I think he's afraid of the idea of losing, and Dumbledore is his biggest threat."

Thunder rumbled, a flash overhead sending light rippling across the surface of a nearby puddle. The rain picked up around them. It was less like footsteps now and more like swelling rapids. It was lucky they stood in the shadow of a building whose roof protruded over their heads and blocked the falling rain.

Harry chewed his words, his heart racing. They had come a long way in the past two months, but could he ask her this?

"What is it?" she asked, glaring at him. "What are you thinking?"

Harry jolted. "Just musing."

She raised an eyebrow. "While looking at me like you're judging the ripeness of a fruit?" Harry blushed. "Just ask."

*Sod it, then.* "What do you think of Grindelwald? We've always talked about him, but always what he's doing or what he might do next."

She tilted her head, watching him. "If I answer, will you do the same?"

A chill seeped through him. *The more I talk about Grindelwald, the easier it is to poke holes in my story.* Curiosity gnawed at him, separate from his wariness. *It would be a good chance to judge her character.* Her shocked expression down in the Chamber of Secrets came back to him. *She's not perfect and I've gotten much better at lying this last year.*

"Deal," he said as casually as he could.

"I detest him and everything he stands for." Harry's eyes widened a fraction. *Bloody hell,* "You look surprised."

He schooled his features. *You would be too if you were in my spot...* "I wasn't really sure what to think. He doesn't seem big on blood purity. I guess I thought that might appeal to you."

Her expression darkened. "If it wasn't mixed in with all his other suicidal trash, then perhaps."

His curiosity deepened. "Suicidal trash?"

"Grindelwald's goal is to unite wizardkind under a single banner and destroy the Statute of Secrecy. He thinks we'll rule over muggles for the greater good."

Harry tilted his head. *That sounds like it would appeal to Voldemort.* "And?"

"And he's a fool who knows nothing about muggles. His confidence wouldn't be so high if he'd been trapped in the heat of their bigotry. They're not fighting with swords and shields anymore."

Surprised seized him, disrupting his heartbeat. *The muggles worry her...* "You think the muggles would win a war?"

She scowled. "That isn't what I said. Wizarding deaths are exponentially lower since the introduction of the Statute of Secrecy and that isn't a coincidence. We gain nothing from collapsing the statute but mutually assured destruction. That isn't worth spilling so much blood."

*She's afraid of muggles.* He knew not why it surprised him. *She grew up in London during the Blitz, it makes sense.* Still it felt odd knowing. Voldemort had always been a mythical figure whose loathing of muggles was well-known, but never had Harry imagined there was fear beneath that mask. *She's not Voldemort,* he reminded himself for the thousandth time.

"I believe we had an agreement," she said, tapping her foot against the damp pavement.

Harry tried his best to imitate her sneer and stop himself from fidgeting. "I have no love for Grindelwald."

"May I ask something more personal?" Harry's guard rose, but he nodded. *This could go wrong.* "If you really do dislike Grindelwald, what's the real reason?"

His breath hitched, cold spilling down from his chest and into his stomach. *Fuck!* "W-what?"

"Have you not learned by now I'm not fooled like the others?"

"Grindelwald murdered my parents."

"Yet you've spoken about him with complete calmness. I haven't heard you mention your parents once unprompted, nor anything about your life before Hogwarts." Harry took a step back. *How much has she guessed?* Emily sighed. "I don't expect an answer. I understand you don't trust me. I just hope that, one day, that changes." Harry opened his mouth, but no words came out. Something harsh twisted in the pit of his stomach. *Guilt? Why am I guilty? Ugh! I hate secrets.*

***Later that night...***

A column of swirling green flames gave way to paler columns made from stone, holding up a high ceiling that loomed above a handsome hall done up in gleaming marble.

Harry paid it no heed, stepping from the fireplace, his thoughts still whirling. *How much has she guessed?* Emily could say she expected no answers all she wanted, but they had talked about her patience. If she learned the truth... he knew not what would happen.

*Even Slughorn only knows half, and that's because he's useful.* Guilt knotted in his stomach again. *When did I start thinking about people that way?* Harry reached for another thought, eager to forget his guilt. That was unhelpful right now. *Slughorn... that's not a bad idea.*

He bustled off towards the library, summoning a bottle of ink and a quill, snatching a roll of parchment from a table on the way, his letter mentally penned by the time he sat down to write it.

*Professor,*

*Something urgent came up about our agreement from last summer. Is there any chance we could meet soon? I'd like your advice since I'm a bit shaken.*

*Hope your summer's going well.*

*Cheers,*

*Harry*

It was good. It addressed what he wanted and had a very real note of panic. Slughorn would eat that up and, with any luck, arrange a meeting at his earliest convenience.

*Merlin,* Harry thought for what must be the thousandth time, *when did I get so good at lying and manipulating people?*

It was probably for the best given everything that had happened, but still it made him uneasy. *I can't think that way; think about all the good it's done.* Never would he have imagined being happy about a Slytherin sorting. *Everything would probably have blown up in my face if I was a Gryffindor again.*

*CRACK!*

Harry jumped about a foot in the air, drawing his wand and spinning towards the sound. The Fawleys' house elf yelped, its ears pricking up when it saw the wand levelled at its forehead.

Harry blushed. *Why do the bloody things always jumpscare me.* "Sorry," he said, lowering his wand, "you caught me at a bad time."

"It-it-it's all right, M-M-Master," the elf stammered.

Harry mussed his hair, spilling raindrops down his back. A shiver ran up his spine. "Er, do you have a message, or something?"

The elf straightened, puffing out its chest. *It got confident quick.* "Yes, sir. Master Marshall and Mistress Melody be saying that Mistress Elena is awake."

All thoughts of Emily, Grindelwald, and a time long-lost vanished. "Take me to her."

**Chapter 35: Precious Things**

***July 14, 1943\
The Home of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Fawley\
7:22 AM***

Raindrops drummed against large windows as Harry flipped another page. Thunder boomed and a bright flash sent pale light rippling across the dark grey sky. Panes of glass shuddered in the window before once more settling.

It was among the most miserable stretches of weather Harry could remember. The weather always had a strong impact on his moods. Years spent with the Dursleys trained him to think of the outdoors as his salvation. Seeing the sky just as miserable as that spider-filled cupboard had always sunk his stomach.

*It doesn't even bother me for once.* His friends were awake again and had been for three days. No amount of water could douse the burning joy that still filled him to the brim. The skies could rain glass for all he cared and nothing would change. Emily probably wasn't becoming Voldemort, Abraxas was dealt with, the chamber was no threat, and his friends were awake. Everything was almost perfect.

Almost...

Dorea had been coldly calm upon waking. Her first question had been where Abraxas Malfoy was. Being caught off guard hadn't sat well with her and there had been no pity in her eyes when she was told of what happened to him.

Elena had woken frantically and in a panic. One of her first questions had been what happened. That was harder to answer. Telling Dorea that Abraxas was dead was one thing. But what happened? Merlin, what hadn't happened? His lips had moved and formed the lies he had to tell, but they tasted like spoiled milk and made bile rise in the back of his throat. *I'm so sick of lying.*

This was one thing he always hated and it was one thing he could never change. Being weak was awful, but there were things he could do about that.

Months had been spent fearing what Emily would do and what she might become. Things hadn't exactly gone to plan, but there had been a plan. There were things Harry had at least tried doing.

There was no changing the need for lies. Few things hurt him more than staring into Elena's eyes and reciting the same story about how Abraxas had fallen back and split his skull in a duel with Emily Riddle.

The suspicion in her eyes had been the worst thing of all. *Not that I can blame her.* *I just spent a year being suspicious about Riddle.*

The suspicion in her eyes made him think of all the things he'd had to lie about this past year. *I wish I could just tell the truth about everything.* He had once shared everything with Ron and Hermione, but this was different. *They'd leave me, just like everyone always does any time something unusual happens.* The accidental magic back in muggle school, his Parseltongue back during second year --- both led to the same thing.

Isolation.

He had friends here --- friends just as close as Ron and Hermione had once been. There was nothing in the world he would trade them for and the last thing he would do was throw them away. *If I have to lie to do it, then fine.*

There was also the pressing issue of Emily. Elena was terrified of her and Dorea hyper-suspicious. How was he to tell them they were now friends and that their collective efforts had helped stop Malfoy? They would probably just think she'd gotten to him and that he was spun around her finger the same way most other boys were. *What a mess.*

He had to tell them soon. The veil would be pulled back at Hogwarts and Harry would rather they knew what lurked behind it.

*But if I do...*

Everything was going his way for the first time since landing back in the past.

*Before then, really. When was the last time everything ever went my way?* First year had started well, he supposed. Freedom from the Dursleys, a new world of magic, and a starring role on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. *I guess that would be it, then. Second year started with a demented elf and almost getting expelled. I spent most of third year afraid of being murdered.*

Soft footsteps came from behind him. "Morning, Elena." A smile crossed his lips even as he marked his place in the book and turned his head. She was a sight for sore eyes; his best friend awake again, smiling back at him as real life sparkled behind her bright green eyes.

"Good morning, Harry. I'm glad to know you still sleep well."

He grinned. "I get enough. I'm surprised you're up this early. Didn't the healer say you'd probably need more sleep for a while?"

She looked away. *Uh-oh. I shouldn't have said anything.* "I'll probably nap later. I needed to move after the dreams."

"Ah." His stomach writhed. *What can I say to that?* "Sorry."

Her head jerked back up. "What are you apologizing for? It's not your fault Malfoy was a monster."

A cold fist closed inside his stomach. *No, just that he's dead.* "I still wish I was there sooner."

She scowled. "I'm not some damsel. Dorea and I would have beaten him if he hadn't gotten us from behind."

"Do you feel okay? Other than the dreams, I mean? There was something about a prolonged Cruciatus Curse."

She shuddered. "It hits me from time to time, but just for a few seconds, and the healer said it should pass within a week or so." She looked away again. "Sleeping is the worst part. I always feel like the spell hits me right before I fall asleep and any time I wake up. It's not actual pain, just the memory."

Harry gripped the table hard. Any guilt he felt for Abraxas's death disappeared all at once. *He got better than he deserved. He should have died under the same curse he used on her.*

One of his remaining reservations about Emily was just how unbothered she was by Malfoy's death, but that too faded.

*"Should you mourn for someone who tortured your best friends?"*

*"I don't mourn him, I---"*

*"You're far too good a person. Abraxas deserved everything he got and you know it."*

*No, fuck him. He deserved much worse.*

"Are you all right?" Elena asked, frowning.

"Fine," said Harry, banishing the darkest of his thoughts and forcing a smile. His stomach's writhing returned. *Why have I gotten so good at lying?* "It's just nice having you back again. I get distracted sometimes."

Elena blushed, but smiled. "Don't get too distracted. I have a letter for you."

"A letter?"

She removed it from her robes and passed it over. Harry broke the seal and removed the parchment.

*Harry,*

*I'm sorry about whatever's happened to have you in such a tiff. I can always make time for the likes of you. How about this Saturday in Diagon Alley? There's a wonderful outdoor cafe that's survived everything going on in the world. It's near Gringotts, you can't miss it. Open patio, cherry red umbrellas, beautiful young waitresses; it's a lovely place.*

*I hope to hear back from you soon.*

*All the best,*

*Horace Slughorn*

Knots of guilt tightened inside his stomach as he looked towards his best friend. *And now I get to learn how to lie even more convincingly.*

***July 16, 1943\
Black Manor\
9:33 PM***

Shadows crawled up four dark walls, twisting like demented serpents in the flickering light of several dying torches. There was another lantern in the room's centre, but its fingers of light were too short to reach any of the room's sides, instead serving only the girl sitting cross-legged as it hovered above her.

Dorea's heart rate finally calmed as she turned another page in her book. Tonight had featured a full gathering of the family in her honour. It was supposedly a celebration of her return, but it felt more like an interrogation about why she'd left in the first place. Dorea shuddered just thinking about the dinner. So many unpleasant questions leading to so many unpleasant memories.

Waves of heat melted the chill inside her stomach as angry red blotches crawled up her arms. Her face flushed and her fingers trembled. What she would have done to meet Abraxas one last time. Never before had she hoped for one of Riddle's schemes, but now she did. *Let her have tortured him to death over some kind of slight. A freak accident is too merciful.*

"You do realize how predictable you are, don't you?"

Dorea looked up with a sigh. "You do realize how rude it is to pester your sick little sister, don't you?"

Arcturus's smile looked sinister in the light of a flickering torch. He passed through it and to the room's centre, taking a seat beside her. "How do you feel?"

Dorea sighed. *He's not going to let me shrug this off.* "Better. The phantom pains have mostly stopped."

Arcturus continued staring. "Pain is minor. You know what I meant."

Dorea crossed her arms, her face twisting into a tight glare. "Angry, upset, embarrassed? I don't know, Arcturus, what do you want from me?"

A pained look crossed his face. "I don't want anything from you --- I want things for you. Father hasn't exactly done his part in keeping up with you, so someone has to."

"I wish it could be my friends." The words came out soaked in venom, but she didn't care. Let them sting. She actually took satisfaction in the cracks in his composure, rippling across his face like splintering ice.

"You don't have to wish."

Her bitter thoughts froze as his words sank in. "What?"

"Pavonis and I made a deal. It just happened right before you were attacked."

Her heart raced. *Now he tells me this!* "And you're going to stick to it? Even after what happened?"

His hands twisted in his lap, his weight shifting from side to side. "That was a freak accident and not part of our agreement. It's Riddle who worries me; I never even considered Abraxas would do something like that. Unless Pavonis slips up in upholding his side or I find out Riddle was somehow behind it, I'm not about to back out of the agreement." He grimaced. "I do try and be a man of my word, even if you don't always like it."

The tension she had been holding since waking finally broke as she threw herself at Arcturus. She almost knocked him flat; this sort of outburst was the last thing he had expected.

"You sure you're all right?" he asked again. Dorea could hear the smile in his voice even as her head burrowed into his chest and his fingers gently stroked her hair.

"I'm getting there," she said in a voice that shook. "This will definitely help."

***July 17, 1943\
Diagon Alley\
2:11 PM***

The skies above had finally smoothed. Whilst still bleak, they no longer poured water, nor were they shattered by jagged bolts of lightning. The one nice thing about the abhorred weather was that it had broken the awful humidity that had come before. Now the air was unseasonably cool; it felt more like the beginning of May than the middle of July.

Slughorn took another pull of mead and quickly belched into his napkin. He chuckled, rubbing his bulging stomach and refocusing on Harry. "I'm glad to hear you've recovered from your ordeal. Seeing Abraxas's accident... Merlin's beard, I feel for you and Emily both."

Harry smiled a very strained smile. "Thank you, sir. I think we're both doing okay now, but it was hard in the beginning."

"I can only imagine." Slughorn shook his head. "Dark tidings," he muttered. "Are the Fawleys treating you well?"

Harry blinked; that was a very sudden question. "Yes, sir, they always have."

"Good, good," he trailed off, a far-away look in his eyes.

"Professor? Are you all right?"

"Hm? Oh, yes. Quite so, m'boy, quite so. An old man gets distracted now and then. What was it you wrote about? Some kind of trouble?"

Harry took a deep breath, his heart fluttering. *In for a knut, in for a galleon.* "Emily knows our story's fake. She told me so about a week ago."

Slughorn sighed. "That girl is far too clever for her own good. It's no real surprise. You can only fool a mind like hers for so long."

Harry leant forward. "What do I do?"

"That is entirely up to you, m'boy."

Harry frowned. *Well that's unhelpful.* "It is?" Slughorn had always guided him closely in things like this. Having it pinned entirely on his shoulders took him by surprise.

Slughorn chortled. "Sometimes I think that you forget I don't know where you came from. All I know is that you were talking nonsense last summer and that you needed a helping hand."

*Trust me, I don't forget.* How could he? If Slughorn treated him like this now, he could only imagine what it would be like if he knew the truth. *He does seem like the type who would sell the secrets for some gold. Hell, could probably tempt him with some of that pineapple if you caught him on the right day.*

"I can't just tell her."

"Can't you?"

Harry shook his head, biting down a grimace. "There are reasons you don't know, sir. There are things I *never* want brought up again."

Slughorn's moustache quivered. "You're sure, m'boy? You couldn't do much better in a confidant than Emily."

Crimson eyes burned out from the back of Quirrell's head and Tom Riddle smiled a sharp smile down in the Chamber of Secrets. Trelawney seized up in the midst of their exam, her words echoing off the tower's round walls. "I'm sure, Professor."

Slughorn looked disappointed for a moment, but his expression smoothed back over. "Well, all right. If she's onto you, you won't convince her she's wrong. Emily's a smart girl and she knows it. Not one to doubt herself and very strong-willed."

*Strong-willed? Is that what you call it?* "That's probably an understatement."

Slughorn chuckled again. "Quite. No, I'm sorry, m'boy, but you won't convince her she's wrong."

"A different story, then? A story within a story; something more believable this time."

"I think that would be best," Slughorn agreed.

Harry drummed his fingers against the table. "What kind of story should it be? What would keep her off my back?"

The Potions Master twirled his long moustache. "A real query. Nothing that might pique her curiosity. Once that girl walks down a path, she'll never turn back."

*Let's just hope she keeps away from Voldemort's, then.* She would. He had to keep telling himself that. This was not Tom Riddle.

"But it can't be too far from my last cover story, can it?" Harry asked with a frown. "That'd be obvious."

Slughorn nodded. "The best lies are always formed from little bits of truth. Always remember that, Harry."

His stomach panged. *I don't want to remember how to lie.* "What about Emily specifically? Is there anything I can do to make it more believable for her?"

Slughorn thought for a moment, then snapped his fingers. "Why, of course." He chortled. "We've talked about it already!"

Harry's fingers ceased their drumming. "We have?"

"Her stubbornness. Brilliant girl, but by Merlin, she knows it." *You're telling me.* "Believing she's right is easier for her than believing she's wrong."

Harry's eyes widened as an idea took hold. "So I make a part of the story something she already believes? That way she won't doubt the rest of it."

Slughorn beamed. "Precisely."

***July 31, 1943***

***The Home of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Fawley***

***8:34 AM***

Harry stepped from the library and moved down the hall, squinting against the bright sunlight streaming in from a window on his left. Cracks of it had shown behind the heavy curtains in the library, but he'd kept them closed and now it blazed across the hall, pooling in warm circles beneath his feet.

His heart beat faster than usual as he walked towards the dining room. An elf had summoned him for breakfast. That wasn't unusual, but it happened less frequently now than last year. Doing anything for his birthday still felt odd, but that didn't mean he couldn't connect the dots and realize this was probably more than a simple coincidence.

His step faltered when he entered the dining room. A wall of noise slammed against him as the call of "Happy birthday!" rang through the room, but that was not what took him aback. That was the pale, dark-haired girl who threw herself at him with such force, he staggered.

"Dorea?" Their talk in the hospital had been brief. He hadn't known where they stood since the attack happened so soon after his deal with Arcturus, and she obviously hadn't either.

Now she clung to him, her face in his chest as she took deep, shaking breaths. Something twisted inside his chest. *She's crying.* This was a new experience. His limbs felt heavy, his footing unsteady. What was he to do?

Harry steeled himself and wrapped his arms around her. She did likewise and squeezed hard as her tears slowed. Any other time, he would have been a blustering mess. His face was flushed a deep shade of crimson but, for once, he didn't care.

*Who cares about being awkward. I have Dorea back; that's all I could ever want for my birthday.*

***August 8, 1943\
Little Hangleton\
8:47 PM***

The sun finally dipped below a high hill. Already long shadows swelled. Bright patches of orange faded overhead, replaced by faint streaks and then gone altogether as Emily trudged towards a handsome manor home, Morfin's wand twirling through her fingers.

It was pathetic how easy this was. Grindelwald and his foolishness could slowly die in Fiendfyre, but the resistance against him was almost as bad. He was a psychopathic lunatic that would ruin their world. That was why people should oppose him, yet most who stood against him did so only out of fear. Fear not of Grindelwald, but of the thought of change.

*Pathetic. How can they take their deluded highground when common sense could melt the world around them? How can they ignore the need for change when a sixteen-year-old girl can fool their infrastructure so easily?*

What good was something like the trace? All it did was limit children's growth. It did nothing for justice --- how could it when it detected nothing of relevance? How could wizards rely on something that she could fool just by taking another's wand?

She flicked it and the gates swung open. The wand matched poorly, but it mattered not. It was functional, just mundane.

*The exceptional magic is already done. All that's left is crushing bugs.*

The manor's door burst open with another flick of the wand and Emily stepped across the threshold. Four people lounged in the nearby sitting room. There was no need for Homenum Revelio; sensing muggles' minds was like reading young children.

Footsteps rushed down the hall. "Who are you?" a cold voice asked. "I warn you, I'm armed!"

"Avada Kedavra."

Green light filled the hall as the man's rifle bounced off the floor, his body falling beside it.

Emily stepped over him and continued down the hall. All noise from the sitting room had ceased. Two women sat huddled closely together on a plush sofa. The younger of the two had light brown hair and wide brown eyes. She stared from Emily's face to the wand in her hand as her lip trembled.

*Told you about magic, has he? I wonder how much of it he remembers from my mother?*

The lone man in the room glared at her, unmasked hatred in familiar blue eyes. "You're one of them!" he spat. "What do you want?"

Emily stared unblinkingly back, drinking in every inch of a man she hated most. "Hello, Father."

His eyes widened. "You---"

"Me." Her own voice remained calm.

"You will leave!" said an elderly woman with greying hair, standing from the couch on shaky legs. "Tom's told me all about your type and we won't have one."

"Mother! Calm down." There was a definite note of urgency in Tom Riddle's voice. "What do you want?" he asked. "Money? I can give you that; I have plenty. Just leave."

"Where's Timothy?" the grey-haired woman asked. Emily's face remained blank as she jerked her head back towards the hallway. *He shouldn't have threatened me.* The woman's hands trembled. "You'll get nothing from us, you bitch!" the woman screamed, reaching for a nearby knife.

She never reached it, cut down by another flash of green light that left her slumped lifelessly across the sofa. *Fool.*

"Martha!" the younger woman screamed before she too fell.

"What did you do?" Tom Riddle hissed, eyes wide, face pale.

Emily's heart thundered against her ribs. "Killed them."

"You're lying! I know you are! What do you want? Please! Take anything, just undo what you did and leave!"

Her blood boiled, hot anger rushing beneath her skin. "If only you were so agreeable sixteen years ago." Her voice was barely louder than a whisper, but it ripped through the room like a cold winter wind.

"Your mother---"

"Was weak and meaningless." A cold storm raged inside her. "I don't care about my mother. She died giving birth, and I know she bewitched you. Leaving her means nothing; leaving me was different."

"I never knew---"

"Only because you chose not to." She levelled her wand, but it trembled slightly. *This is it!* "I stopped wanting things from you a long time ago, back when I realized they'd never come." She took a deep, steadying breath. "None of that matters. You're going to make up for it by giving me the last thing I want; the thing I want above all else." Emily stared into his eyes, memorizing his features, dredging up all the pent-up anger felt in the past sixteen years. "Goodbye, Father."

"Please---"

"Avada Kedavra!"

Tom Riddle fell like a puppet with its strings cut, but Emily never heard his body hit the floor. Her thoughts turned inwards as she reached down within herself.

She almost recoiled. It was like her mind was touching a thousand shattered bits of glass, each scoring burning cuts across her skin that grew deeper the longer she examined them. Awful cold filled her.

*Finally.*

She focused everything on one shattered piece just like the book had said. She seized it --- there was no other way of describing it --- and pulled.

Pain more awful than anything she had imagined exploded in every pore. Nothing could ever compare to this. She'd known it would hurt, but Merlin, not like this.

*It's worth it!* a strained voice whispered. *There's nothing that isn't worth it. A few more seconds and you'll be free forever.*

That voice was right. There was nothing Emily wouldn't give for this. Images flashed before her eyes. Her trinkets, her books, her wand, and even her home; all of it could burn if that was what it took.

High cheekbones and dark hair framed brilliant emerald eyes; the only eyes that ever met hers without wavering.

The pain faded. She collapsed and shuddered, coughing thick, coppery spray upon the fine tiled floor.

*It worked!*

Joy raged inside her like a roaring storm. It tore through every thought she had; nothing else mattered. This feeling, like her, would never end.

Then her hand touched the ring.

It remained cold and empty, unchanged and without a trace of magic.

The storm died, snuffed out by a single realization.

Her heart skipped a beat. *That's impossible! I did everything right!* She scrambled up to her knees, feeling for magic.

There was nothing.

Everything was perfect. The preparations went smoothly, the curse unleashed with the purest hatred she'd ever known. She had felt her fragmented soul and tore at it, just like the book had said.

*Murder wounds the soul, but not beyond repair. That takes more than a spell and is achieved only by single-minded intent. You must kill with malice and find pleasure in the deed. You must want what comes with a shattered soul more than anything else. There must be nothing you would not sacrifice, nothing you would not destroy to continue on.*

Numb shock gripped her so tightly that the breath froze in her lungs.

*It can't be. It's nothing but a childish fancy.*

Emily knew she was wrong. She'd had no trouble continuing to pull, even when faced with thoughts of losing her wand and her home. Neither of them had given her pause, but a single face had --- a single face who had unknowingly changed everything and left her truly lost.

**Chapter 36: Longing Shadows**

***August 26, 1943\
The Home of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Fawley\
8:13 PM***

Dying sunlight bled through large glass windows. Shadows stretched across the library, covering his two friends' faces across the desk. It was like the weather was making up for how poor July had been. There had scarcely been a day in August where the sky was not a brilliant shade of blue.

It could have continued storming for all Harry cared. It had been the best month of his life. More of it than ever was spent with Dorea and Elena --- a dynamic he'd been starved of these past few months.

"Arcturus isn't coming back to Hogwarts this year, is he?" Elena asked.

"No, he graduated already," said Dorea, not looking at Harry. *She must think I hate Arcturus.* He couldn't hate him. There had been times he wanted to, but he understood. How could he hate someone for protecting one of his friends?

"What's he getting up to now?" *Hopefully me asking will make her realize she's paranoid.*

Dorea smirked. "Being bored out of his mind." Her expression darkened. "Serves him right after last year."

"Something tells me he's not the type to sit around."

"You have no idea. Father would never let him toil away at some job, but Arcturus would prefer if he did. I don't think running the family is appealing to him and sitting around while he slowly takes on Father's duties and gets ready to take over is even worse."

Harry grimaced. "That sounds like my definition of hell." *Maybe the two of us would even get along.*

*Not now,* another voice whispered. *Not now that you really are friends with Emily*. That would surely rub Arcturus the wrong way. *It's not like I can blame him; he just better not take Dorea away again.*

He and Emily had scarcely talked in August after spending so much time together. Something had her occupied. She mailed him, but her letters had been strange for a while. They had become more normal in the past week or so and they were set to meet tomorrow along with all the others in Diagon Alley, but something had happened that put her in an odd mood. *Must be the orphanage. Merlin knows Privet Drive never did good things to my head.*

His lungs shrank when he thought of Emily, or so it felt. He looked from Dorea to Elena. *No more putting it off. They're not stupid and Dorea will figure out the game's changed soon.*

Her eyes narrowed, right on cue. "What are you thinking?"

"That you're some sort of secret legilimens."

Elena giggled. "Secret? She's a Black, isn't she?"

Dorea swatted her on the arm. "Hush, you." She looked back at Harry. "Come on --- out with it."

Harry looked from one girl to the other and took a deep breath. *Here goes nothing.* "I've changed my opinion about Riddle."

The room's temperature dropped. It had been warm just a moment ago, but now he suppressed a shiver. "And what is your new opinion?" Dorea asked, expression blank.

Harry took another deep breath. *Merlin, her stare's unnerving.* "I think she's alright." He held up his hands, forestalling interjections that never came. "When you guys were petrified, she helped me work out it was Abraxas." A slight blush crept up his cheeks. "She actually figured it out, then showed me." *Better if they don't know I knew before they were attacked; I'd die of shame.*

"How did she know?" asked Elena.

"She thought whoever it was wanted to frame her. You know, Heir of Slytherin a few weeks after she spoke Parseltongue and all that. She looked into it and put the whole thing together." Harry swallowed a lump in his throat. *I can't tell them about Cerastes. Why does there have to be so many secrets?*

Dorea watched him closely. *Here it comes; she'll say I'm brainwashed, then I'll lose her again.* "It wasn't an accident, was it?"

Harry blinked. "Come again?"

"Abraxas's death; it wasn't an accident. Riddle meant to kill him."

"We meant to turn him in." *That isn't a complete lie. It's what I meant to do and it was once her plan too, framed or not.* "Abraxas just had more fight than we realized. Riddle's spell caught him and the rest happened like I said back in the hospital."

Harry waited. Any moment accusations would seep from their eyes. Any moment they would realize everything he'd just said and the problems would begin. Any moment his summer would cease being the best he'd ever known.

"How do you know she isn't playing you like the others?" Dorea's voice was calm; her expression gave nothing away.

*Because a basilisk played us both and forced us both to speak our minds.* "I don't think she's an amazing person, or anything," he said. *At least that's true.* "But I don't think she's awful. I don't think she has any plans that are going to ruin the world and..." he hesitated, here was the hard part. "We have a lot in common; we've sort of become friends."

*Now the bomb goes off.* "How confident are you?" Elena's voice was a touch shrill, but otherwise unreadable.

Harry tried ignoring the way his heart beat against his ribs. "I'm not a legilimens, so I can't be positive, but I'm confident. We're not best friends or anything, but... well, she's always treated me well and I'm giving it a shot."

Elena closed her eyes. "I trust you."

That was it --- she said no more. Fondness swelled inside him. No questions, no doubts, just trust. Never had Harry had a friend quite like her. "Thank you, Elena." She offered him a smile.

Dorea took a steadying breath. "Arcturus won't like it if he finds out."

Cold ice seeped through his stomach. "I'll just say I'm going along with her and infiltrating, or something."

Dorea drummed her fingers on the desk's edge. "I don't trust her, either." Harry's heart sank. *Here it comes.* "But I'll trust you and try."

Harry almost gaped. "You will?"

Dorea rolled her eyes. "I don't like Riddle. I don't like what she does to other people, how manipulative she is, or how she goes about proving her points. She's a menace, but she's never really hurt anyone." Her eyes turned hard again. "Don't think I'll just roll over. If I see anything that I think is suspicious, I'll be the first one to confront you about it."

Harry looked from one girl to the other, sure he was dreaming. "Are you okay?" Elena asked.

Harry shook himself. "I... was worried that might go a lot worse." He offered them a sheepish smile. "Thank you."

Dorea jutted out her chin. "I make good friends. You were watching her closely for months and aren't an idiot. I'll trust your judgement, at least until I have reason not to."

A sharp pin punched a hole through his bubble of relief, allowing heavy guilt to seep inside. It choked him. *Bloody secrets! Even when they help get what I want, they still find a way to hurt me.*

***August 27, 1943\
Diagon Alley\
12:58 PM***

Swirling green flames faded, leaving him standing in a smouldering hearth facing out into a dark room that appeared even darker. Bright spots swirled around his vision, the green flames still burning behind his eyes. They faded soon, finally letting him look out into the shabby confines of the Leaky Cauldron.

Harry's heart raced just standing here. Once this place had unnerved him because of how his first visit had gone. The crowd of people had been suffocating; it was the only thing from that first magical day he had never treasured.

Now this place unnerved him for a different reason. It was impossible to look around and not remember that day more than a year ago; the day when he had appeared and realized everything he knew was lost forever.

Someone moved from a shadowy corner. Harry stepped from the fireplace when he saw her. "Hey, Dorea."

"Hi, Harry. Just waiting for Elena?" He nodded as the fire burst to life again, a dark silhouette framed against the flames.

The two girls embraced and the trio left the Leaky Cauldron. Another shiver ran up Harry's spine when he stepped outside. His hand drifted towards his wand. *Try me now, you bastards! I don't need a professor's help this time.*

It would have been easy forgetting last year's attack had he not lived it. Anything destroyed by Grindelwald's men had been repaired. More shops appeared closed now, more windows barred, but that would probably have happened even without them. The war was taking its toll on Britain just like the rest of Europe.

That was even more obvious here than Hogsmeade. Just on their way to the cafe, the trio saw three crying children begging their mothers for gifts they couldn't afford. The robes on display were drab greys and plain blacks; hardly any colour could be seen at all.

They walked past the cafe Harry had spent time at not long ago with Slughorn, stepping into another. A waiter greeted them the moment they entered, dressed in robes as plain as the ones outside. "Do you have a reservation?"

"It should be under Romulus Lestrange."

The man scanned a sheet of parchment, then nodded. "Right this way, please."

The cafe was small but appeared to have escaped the worst effects of the war. Magical spheres of light hung above each table, ladened with gilded goblets and gleaming silverware. Something twisted inside Harry's stomach. *The rich and powerful are always protected; even in the middle of war.*

Their booth was magically enlarged or else it would never fit them all. Rosier, Dolohov, and Mulciber sat on one side, whilst Emily, Cassie, and Lestrange lounged on the other.

Her stare found him the moment he drew near. It made hairs rise on the back of his neck almost like it had back when he tried avoiding her. *Something's definitely changed.*

Harry took a seat right beside her. "How have the two of you been since recovering from Malfoy's attack?" she asked Dorea and Elena.

"Better now," said Dorea, who hardly ever spoke in front of Riddle. *Merlin, she's making a real effort. "*I still get flashes of the Cruciatus Curse, but they're just memories at this point." Elena shivered, but nodded.

Riddle pursed her lips. "I've heard of that happening post-Cruciatus Curse. The mind rarely recovers easily from things like that." Riddle chewed her words. "Do either of you know Occlumency?"

Harry forced himself not to gape; Riddle's other friends looked surprised. "I know of it," said Dorea. "I've practiced the basics, but nothing more."

Elena shook her head. "I've never practiced."

"You should. It might help control the flashes. I'd guess they happen when your mind is at its most subconscious? Maybe when asleep or close to?" Both girls nodded. "I can teach you some, if you'd like? I should really be doing that anyway."

Harry could hardly believe what was happening. *Merlin, something really has changed.*

***That evening...***

Banks of fog rose, so thick he could see nothing. *I am dreaming; nothing about this is natural.*

The fog began twisting, thinning in places. Gravestones loomed, rows of shadows that became clearer the longer he looked. Vision returned, cool mist hanging in the air. Hedges ringed the graveyard, nestled in the shadow of an old church. Beyond the fence, a hill sloped up towards what must have been a manor.

The mist writhed, taking the form of something vaguely human. Its features sharpened and solidified until a man stood before him. *So familiar yet so different. I might have fought his kin if not for his eyes.*

The raven-haired man turned away. The last remaining bank of fog cleared, revealing a stone archway marred by cracks. It looked fit to crumble at any moment, like a layer of ice stretched thin across a thawing river. Strange voices came from that archway, whispers that were gone with the faintest gust of wind.

The man studied the archway then closed his emerald eyes. Silver gleamed as a dagger slid from his sleeve. It trembled in a shaking hand, then moved up towards the man's own throat.

It slashed across but spilled no blood. Something dark poured from the wound. If shadows turned to smoke, they would look like this, wafting towards the archway then drifting through.

Something stepped from the archway, it too a mere shadow. *It came from nowhere, yet I felt no conjuration nor twisting of magic.*

The man's eyes opened, fixed unblinkingly on the shadow that glided towards him. "The last enemy to be destroyed is death."

His eyes opened, a long breath hissing out from between his lips. His skull pounded and his limbs felt weak. Darkness still loomed outside the nearest window. *A small mercy. I doubt I could rise.*

His heart raced, blood thundering in his ears. A foretelling... it had been a long time since his last. *But what does it mean?*

Gellert grunted with the effort of sitting up but made himself do it. An amulet flew into his outstretched hand. "Another piece to this complex game," he muttered, turning the amulet over in his fingers. "Where do you fit?" he asked aloud, the man's face still burning behind his eyes.

**Chapter 37: Tenuous Treaties**

***September 1, 1943***

***The Hogwarts Express***

***11:02 AM***

Harry strolled through the train in a daze, fingering the badge upon his chest. *I never imagined I'd be a prefect.*

He paused near a window. The train had begun moving and King's Cross was already behind them. Street lamps flashed past the glass, squat buildings coming and going behind them. He looked down, studying his reflection in the badge. It almost felt wrong. Prefects were people like Percy and Hermione --- diligent, clean-nosed students who upheld the rules.

*I should have expected it. Slughorn's the Head of House, it was his choice.* Vacant eyes stared up from beneath perfect blond hair, Riddle faced him in the Chamber of Secrets, Cerastes looming over them. *I wonder what Slughorn would think if he knew what his newest prefect got up to.*

"I don't understand why you're so surprised," said Dorea, her own badge gleaming. "You're the best in our year by miles and one of Slughorn's favourites."

"I'm not exactly much of a rule follower, though."

"Do you have any idea how few prefects actually follow their own rules?"

Harry looked up from his badge. "People still have to listen to them, though. I'm not sure how much luck I'll have making a house of purebloods listen to me when they've never heard my name before."

"They've all heard your name after last year. Blood matters, but there are exceptions. Riddle is one, and everyone remembers who won that duel."

*The duel... I hadn't thought of that in ages. It's like it never happened.* For weeks it had plagued his thoughts, the most nervous he had been in months. *So much happened right after, it's like it never mattered.*

"Come on," said Dorea, reaching for his hand, "we can't be late for the meeting."

Most of the other prefects had arrived by the time the pair stepped inside a magically enlarged compartment. Twelve students sat on each side, a white-clothed table covered in confections nestled between them. Their eyes briefly tracked Harry and Dorea before returning to the two students standing over them.

"Charlus!" Harry said, grinning, spying the older boy's new badge. "I never realized they made you Head Boy."

The Potter heir grinned back. "Who else would they give it to?" he said, winking then seizing his hand. "How was your summer?"

"Probably the best I've had once my friends recovered."

"Ah." Charlus looked past him towards Dorea, a slight flush in his cheeks. Harry resisted the urge to smile. *I hope that happens here, just like it did in my own world.* "Er, how's the recovery gone so far?"

Dorea smiled. "It's gone well. I still feel some effects, but not often."

"Good, good." Charlus appeared to realize that everyone in the room was watching them. "Right, sit down, you two, then we'll get started."

Harry began questioning how fond Slughorn really was of him. Being a prefect sounded like an awful lot of work. How was he going to fit weekly patrols, paperwork, and meetings in with classes, duelling, and practicing?

His breath hitched, seized by a sudden revelation. His eyes flicked towards Riddle, sitting attentively with her hands in her lap. A black ring hung on one finger, etched with a marking too faint to read. *Weird, I don't remember her wearing that before.*

He pulled his thoughts away from her jewellery and considered other things. Did he need to keep practicing? Riddle was his friend now. His trust was not complete, but it was there. *I don't think she'll become Voldemort, at least.*

Nervousness harassed him, shoving memories of their trip to Diagon Alley in his face. She had been acting strangely. *It was probably just being back at the orphanage. Merlin knows I never felt right on Privet Drive.* She would turn seventeen that December and would then be free to leave, so that problem would vanish soon. *She could still become Voldemort --- anything is possible.*

It looked wrong in his mind's eye, the picture of her as Voldemort. It just didn't click. *If I don't really believe she'll ruin the world, why do I still feel like I need to train?*

Harry cleared his mind and considered things more closely, surprised by the results. Practicing and duelling felt like Quidditch had in his own time. He felt the need not because of any obligation, but because he enjoyed it and wanted to improve.

Ron's incredulous face swam behind his eyes. *Ron would have kittens if he knew how much I liked studying now.* Hermione beamed beneath a mess of bushy-brown hair. *She'd be over the moon.* No sadness came when thinking about them now, just a strange void. Not emptiness, but a disconnect born from knowing they'd never meet again.

The meeting lasted several hours. The longer it went, the more his thoughts drifted. His marks might have risen and his work had improved, but he would never have patience for things like this. *There's a reason I still scored low in Astronomy and History --- too many lectures.*

Schedules were passed out once it finally ended. Harry's night-time patrol would be on Thursday evenings and he would be one of the last to scour the train while everyone disembarked.

"I've got patrol duty now," sighed Dorea, looking down at her schedule.

"So do I," said Riddle, not looking at hers. *She probably has the whole thing memorized already.* "We can keep each other company if you'd like."

Harry tensed, looking from one girl to the other. Dorea's face was expressionless, her mood unreadable.

"All right," she said, surprising him. "Things will probably be easier if I patrol with someone who isn't doing it for the first time."

Harry watched them go, eyes narrowed. Dorea had agreed to trust him and put up with Riddle, but this was unexpected. *There's no way Riddle won her over just by offering to help her learn more Occlumency. What's her game?*

Dorea's heart raced as the door closed behind them. *Damn you, Harry! Why did I ever agree to this?* She glanced sideways at Riddle, who looked calm as ever. There was no way she didn't realize how awkward this was, but she looked completely at ease. *Ugh! She's maddening.*

No words passed between them for some time. They caught two first-year girls bullying a third, and a pair of fourth years experimenting with human transfiguration. *Don't they know how badly that will go without practice?*

"We need to get better at this."

Dorea's head snapped around. "Get better at what?"

"Coexisting."

Dorea glanced up and down the corridor, but not a single head poked out from any of the compartments. "What do you mean?"

"You distrust me. It makes spending time with you harder than it needs to be."

*She makes it sound like an arithmetic equation.* "Why does it matter? I don't trust you and I doubt you appreciate that. We can agree to disagree and just get on quietly."

"You don't give him enough credit."

"Him?"

"Harry."

"What about him?"

"The only reason you're tolerating me right now is because him and I have become friends."

"So?"

"I'm sure he appreciates the thought, but do you really want him to spend the entire year feeling awkward any time the two of us are in a room?"

Dorea blushed. "I can be perfectly civil---"

"He's no fool, Black. Losing you and Fawley took a toll on him. He'll do almost anything to make sure that never happens again, but he is also my friend. I don't want him to have to choose between the two of us."

Dorea bristled. "So you want me to like you for the sake of your friendship with Harry?"

"No. I want you to better coexist with me for the sake of everyone." A shadow crossed her face. "I don't think Harry will choose between us, but I think the tension will weigh him down."

*Would he pick between us?* Dorea couldn't imagine him doing it, but what if things got tense enough? *He would pick me, right?* She shook herself the moment the thought arose. *Stupid! Have some compassion; he can be friends with whoever he likes.*

Dorea took a deep breath. "I don't trust you," she said. "I'm worried your interest in Harry has nothing to do with friendship."

"Is there anything I can do to appease you?"

Dorea glared. "Be a good and honest friend."

"I plan to, but it doesn't need to be between only Harry and I. I don't hold your distrust against you."

Dorea took another deep breath. "I'll try my best to be friendly and not to suck the air from a room, but I will be watching."

Riddle's lips curved upwards. "I would be disappointed in you and Harry's taste in friends if you didn't watch."

The final first year scampered towards the Gryffindor table, suddenly ladened down by a hundred heaps of food. Roast beef dripped with gravy on a platter near Harry while, beside it, salmon swam in a sweet-smelling sauce.

"Hungry?" Riddle asked, watching him pile his plate high.

"Starving," he answered. Food early that afternoon in the prefects' compartment had only prepared his stomach for more and his stress had only built while Dorea patrolled with Riddle.

Not that he distrusted either, but Dorea really did dislike Riddle and he was anxious about how well she could control that distaste. When they returned with smiles, it was like a weight lifted off his shoulders. He knew those rifts were not yet healed, but perhaps today had been a start.

"Have you heard about the war while living with the muggles?" Mulciber asked Riddle, catching Harry's attention.

"Occasional snippets, but not much more."

"An ICW strike team breached Germany about a week ago."

Emily finished chewing before she answered. "Given that the war is still ongoing, I assume that Grindelwald escaped."

"They were sure he'd been there since retreating from Russia, but he wasn't at any of the bases they hit."

"Could he have fled when he realized what they were doing?" asked Dolohov.

"No," said Rosier, "there were some serious wards put up when the team landed. I doubt even Grindelwald could break them."

"I don't know," said Lestrange, "have you heard the stories about him?"

"Stories?"

"People say he\'s invincible. There are stories about him duelling dozens of wizards at a time, or destroying cities with a single spell."

"They say he's found the Elder Wand," whispered Mulciber. "I believe them, that's the only way any of those stories could be true."

"The what?" asked Harry, a frown on his lips.

"The Elder Wand," said Emily. "There's a fairytale about how it's the most powerful wand ever made. I came across the story while researching wand lore after our duel. It's nonsense."

"Nonsense?" asked Mulciber. "Emeric the Evil had that wand, everyone knows that."

Emily raised an eyebrow. "If you were a dark lord facing revolts, wouldn't you tell the world you had a weapon more powerful than anything they could muster? Doesn't that sound like a good way of discouraging resistance?" Mulciber opened his mouth, then closed it. "If the Elder Wand existed, there would be more than myths and rumours. An object so powerful would leave a factual paper trail; that's only logical."

"How do you explain it, then?" asked Lestrange.

"Explain what?"

"The stories."

She waved a hand. "Grindelwald is an extremely skilled wizard. I have no doubt he can duel multiple opponents at the same time. Dozens is an exaggeration; a story made to scare his opponents just like Emeric boasting about his wand. And destroying a city isn't as infeasible as you make it sound. I know at least one spell that could theoretically do enough damage."

A shiver ran up Harry's spine. *What kind of spell could destroy an entire city? That sounds mad.*

"Do you think the war will end soon?" Dolohov asked.

Emily shrugged. "Who's to say? It would take a team of talented wizards to kill Grindelwald and they don't seem to be having much luck. I doubt the war will end so long as he's alive."

Harry had always assumed Dumbledore would defeat Grindelwald here just like he had back in his own world, but he was growing less sure. If Riddle was not destined to become Voldemort, the timelines were far from identical. His palms began sweating. *What will happen if Dumbledore never fights Grindelwald, or if he fights and loses?*

"My father thinks he'll attack Britain soon," said Rosier. "He says that Grindelwald vanishing from his bases after most of a year proves that he's moving on. There's been no sign of him near Russia, so he must have a new target."

Emily's face twitched. *She's hiding something.* He remembered their talk in Diagon Alley, the way she had looked when asked about Grindelwald and what she had said.

*"I detest him and everything he stands for."*

The food vanished, replaced by desserts beyond imagination. Several of the boys lost interest, distracted by treacle tart and lemon meringue pie.

*She really hates Grindelwald,* Harry thought, noticing the way Emily relaxed when the topic moved on. *This really is going to be an interesting few years.*

**Harry Potter and the Conjoining of Paragons**

**Chapter 38: Folk Tales**

***September 2, 1943***

***The Dungeons***

***9:02 PM***

Harry walked down an empty corridor, already regretting the badge gleaming on his chest. Tonight was Thursday, the night he'd met Charlus to practice duelling last year. Between his prefect duties and the Potter heir's spot as Head Boy, finding time that worked for them both was proving difficult. *Instead I'm stuck patrolling the castle, looking for students snogging in broom closets or something.*

Part of him yearned to slip off and practice, or else sneak down to the Chamber of Secrets. *Not on the first night patrolling. Hold it together.* Harry fought a sigh. Had Slughorn really thought him best-suited for the job, or had he just thought it would help him one day?

Something moved behind him. Harry spun, reaching for his wand. Memories of duelling Abraxas in the corridors came to mind. *Stupid! You should have paid more attention.*

"Jumpy, are we?" asked Emily, hands empty and eyebrows raised.

Harry exhaled, lowering his wand. "Don't do that, you might get cursed."

Her lips twitched. "I'll keep it in mind, but you don't scare me."

Harry hesitated. *Sod it, she's been a good friend since I started trusting her.* "Maybe I should. I did win the duel."

He held his breath, unsure how she would react. She laughed, a soft sound accentuated by the gleam in her eyes. "The real question isn't what happened when we duelled, but whether you think it would end the same way if we duelled again."

Harry suppressed a scowl. He remembered the frustration and the anger brought forth by that duel all too well. She had controlled its action until their wands connected. *I'm probably still not good enough yet.* "Hard to say," he said. "If you fell for my master plan again, then maybe."

"Did you ever research the effect after our duel?"

He shook his head. "You mentioned something about it last night. Something about how looking into that led you to stories about the Elder Wand."

"It's hard not to stumble across the story when researching wand lore. There isn't exactly much written."

Harry pondered his next words. "Do you actually believe what you said last night about the wand and it being a myth?"

"I'm less confident than I implied, but yes. I don't see how something so powerful wouldn't leave a clear paper trail. The odds of it remaining so hidden must be infinitesimally small."

"But you think it could exist?"

He waited, letting the pause hang. "It's possible," she admitted. "The Chamber of Secrets was a myth until we both found it last year. I would have expected someone to stumble across that too, but I doubt the wand would be safeguarded by Parseltongue."

Harry glanced around the corridor and extended his senses, ensuring no one lurked out of sight. "If it does exist, do you think Grindelwald might actually have it?"

Her face twisted, her expression darkening. "If the wand really does exist --- which I still think is unlikely --- I'd say there's a better than not chance that Grindelwald has it. Why?"

Harry swallowed a lump in his throat. "The thought of him has been bothering me more lately. I think it sunk in a bit when I went back to Diagon Alley." Half of that was true. *It's not like I can tell her the real reason is because I realized how different this timeline is.* If Grindelwald had the most powerful wand of all time, was it possible he really could beat Dumbledore?

"Back to Diagon Alley?"

*Oh, right...* "I was there during the attack before my fourth year. It's one of the things that motivated me to start duelling."

Emily leant forward, eyes narrowed. Harry shivered. It was like that night she had cornered him; he felt like he was being stalked all over again. "How skillful were his men?"

"Not very. Slughorn dealt with a few of them by himself."

"Better or worse than some of the people you duelled last year?"

Harry pondered, caught off guard by the question. "Not as good as you, and probably not as good as Cassiopeia or Dolohov, but definitely better than the rest." Harry studied her face. "You really hate him."

"I hate anyone who would risk our world the way he does. He must be stopped; our society and our freedom may depend on it."

"The ICW getting to his bases sounds like a good sign."

"Maybe. It's impossible to say until we see what he does next." Her expression smoothed. "You have patrol tonight, right?"

*Does she just memorize everything?* "Yeah, first time."

"Would you like company? My homework is done, but I slept too poorly last night to practice anything advanced."

"Sure. I'm supposed to do the upper floors." Harry started towards the stairs but jumped when he felt her light touch on his sleeve. "What?"

"There's a faster way." She turned towards the wall, etched with a hundred serpentine carvings that had faded with time. **"Open."** She beckoned Harry inside the passage that had just appeared, smirking at his expression. "See? There are perks to trusting me."

***The Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom***

***1:10 PM***

A hush filled the classroom when the bell rang and it took Harry a moment to realize why. *Oh, right, Merrythought retired last year.* He cast his mind around, searching for anything he knew about their new professor. *I know his name is Holmes.* Someone had also mentioned something about him being an ex-auror.

Harry glanced around the room. Magical beasts snarled from inside weathered frames on one wall, while on another, charts depicted a variety of curses and their counters. *Ex-auror checks out.*

The classroom door opened and the man himself stepped inside, wearing plain black robes that matched his thinning hair. Harry watched the way he limped towards the desk. *Ex-auror definitely checks out.*

The professor stared out at them. "Curious, are you?" he asked, looking down at his bad leg. "Let's get any questions out of the way." The class sat in silence. "Well?"

"Did you really fight in the Great War?" asked Romulus Lestrange.

"I did."

"And you were an auror?" Marianna asked.

"I was."

Emily raised her hand. "How recently did you serve, Professor?"

A smile crept across Holmes's face. "That's better. Those types of questions are what will give you real information. I served until about three years ago."

"Have you ever crossed paths with Grindelwald or his men?"

"I have."

"What was he like?" asked Mulciber.

"Dangerous."

"Can he really fight dozens of aurors at a time?"

"Depends who you believe."

"What's it like fighting in battles like that?" Rosier asked.

"Dangerous."

Students were exchanging looks, many of them frustrated. *It's some sort of test, and they're not passing.*

Emily leant forward, eyes wide and lips pursed. *She wants something.* "Can you tell us about it, sir? The war has been making some of us nervous."

Holmes eyed her, clearly unfooled, but he answered anyway. "I won't spend the class lecturing you about Grindelwald, his men, and what it's like fighting them. There are plenty of reports you can read on that sort of thing, most of them are public. I'll say this about the war, and then we'll move on. I never had this limp before fighting that last battle against him and his men, and I planned on serving until the war ended, not teaching back home in a classroom."

The class remained quiet. "Auror recruiting is higher than ever and the force is grateful. I'm here to help prepare anyone who's worried about the war, but I won't sugar coat it and I won't make fighting it sound appealing. The war is dangerous and people are dying fast. Grindelwald is a monster unlike anything the world has seen in centuries and he's not slowing down. It will take an exceptional effort to end the war and Grindelwald will never concede so long as he is alive and free."

The room's temperature dropped, or so it felt. Having Holmes there was surreal. Harry looked around at his classmates, noticing how many faces were pale. *They're realizing this war might not end soon.* It would be almost another two years unless something had changed since his arrival and Grindelwald, Dumbledore, or another major player accelerated their plans.

"I think that's enough story time for now," said Holmes, waving his wand and summoning the attendance. "I don't like teaching without examples and explanations, so I'm sure you'll learn more the longer this class goes."

Harry pondered while Holmes read off names. Many of his classmates looked downtrodden, but he could not help but be excited. Merrythought had been a diligent teacher and had done well teaching them spells and how to duel, but Holmes was different. He was a man who had fought and survived the worst of the worst; there were things he could teach that no one else could.

***Albus Dumbledore's Office***

***8:30 PM***

"Ah, Harry, come in." Dumbledore smiled as he crossed the threshold, beckoning to the chair across his desk. "How was your summer?" he asked once Harry had sat.

"It was good, Professor, at least once my friends recovered."

"Ah, yes. How is their recovery coming along?"

"Good for the most part, but there are still some symptoms." Harry swallowed a mouthful of foul-tasting spit. "They sometimes still feel like they're being tortured right before they fall asleep and things like that."

"Cruelty leaves lasting scars," said Dumbledore. "Some are easier to heal than others, but let us hope they make a full recovery."

Harry chose his next words carefully. "How about you, sir? How was your summer?"

"Busy and not without stress. I count myself lucky to have returned this September."

Harry's pulse quickened. "Returned from where, sir?"

"Germany, if certain people had their way. It's startling how many people I've never met who are willing to conscript me for a war I want no part of."

Harry let out a short breath. "So they want you to fight Grindelwald?"

"And generally aid the allied forces, yes."

Sweat coated Harry's palms. "And you're not interested."

Dumbledore drummed his fingers on the desk, a far-away look in those deep, blue eyes. "I'm not so uninterested now as I was a year ago, but my place is here, not out fighting. I am a scholar, not an auror."

*If anyone knows more than Emily, it will be him.* "Professor... have you heard the rumours about him?"

"About whom?"

"Grindelwald."

Dumbledore sighed. "You'll have to be more specific, I've heard more rumours than I could ever hope to count."

"They say he has the most powerful wand ever and that it's what's making him so dangerous."

Dumbledore's expression darkened, but only for a heartbeat. "The Elder Wand," he mused, voice odd. *It's almost like he sounds bitter.* "If it exists at all, he may have it. Grindelwald has always shown an interest in ancient and obscure magic."

"Can he be beaten if he has it?" Harry made himself look down at the desk. "Sorry, sir, I've just been getting more nervous with the rumours that he'll move against Britain."

"I grow less sure by the day that he'll ever strike our shores. I was confident he would following his defeat in Stalingrad, but not now." Dumbledore adopted a gentle smile. "I wouldn't stress, Harry. There are few places in the world more well-protected than Hogwarts. Grindelwald would have a very difficult time breaching the castle, with or without the Elder Wand."

Harry looked up, making himself fidget. "What about my question, Professor? If you don't mind?"

"Hm?"

"Can he be beaten if he has the wand?"

"Oh yes, any man can fall. It is said Emeric the Evil once wielded that wand, along with Egbert the Egregious and a dozen other names you might recognize. All of them lost their power then died in the end, whether they really held the wand or not. Grindelwald is no different. It will take an extraordinary effort to beat a man of his skill, but it can be done. It will be hard, but there are always good men willing to do what is right instead of what is easy."

*I wonder if he thinks not fighting Grindelwald is right. It's weird he waited so long; I never knew how bad things got during the war.* "Thank you, sir."

"It is my pleasure," said Dumbledore, leaning back in his chair. "I believe we met for a different purpose than discussing Grindelwald until my skin thins and my hair greys."

"Right." Harry had been surprised to receive the letter from Dumbledore asking if he wanted to continue their lessons. "I'm a bit confused about that, sir. I'm happy and grateful, but what else is there to learn? Isn't it just applying the principles in different ways?"

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "Oh, I think there's still a thing or two. Now that we are no longer restricted by the confines of a curriculum, I think we can begin pursuing Transfiguration's true beauty and hone in on the parts that most interest you."

Harry grinned, unable to hold in his excitement. *I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds like this might actually be a good year.*
