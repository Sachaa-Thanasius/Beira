***A Rock in the Sea***

***11:56 PM***

Perched haphazardly in the vast, churning sea, a small, barren rock lay exposed and helpless to the infinite power of the world around it. It lay bare to the elements which often sought to ravage it, as well as any who were unfortunate enough to be occupying the rock in question at that most inopportune time.

Around this small refuge, the sea stretched out as far as the eye could see, displaying its vast power by crashing forcefully against the island\'s side, as if it were trying to capsize it like a helpless canoe caught in the ruthless grasp of a vengeful current.

Situated on the rocky and remote island was a small, rickety shack. The wind brutally tore across the island, making the lone shelter shake. Between that and the surging waves occasionally crashing against the island with such force one might think it would be pulled under at any moment, it really was a wonder the shack still stood at all.

The dilapidated shack hardly gave the impression of sanctuary, and it would be apt to think someone criminally insane for going anywhere near it, let alone seeking refuge within the structure that seemed poised to fall at any moment.

The last people one would ever expect to see in such a structure were a rather well-off family who prided themselves on being perfectly normal. They were, in their opinion, the very pinnacle of what the sophisticated section of Britain\'s upper-middle-class should look like.

Oh, and their nearly eleven-year-old nephew.

He was... not quite so normal.

Even now --- whilst doing nothing that would truly be called out of the ordinary --- the small, bespectacled youth lying on the hard, moisture-soaked floor of this ravaged shack stood out from the picture of uniform normality his relatives always tried to put forth. The three of them were all fast asleep, with the parents in the bedroom while their obese, blond-haired son occupied the cramped confines of the only couch in this out-of-the-way place.

This boy, on the other hand, was very much awake.

His intense green eyes were wide open as he peered around the dark interior of the shack, reminiscing on a great number of things as thunder shook the island he rested upon, chasing the flashes of lightning that lit up the otherwise pitch--black sky. They seemed as bright in the night as ethereal camera flashes.

Harry Potter felt the island shake and he could imagine the way the jagged lines of electricity lit up the sky outside, but he wasn\'t focusing on any of that. He was actually doing an admirable job of ignoring it --- though to do so completely would have been impossible.

Most of his attention was currently focused on something much more mundane than the unusually fierce storm raging outside, a fact his relatives may have actually been quite proud of had they not detested this boy as much as they did.

Most of Harry Potter\'s attention was focused on the small watch stretched to its breaking point on his cousin\'s fat wrist. In particular, the way both its hands ticked towards the number twelve at a pace so slow it physically pained him. When they reached the offending number, Harry Potter would no longer be ten years old. He would be eleven; and there was a small, naive part of him that liked to wish everything would change with the shifting of his age, even though he knew such thoughts were foolish and wishful.

Harry thought it reasonable to say he had never been particularly fortunate, and he couldn\'t see how the changing of his age might break that trend --- as much as he wanted to believe it was somehow possible.

At a year old, Harry had lost his parents to a car crash and been left on the doorstep of his relatives, who would later become constantly neglectful and occasionally abusive.

From an unreasonably early age, he was forced to take on all sorts of tasks around the house, some of which had been blatantly unsafe for a child of his age to partake in at all. He had been forced to rise early and then most of his day would be spent doing a vast number of things for his horrid relatives. The worst part of all, in Harry\'s opinion, was living in the cramped confines of the cupboard underneath the stairs.

He had always considered this last part to be needlessly cruel. His cupboard was terribly short on space, horribly uncomfortable, and not at all sanitary. The worst part of all was that his cousin Dudley had an entire spare room for his toys. Harry could have very easily slept in there, but the Dursleys had always viewed the cupboard as more than sufficient. In the often-vocalized opinion of his uncle, Harry should shut up, cease his moaning, and be grateful that they had taken him in at all.

For a long time, he had wished they hadn\'t.

He had desired nothing more than to be shipped off to an orphanage. For years, he naively believed the Dursleys to be exceptions as opposed to the norm. He had believed them to be the absolute worst of their kind, with no other possibly comparing to their cruelty and neglectfulness.

That belief had lasted until he started to regularly attend primary school.

Harry was a good student. He got stellar grades most of the time and did what he was told, keeping his head down along the way.

He had tried to make friends at first, but that hadn\'t lasted long. Dudley was surprisingly popular for reasons that Harry couldn\'t remotely comprehend. The boy had about as much brainpower as Uncle Vernon had neck. That was to say, none at all. Trying to hold a stimulating conversation with Dudley would have been as futile as attempting to outrun a cheetah. Impossible and a complete and utter waste of time, as well as possibly being detrimental to the health of any foolish enough to try.

Harry supposed his befuddlement over the situation mattered not. Dudley was much bigger than Harry, who was quite small for his age. On his own, Dudley was a handful at the best of times. With his posse of pandering followers who were almost as large and stupid as he was, Dudley was an absolute menace.

Not only did Dudley and his gang hunt Harry daily whilst at school --- doing their utmost to beat him to a pulp whenever they were able --- but they were shockingly effective in ensuring nobody came to his aid. No one wanted to cross Dudley or his gang. Therefore, no one wanted to befriend the strange, messy-haired youth who the group so often antagonized. The few children brave enough to break that unspoken rule had been made rather clear examples of, as had those who had picked Harry early when being team captains in PE or anything of a remotely similar nature.

This had been bad enough on its own, but what had been even worse was how the adults at the school had utterly failed him. They had ultimately turned out to be no better than the Dursleys; a fact that had been so crushing its oppressive weight was hard to describe.

None of the teachers went out of their way to help him and all of them sided with Dudley whenever they were presented the option. Perhaps if Harry had been a bit older and wiser, he might have considered the possibility of the Dursleys poisoning their perception of him from the onset. Unfortunately, at such an age, he hadn\'t thought with such rational clarity. It had only solidified his belief that he was alone and that no one was going to look out for him.

A belief that only grew stronger when strange, mysterious things had begun happening around him.

He hadn\'t been the slightest bit appalled when his teacher\'s hair had suddenly turned blue soon after falsely accusing him of cheating on a test on which he had earned a perfect score. What *had* appalled Harry had been the way she had somehow managed to blame it on him, landing him in trouble with the Dursleys in the process.

These odd instances had been yet another thing about his life. One that had not at all helped his living situation as the Dursleys detested anything odd. Harry personally thought they detested anything that was even mildly interesting, but that was a thought best left unsaid.

He had sometimes considered sneaking to the phone and calling the child services number he had heard mentioned on the television. He had never done so though, as every other adult he\'d ever known had failed him. They had still shown up once though.

Mrs. Figg, the old, odd cat-lady from across the way had called them, but they had failed just as Harry had feared they would.

They had been chased off quite easily by the Dursleys and had never returned. That had been one of the most severe punishments Harry had been subjected to, even though he hadn\'t done anything wrong.

He was actually quite surprised he hadn\'t been punished for his most recent escapade involving the boa constrictor at the London Zoo beyond time in his cupboard, nor for the hundreds of letters that had followed the Dursleys all across the country. All addressed in vivid green ink to a Master H. Potter.

Then again, he supposed being stranded on this desolate rock in this shell of a shack might have been punishment for many. It was certainly not comfortable, but at least it was interesting. It was far more stimulating than looking up at the dull underside of the Dursleys\' stairs, though not nearly as stimulating as the books he had frequented any time he was able to slip off to the library or sneak them into his cupboard, but he had never been able to count on those. In the last year or two, he was able to read much more frequently, but still not as much as he\'d liked.

The Dursleys monopolized most of that time, as did Dudley and his cruel group of friends.

*BANG! BANG! BANG!*

The thunderous slamming of something on the front door made the entire shack shake more than the ear-shattering claps of thunder had. Harry would likely have jumped so high he would have put his head through the boarded ceiling if not for the fact he was lying down.

He was understandably paranoid and hated sudden jolts.

How ironic that this sudden jolt would lead to his discovery of a mythical world of magic. One that might one day present him with the things he wanted above all else.

***Later that day, in Diagon Alley...***

By the time the afternoon began to age, Harry had resorted to numbly following in Hagrid\'s wake and remaining mostly silent. He was having far too much trouble processing all he had learned internally to focus too much attention and energy on vocalizing his thoughts and feelings externally.

They had just exited Flourish and Blotts and were presently trudging their way through the crowd. All the while, Harry was hoping beyond hope that he wasn\'t recognized again. The last thing he wanted was a repeat of the incident that had taken place earlier that day in the Leaky Cauldron.

He had found himself surprised to learn that he was obscenely famous. A fact he was blissfully ignorant about until late last night. Or, he supposed, early that morning; since it had been past midnight when Hagrid had ripped the door of the emaciated shack forcefully off its hinges and barged inside, revealing to Harry several incomprehensible truths that still had his mind reeling.

The most obvious of these truths was that he was a wizard.

All of the strange things that had happened around him and usually resulted in him landing in great trouble had been as a result of magic.

Apparently at his age, witches and wizards\' magic reacted harshly in certain situations. When magicians were particularly scared, thrilled, or upset, their magic would often react and manifest in a way that reflected their current mood. If they were suitably terrified, it might do its best to purge whatever it was that was terrifying them. If they were particularly cross with another person, it might lash out at that person.

That explained the blue hair, at least. Harry never had liked Mrs. Martin.

It explained a vast number of other things, too.

Like how he had shrunk the jumper Petunia persistently and fruitlessly tried to force him into when he was a great deal younger than he was now. How he had fixed a broken vase of Petunia\'s after being terrified of the repercussions he would face for inadvertently breaking it. It potentially explained how he had somehow set loose the snake at the zoo, and even how he had inexplicably appeared on a school roof one morning whilst fleeing from Dudley and his gang.

It had all been magic.

Magic was perhaps his new favourite thing in the world, despite the trouble it had landed him in numerous times over the course of his life.

It was due to his magical abilities that he would be escaping the Dursleys for ten full months come September. It was through magic that he had already decided he would no longer be vulnerable. Through magic, he would learn to ensure the Dursleys, or anyone else for that matter, wouldn\'t be kicking him around like a football.

Though, for all of its wonders, even magic seemed to have its evils, for it was no mere car crash that killed his parents.

No, they had died at the hands of a dark sorcerer. One the likes of which the British isles had not seen for centuries. A dark sorcerer who waged war on the entire nation through his bid for power; one whose name people up and down the country supposedly still feared speaking.

An odd name too, Voldemort. Rather... wizard-ish, Harry supposed; certainly not a name he had ever heard before that morning.

This man had supposedly decided to kill his parents when they had allegedly refused to join him. Just like all before them, they had fallen to Voldemort\'s might, but he had apparently failed to kill Harry --- then just an infant --- which made absolutely no sense to the youth in question.

It obviously made no sense to anybody, since no one had yet deduced exactly how Voldemort\'s curse had failed.

It was such a miraculous mystery that it was in fact the exact reason Harry was famous in the first place.

The Boy-Who-Lived, they called him.

Harry found this utterly ridiculous, but it was far better than anything he had experienced at Privet Drive, so he wasn\'t going to complain.

Complaining had never gotten him far in the past.

Since all of these revelations that morning, Harry\'s mind had been racing with questions and filled with unquenchable curiosity. Unquenchable curiosity that led him to purchase not only the standard array of Hogwarts-required books, but a small number of them for his own personal consumption. He would have to find some way of sneaking all of these into his cupboard, but he would manage.

Their next stop was a well-decorated shop that apparently sold every variety of robes, cloaks, and other wizarding attire that a person could ever need.

\"Listen, Harry,\" said Hagrid, wearing a sheepish expression that did not at all fit a man of his imposing size and stature. \"Would it be alright\' fer me to duck off \'n grab meself a quick pick-me-up at the Leaky Cauldron? Thought I\'d stay with yeh fer Flourish \'n Blotts, but them damn Gringotts carts do me stomach in every time.\"

Harry felt a large amount of nervousness rise like an elevator in the pit of his stomach at the prospect of being left alone; especially so soon after his entrance into a world which he was still vastly ignorant of. Yet, his immediate reaction was still to assure Hagrid that such a thing was perfectly acceptable and that Harry would manage just fine without him.

The bell chimed softly as Harry stepped through the door. As if she had been waiting for a signal, a rather well-dressed woman quickly bustled her way over to Harry, appraising him kindly as she did so.

\"Hogwarts, dear?\"

Harry nodded shyly in return. \"Yes, ma\'am.\"

She smiled at him. \"Right you are. There\'s another young boy getting fitted in the back, if you\'ll follow me.\"

Harry did just that and she led him to the back of the shop where several stepping-stools stood ready and waiting. Standing atop one of these stools was a fairly tall boy with perfectly slicked, platinum-blond hair. When Harry clambered onto the stool beside him, he could make out the boy\'s well-defined countenance and his cool grey eyes.

\"Hello,\" said the boy, \"Hogwarts, too?\"

\"Yes.\"

\"My father\'s next door buying my books and mother\'s up the street looking at wands,\" said the boy. He had a bored, drawling sort of voice. \"Then I\'m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don\'t see why first years can\'t have their own. I think I\'ll bully father into getting me one and I\'ll smuggle it in somehow.\"

Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley, something that did not immediately ingratiate this boy to him. Then again, he was considerate enough to at least speak with him, which was far more than he could say for his oaf of a cousin; who only spoke with Harry when it was a necessary component of whatever form of torment the large boy had planned.

\"Have you got your own broom?\" the boy went on.

\"No,\" said Harry.

\"Play Quidditch at all?\"

\"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.

Well, he supposed it logically must have been a game or sport of some sort --- since people apparently \'played it\' --- but that hardly narrowed it down.

\"I do --- Father says it\'s a crime if I\'m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\'ll be in yet?\"

\"No,\" Harry answered again, looking anywhere but at the boy beside him.

\"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they? I know I\'ll be in Slytherin --- all our family have been. Imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\'d leave, wouldn\'t you?\"

\"Now, now, Draco,\" said a calm, cool voice from behind them, \"no need to take shots at the poor \'Puffs. What have they ever done to you?\"

The voice --- which sounded a mix of amused and lightly chiding --- apparently belonged to a girl who appeared to be a few years older than either Harry or the boy stood beside him. He supposed the boy\'s name must be Draco, judging by this girl\'s address.

He got a good look at her a second or two later when she stepped out from behind them and instead chose to stand at their front. She was quite a bit taller than either Harry or Draco. She had the same coloured hair as the blond beside Harry, though hers was long, silky, and flowed elegantly down her back. Her eyes were grey as well, but not exactly the same shade as the boy who Harry was quickly realizing could be nobody but this girl\'s little brother. They were several shades brighter and had a bluish sort of hue to them, whereas Draco\'s were darker and purer in their colouration.

The boy beside Harry made a face at her. \"What does it matter?\" he asked. \"It\'s not like I\'ll be in Hufflepuff, anyway.\"

\"Things aren\'t always that simple,\" the new arrival said patiently. \"There are plenty of important people in Hufflepuff, even if you\'re not one of them. You would do well not to offend all of them as soon as you meet.\"

Draco turned a rather obvious shade of pink and the girl now turned her attention to Harry. This was odd, as Harry could never remember a time when an older girl had ever spared him anything more than a passing glance.

Her stare swept quickly over his battered, second-hand robes before slowly roaming up over his face. He thought he saw her eyes widen for a fraction of a second and he immediately feared she had discovered him.

But a rather polite smile was plastered on her face as she properly addressed him for the first time.

\"I\'m sorry if my brother came off a bit... brash. He\'s excited to start Hogwarts, as you can obviously tell.\"

\"That\'s... okay,\" Harry answered, having to scramble for the words, surprised that this conversation was taking place at all.

Her smile widened and she held out her hand; still standing on the floor in front of where Harry was just now getting the finishing touches put on his robes.

\"I don\'t think my brother ever introduced himself, so let me fix that. I\'m Diana Malfoy, Heiress of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Malfoy. This is my little brother, Draco. He\'ll be starting his first year at Hogwarts in September.\" Harry hesitantly took her offered hand with the air of somebody holding something particularly intriguing that might explode at any moment. \"What\'s your name, if you don\'t mind me asking?\"

There was a pause of about three seconds during which Harry seriously considered refusing to answer or giving a fake name. He quickly decided against either, as the first would be rude and the second would necessitate him coming up with a fake name --- something he was entirely too fatigued to bother with right now.

\"I\'m Harry. Harry Potter.\"

Diana\'s eyes narrowed with a look he had seen from the Dursleys many a time. A look they often wore right before accusing him of something. He couldn\'t ponder on it for long, though. He almost fell off the stool as the woman finishing up with his robes suddenly stabbed him painfully with the pin.

\"Gah!\" he exclaimed, only saved from falling by the girl in front of him reaching up and placing a brief, yet steadying hand on his shoulder. It made him tense, but it was gone so fast it hardly mattered.

\"I\'m terribly sorry, dear!\" the woman behind him exclaimed, hastening to apologize for her error. \"It\'s just... well, I was ever so surprised, you see?\"

\"Are you really Harry Potter?\" Draco Malfoy asked from beside him, stepping down off his own stool and gazing at Harry with much more interest than he had shown before.

Harry had to forcefully resist the urge to shrink back as irrational thoughts of retreating to his cupboard made themselves known at the corners of his mind.

This was not the time for nonsense like that.

\"I am, yes,\" answered Harry, looking down at the floor once more.

\"I\'m sorry if I came across as rude,\" Draco said hastily. \"You caught me on a bit of a long day, is all. Sorry if I said anything that upset you.\"

This baffled Harry more than anything else.

He wasn\'t sure if anyone had ever apologized to him in all of his life. If they had, he certainly couldn\'t remember it happening.

\"Don\'t mention it,\" he returned with a small smile, stepping off the stool as he saw Hagrid approaching down the street from out the large, front window. \"You didn\'t say anything that offended me.\"

\"Good,\" said Draco, noticeably relaxing as he held out his own hand to Harry. \"I hope we can talk more at Hogwarts then?\" When Harry slowly nodded, he smiled.

\"You can always owl, too,\" Diana reminded them.

\"Um... I\'m new to all this,\" Harry admitted reluctantly. \"How does that work, exactly? Do I need to write an address, or...\"

Draco looked about as stunned as if somebody had just punched him in the face, but Diana rested what looked to be a firm hand on his shoulder before he could speak; taking it upon herself to do so in his place.

\"There\'s no need for an address, no. Just write the name of the person you want the letter to get to. The owl will find them; they always do.\" She smiled warmly at the way Harry\'s shoulders seemed to sag in relief as all tension ebbed immediately out of his body. \"If you have any questions over the summer, we would be happy to help. Just write a letter to Draco or I, and we\'ll write back to you as soon as we can.\"

\"You\'re... sure?\" Harry asked with wide eyes, blown completely away by the sudden kindness shown to him by a complete and total stranger.

Two of them, even.

She smiled at him once more. \"Of course. It\'s no trouble at all. There\'s no reason you shouldn\'t get help if you need it, and I\'d be happy to be of assistance. Draco too, I\'m sure.\"

\"Of course,\" Draco said primly, straightening his posture and looking extremely modest. \"I say,\" he said, nodding towards the front window, \"Look at that man!\" Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\'t come in.

\"That\'s Hagrid,\" said Harry, oddly pleased to know something this Draco Malfoy didn\'t. \"He works at Hogwarts.\"

\"Oh,\" Draco hummed, \"I\'ve heard of him. He\'s a sort of servant, isn\'t he?\"

\"He\'s the gamekeeper,\" said Diana, glancing out of the window with a rather puzzled-looking expression. \"Why he would be here doing... that, I have no idea.\"

\"He\'s my escort,\" Harry explained. \"He\'s the one who took me here and is showing me around.\"

Again, Diana jumped into the conversation just as Draco was opening his mouth. His face flushed, but he didn\'t comment on it.

\"That\'s strange. If you only just found out about the magical world, it should be Professor McGonagall escorting you --- she teaches Transfiguration and is the Deputy Headmistress.\"

Harry shrugged, having no real idea how best to respond to that. It wasn\'t as if he could answer her unasked question.

\"You had better get back to him, anyway,\" Diana continued, looking back towards Harry as opposed to out of the open window. \"He seems a bit... impatient. Just remember, you can write us anytime you need.\"

\"Thank you,\" said Harry, sharing one last smile with the two siblings before thanking the shopkeeper, taking the bag of robes she offered, and striding out the door before rejoining Hagrid on this odd, magical journey.

From a ways down the street, a tall, well-dressed man with long, luscious hair watched the retreating forms of a hulking, rough-looking man and a much smaller, raven-haired boy with great interest.

Interest that only mounted when his son and daughter exited the same store that the black-haired youth in question had just left himself. Interest that swelled still more when his two children cast furtive, meaningful glances in the boy\'s direction while conversing in low, hurried whispers.

Yes, Lucius would most certainly be inquiring about all of this.

**Author\'s Endnote:**

**I won\'t go on for too long about this story, because I have an entire blog on my website in which I do just that. Just find my website through a basic google search, or through my profile, scroll down to blogs, and click the PoP release blog if you want more details.**

**I will, however, give some bullet points:**

**If any of you expect this to be anything like my story Ashes of Chaos, just curb all of those expectations right now. That is a story where I make massive changes to Harry\'s character from the onset and write ridiculously vast and admittedly over the top arcs. This is going to be my take on a realistic dark Harry. This is very much how I think Harry could have gone down a path of darkness if the series was geared towards adults instead of children.**

**There are some AU changes --- such as the inclusion of Diana Malfoy --- but Harry starts off very much the same as his canonical counterpart. No godlike wandless magic at the age of six or anything of the sort. There is a political side of this story and yes, heirs and lords will be mentioned. I can assure you, however, that there will be no eleven-year-old politicians or any such nonsense. If Harry ever enters that field, it will be years from now.**

**This is very much a slightly more jaded, slightly more well-read canon Harry in Slytherin. My goal with this fic is to really make it feel real. As a result, the years will all be subject to reasonable, novel-length pacing. By example, book 1 is 13 chapters and 86k words. It should be noted though that all years will be posted under this same story on FFN.**

**Year 1 will follow canon more closely than any other. After year 1, it will diverge fast; but again, it will do so with what I hope is a degree of gritty realism.**

**Chapters will be posted on FFN and AO3 every Sunday and Wednesday until the end of each book. At that point, there will be a significant delay between years, and then posting will continue at the same pace. This story will also be posted in audio form on YouTube and Spotify once the audio gets edited, just at a slower rate.**

**Obligatory warning right here that this story is rated M for a reason. There will be very mature themes, language not suitable to young audiences, and occasionally scenes of an especially graphic manner. I will also say right now that the actions of my characters are in no way reflective of myself as a person. I am warning everyone upfront that this story gets *dark.***

**You have all been warned and I hope you all enjoy.**

**Chapter 2: Finding the Path**

***September 1, 1991***

***King\'s Cross Station***

***10:41 AM***

Nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the first morning of September. Nothing even seemed particularly interesting or exciting, if truth was to be told.

The sky was a deep, dull grey; casting a gloomy veil across Great Britain. It personified the moods of the many muggle children who would soon be returning to school. The clouds seemed to lament the fast-approaching start of a new week; along with the country\'s older population as well, who would, come Monday, be returning to the uniform drone of work.

It wasn\'t even as though the clouds brought with them the promise of a storm, the existence of which would have at least been far less dull than the pointless sense of gloom currently presiding over the nation. All they brought was the promise of a dull, dreary day that would likely be draining for any residing far beneath them.

This is what a casual observer would have believed.

It was actually what the vast majority of the population thought, but a small, select group of beings thought quite differently about this day --- despite the seemingly dreary monotony of the sky.

For this very select group of rather abnormal individuals, this day meant the start of something truly special, no matter what the heavens might have reflected, particularly for those who hadn\'t yet experienced the majesty of this day.

Even more so in the case of a small, thin boy pushing a trolley that looked altogether too heavy for him as he did his best to discreetly weave through the whirring masses that occupied London\'s major train station.

For Harry Potter, this day not only meant the start of a magical journey that he would never have imagined five weeks ago; it also meant the escape from a far less than magical prison, one he had dreamed of escaping since he had first understood what dreams even were.

He wasn\'t actually sure which delighted him more. The thought of learning the awe-inspiring things he had spent most of his waking moments reading about over the last month, or escaping a hellacious life that he had always believed to have been inescapable.

That life had been slightly less hellacious over the month that had just died a peaceful death, but it was still one he very much wanted to escape from.

Harry had returned from Diagon Alley late in the evening on his birthday to some unexpected changes at his relatives\' home.

Uncle Vernon had not been furiously awaiting his arrival, as Harry had feared might be the case. In fact, he barely even saw his uncle or his aunt over the next month. They hadn\'t retracted their decision to give him Dudley\'s spare bedroom, much to their son\'s displeasure. They had even allowed their estranged nephew to spend as much time as he wanted in his new room, only interrupting his solitude to pass him meagre amounts of whatever meal they had eaten.

Many eleven-year-old boys would have been disheartened by this lack of human interaction, but Harry found himself in awe at his sudden dose of good fortune. No interaction with the Dursley family had ever been a positive one, and he was more than happy to be left completely to his own devices --- not to mention they had lifted the preposterously long list of chores off his shoulders.

Harry wasn\'t given anything special to pass the time, but he\'d hardly needed more than he had. He had made excellent use of the quiet and spent much of his days nose-deep in textbooks. He wasn\'t one of those child prodigies from the news who could immediately devour tomes as if they were crumpets, but by the time September the first had come around, he thought he had a strong grasp on the first-year material.

More so in Transfiguration and especially in Defence Against the Dark Arts. Those were the subjects that interested him most and they were the subjects he poured the most time into. History was another one he frequented, both to hopefully cure his vast ignorance of the magical world and because he found it genuinely interesting.

When he wasn\'t reading, he had been writing to Draco and Diana.

The latter often recommended him more books to read, which he would owl order from Flourish and Blotts --- after being informed that was indeed a thing that wizards did. All of the books Diana recommended were more culturally centred. They would be the books that would hopefully help him better adapt to the world he was entering.

He found the absurd amount of etiquette exhausting and he knew there was no hope he would ever have it all memorized by September 1st. Diana had been a great help there, pointing him in the direction of the more essential bits he needed to get down and informing him which passages could be left for a much later date.

She had been exceedingly helpful, and she very well may have saved him from a particularly embarrassing spot of trouble that might have otherwise arisen at King\'s Cross Station.

Harry had asked Uncle Vernon for a drive into London only days before he was set to catch the Hogwarts Express. His uncle had grunted in compliance and asked to see exactly which platform Harry would be boarding the train from. He\'d then taken savage pleasure in ruthlessly mocking the idiocy of wizards, pointing out that there was no such thing as a platform numbered \'nine and three quarters.\'

Harry had been forced to grudgingly concede he had a point and hurriedly wrote to Diana. She was a Hogwarts third year --- as she had told him in a previous bit of correspondence --- so this wouldn\'t be her first time through the process.

Her return letter made Harry equal parts relieved and nervous.

Relieved because he had indeed gotten the answer he had so desperately needed, and nervous because Diana was asking him to walk face-first into a stone wall.

That did not sound at all appealing, even if it was supposed to allow him to pass straight through. What would happen if the enchantment failed? Harry had no idea if an enchantment could even fail, but it had been a concern that had quickly risen to the forefront of his mind.

Diana seemed to have found his concerns quite amusing, but she had sent him a book to dissuade his worries, as well as where in the book to look. According to *Hogwarts, A History*, the platform had been fully operational for centuries. It mentioned no occasions on which it had ever failed, something that came as a small relief to Harry.

Not that it made walking straight into a wall any less daunting, but he supposed he would just have to manage.

His letters to Draco had been far more casual.

The youngest Malfoy had happily explained to Harry exactly what Quidditch was, and he had even sent him a copy of a book on the subject --- *Quidditch Through the Ages*. He had raved about not only flying, but other magical things in the wizarding world that he couldn\'t wait to introduce Harry to as well. He had also spoken very briefly about a few of his friends, but he hadn\'t given Harry a whole lot of details.

In his last letter, there had been a request for Harry to meet him on the platform. Draco said that he, his sister, and his parents would be waiting near the front of the Hogwarts Express, and he had warned Harry that the platform could be a bit of a madhouse if one waited until the last possible moment to arrive.

Harry had feared his uncle\'s spite might lead him to drop him off with just enough time to make it onto the Hogwarts Express. What he ended up finding quite amusing was that his uncle\'s unearthly desire to forever be punctual seemed more powerful than his dislike of Harry. The youth in question was dropped off with more than enough time to make it onto the platform, even while hauling the damned trolley that was far too heavy for his rather slight form.

Now, he stood just a short distance away from the barrier which was directly in front of him. To Harry, it did not look as though his path was unobstructed, though it very much was. His mind --- still hesitant to willingly walk head-first into a wall --- was playing tricks on him. It felt as though he stood at the foot of a towering precipice, one that was as steep as it was dangerous.

He closed his eyes and took a deep, centring breath, trying his best to ignore the way his own heart seemed to try and beat straight out of his chest, like a particularly rambunctious monkey pounding and rattling against the sides of the cage which held it captive.

Once his breath was finally under control, Harry opened his eyes with the air of one who had just come to terms with their fast-approaching execution after living in denial for many years. He marched forward quickly and got about halfway to the barrier before his walk became a run, so desperate he was to get the experience over with as fast as his short, knobby legs could carry him.

His heart rate quickened as the wall approached faster and faster, seeming to defy logic, for Harry could not imagine how the muscle\'s pounding could grow more intense. There was a split-second when he\'d traversed about two-thirds of the distance to the period in which he considered turning, slowing down, or coming to a full stop. The thought was brief though, and Harry marched on, shutting his eyes and praying to any higher deity that might exist that he didn\'t split his skull on the solid wall he would run into at any moment...

To his relief, he never did.

Passing through it felt odd, but not uncomfortable. Yet Harry knew at once that he had indeed passed through. His stomach dropped oddly as if he were in a speeding car racing down a steep incline.

His eyes snapped open as soon as he was sure he had crossed to the other side, and what he saw made his jaw hang slack until he managed to compose himself. He then proceeded to grin like a mad scientist whose latest experiment had yielded amusingly explosive results.

The platform was vast and open-aired, filled with people moving this way and that. Most of them appeared to be wearing what Harry thought looked to be traditional wizard robes, but there were more than a fair number donned in muggle attire that he found far more recognizable. A scarlet steam engine dominated the platform, standing proudly in the centre and drawing the attention of all, aided by the words *Hogwarts Express* emblazoned flamboyantly in gold upon its side.

Harry cast his eyes around the platform as he walked --- with no small bit of apprehension --- towards the front of the train, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Malfoy family.

They weren\'t exactly difficult to find.

Their features were distinct and their pale hair was quite eye-catching. Draco and Diana were already in robes, as were their parents.

One was a slim, beautiful woman with long, silky blonde hair that perfectly matched her daughter\'s. Harry imagined the blue hue in Diana\'s eyes came from this woman, for her eyes were a dark blue instead of the stormy grey of her son\'s and husband\'s. The man beside her had the stormy grey eyes that have already been mentioned and they only added to his imposing figure. He was tall and looked much like his son, but his hair was significantly longer.

It didn\'t take away from the intimidating image that was greatly aided by the serpentine cane he leaned on quite lazily. His relaxed demeanour only added to the air of power and danger that seemed to surround him. Everything about this man screamed power, but it did so nonchalantly and in a way that implied that he didn\'t need to go out of his way to be powerful, nor did he require effort to be dangerous. He was both of those things without effort, and that more than anything else was what did his image wonders.

The four of them were resplendent in royal-looking robes that were unmistakably of the highest quality money could buy, and all four sets of eyes belonging to the figures in question loomed ominously on Harry before he\'d even seen them; though he did not know this, of course.

\"Harry,\" Draco greeted pompously and with a small smile when the shorter boy slowly and cautiously crept his way into speaking range. \"How was the rest of your summer?\"

\"Not as exciting as yours, by the sound of it.\"

Draco\'s lips twitched upwards. \"Yes, well, not everyone can be me, I suppose.\" He turned towards the older figures, who were most certainly his parents, before looking back to Harry. \"Harry, this is my mother and father. The lord and lady of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Malfoy.\"

Harry waited for Lucius to greet him first. It was the proper decorum when meeting one who outranked you; to let them extend the offer of conversation, or to decide against doing just that.

From a hierarchical standpoint, the Potters and Malfoys were actually on even footing. They were both Ancient and Most Noble Houses, the second-highest rung of Magical Britain\'s complex political ladder.

The only rung higher was that belonging to the Founding Twelve families who were responsible for the founding of the Wizengamot nearly a thousand years ago, but most of those families were extinct or no longer relevant. Only a select few still remained.

Below them were Ancient and Most Noble Houses, which themselves were a rung above Ancient and Noble Houses, which sat atop both Ancient Houses and mere houses.

A house was a family on the Wizengamot that didn\'t meet any of the prerequisites for a higher designation. Any family could technically gain a seat, but they would need to pay the annual Wizengamot fees that were quite exorbitant, and they would need to do just that for five years to prove that they could reliably do so before their seat was granted.

Ancient Houses were families that had done this, but that had also lived within the borders of Great Britain for thirteen generations --- equating to roughly four hundred years. The two rungs above were for families who met this designation, but also ones who had a particular number of Order of Merlin recipients, Chief Warlocks, or Hogwarts Headmasters in their history. The number of any of these or a combination of the three could elevate an otherwise Ancient House to one of the next two rungs if the number itself was significant enough.

The Potters and Malfoys may technically have had equal status, but Lucius was a lord and Harry was only an heir. This was something that had confused him, but Diana had cleared it up in a letter. He was too young to be a lord, despite being the only remaining Potter alive. One day, when he inevitably took his seat on the Wizengamot, he and Lord Malfoy would be looked upon as equals, but that day had not yet come.

Draco\'s father waited a moment before stepping forward, extending a hand to Harry, who took it cautiously, mildly taken aback by the man\'s exceedingly firm grip.

\"Heir Potter,\" he greeted in a polished voice that seemed smoother than silk. \"It is such a great honour to meet you after all these years. Many of our kind have waited long and patiently for this opportunity.\"

Harry very nearly stumbled on his reply, but just managed to prevent it. He hardly imagined that would have gone far in making a positive first impression on one of the most important men in the country, not to mention one who intimidated him more than he would ever admit.

\"Thank you, Lord Malfoy. It\'s nice to meet you.\"

There was an odd spark in the man\'s eye, but Harry couldn\'t quite place it. \"It is a great pleasure to meet you as well,\" said Lord Malfoy, turning to his wife. \"I present to you my wife, the lady of our house.\"

Narcissa\'s hand was far softer to shake than her husband\'s, though her grip was just as firm. Her eyes seemed more searching than even those of Lucius, and she studied Harry in a way that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.

\"Lady Malfoy,\" he greeted with the utmost politeness.

Narcissa smiled a warm smile that had the effect of putting most subjected to it at ease. \"There\'s no need to be so formal, dear. We\'re family, after all.\" When she saw Harry\'s blank, puzzled expression, she suddenly looked solemn. \"Didn\'t you know?\" He shook his head, looking rather dejected. Narcissa tutted. \"It\'s hardly your fault, from what I\'ve heard. No matter --- we will have to remedy that in time. Your grandmother was Dorea Black, who just so happened to be my favourite aunt.\"

Harry felt his heart leap as too many butterflies for such a confined space seemed to try and force their way into his innards. \"Did-did you know my parents, too?\"

Narcissa frowned deeply. \"Not nearly as well,\" she admitted. \"I knew your father some, but we more so knew of each other than anything else. I know more about them than I knew them.\" She didn\'t fail to miss the way Harry\'s expression had begun to fall before suddenly lighting up at that last revelation. \"I would be happy to write you about them if you\'d like. I don\'t know a great deal, but I can tell you what I know.\"

\"That... yes, I\'d like that.\" Harry found speaking quite difficult, as his throat seemed oddly obstructed, but he managed to croak out those words nevertheless.

Narcissa smiled. \"Consider it done, and please do call me Narcissa. I hope you won\'t mind if I call you Harry, in return.\" He shook his head frantically, so dazed by the interaction that he hardly noticed her parting smile.

\"You three had best make haste,\" Lord Malfoy told Harry, Draco, and Diana. \"If you doddle for too long, there won\'t be any decent seats left. I won\'t have my heiress, son and their friend forced to sit with the common riff-raff.\"

Draco and Diana nodded, so Harry thought it likely a good idea to nod along. Lord Malfoy returned the gesture with his own, curt variant of it.

\"Good. Write to us often and behave.\" His eyes were fixed mostly on Draco, who nodded quickly to show he understood. \"Represent the Malfoy family with dignity and proper decorum at all times.\" His stare suddenly flicked towards Harry. \"If you require any assistance, Heir Potter, I am always welcoming owls from the likes of you.\"

\"Th-thank you, sir.\"

Lucius beckoned them all off and Harry struggled behind Draco and Diana, lugging his heavy trunk along with him. \"You didn\'t get one with a Featherlight Charm?\" Draco asked, clearly appalled by the very idea.

\"A what?\" asked Harry, having never heard of such things in his life.

\"Battered old thing, too,\" Diana observed, even though Harry thought the trunk looked quite pristine. \"We can help him get a better one when we\'re at Hogwarts,\" she told Draco. \"No doubt Hagrid never explained the right sort of things to get.\"

\"There are different sorts of trunks?\"

\"All kinds,\" Draco said with a wave of his hand. \"You\'ll want the best of the best, of course. Money shouldn\'t be an issue, being a Potter. You\'ll want the trunk with a password, Featherlight Charm, and Spatial Expansion Charm. You couldn\'t live in it or anything ridiculous, but it will give you plenty more room than *that*.\" He said the last word with noticeable distaste, and Harry suddenly felt far out of his depths compared to these two.

Diana discreetly withdrew her wand and tapped it on Harry\'s trunk. She muttered something in what sounded like Latin and the trunk really did become as light as a feather.

\"It\'s a third-year spell?\" asked Draco.

\"No, but Charms is by far my best subject.\" Diana offered Harry a kind smile. \"Don\'t let it bother you. It\'s not your fault you weren\'t properly informed. It will just be up to people like us to fix that.\"

\"Yes,\" said Draco, sounding rather smug about the whole thing. \"We\'ll make sure you get on with the right sort.\"

\"The... right sort?\"

\"Mhm, the right sort, yes. You\'ll learn pretty quickly that some families are much better than others.\"

This made perfect sense to Harry, for he had lived with the worst family imaginable. It was true that he didn\'t think at all fondly of muggles in general, and thought most of them likely not worth a bronze knut next to wizards as obviously kind as the Malfoys, but he knew some families to be better than the Dursleys. He could understand better than most that some folk were just far superior to others.

\"I\'ll stop in to see you two later,\" promised Diana when the three of them came to an empty compartment near the back, and the older girl gestured for the two younger boys to move inside. \"I\'m going to go see if any of my friends have arrived yet and save them a compartment if not.\"

\"Best of luck,\" Draco said as Harry hurriedly thanked her, listening to her fast-retreating footsteps as he and Draco took seats in the compartment after easily lifting their featherlight trunks into the overhead storage rack above.

\"I am not looking forward to this train ride,\" moaned Draco. \"It\'s going to be terribly long.\"

\"At least Hogwarts is at the end of it,\" said Harry.

\"True. A small mercy, that. I don\'t think I would be able to stand it otherwise.\" A silence stretched between them before the blond dared to ask a particularly bold question. \"Is it really true you\'ve been living with muggles?\"

Harry had told him so in one of his letters, but it seemed so unbelievable to Draco that he had to ask in person.

Harry sighed. \"Yeah, my aunt, uncle, and cousin on my mum\'s side.\"

Draco looked suddenly sympathetic. \"That must have been awful.\"

\"You have no idea,\" Harry muttered darkly.

\"Is that why you\'d never heard of Quidditch or Featherlight Charms?\" Harry nodded sorrowfully. Draco sneered. \"Leave it up to a bunch of worthless muggles to keep the heir of an Ancient and Most Noble House from knowing a thing about the world he belongs to. Scum, the lot of them.\"

Harry felt as though the morally proper thing was to disagree, but he couldn\'t find it within himself to do that, so he said and did nothing.

\"Don\'t worry, I\'ll make sure you get all caught up. So will my friends once you meet them.\"

\"Thanks,\" said Harry, looking anywhere in the compartment but at Draco. \"They... won\'t think badly of me for not knowing these sorts of things or anything?\"

Draco hesitated for a fraction of a second too long. \"I\'m sure it will be fine,\" he said after that very brief pause. \"While we\'re waiting though, it might not hurt to make sure you... have a few things straight.\"

Draco made sure Harry knew the definitions of muggleborn, halfblood, and pureblood before quizzing him on the basics of the four Hogwarts houses. Harry had answered all of this quickly, and then Draco went over a very brief summary of the political system that was earlier spoken upon before he, at last, seemed satisfied.

\"That should do,\" he decided with no small bit of satisfaction. \"Anything else, we can talk about later.\" His pale, pointed face curved into a broad smile. \"Care to see how wizard\'s chess works?\"

Harry was in awe of the magical pieces that moved on command without the need for their commander to lift so much as a finger. He hadn\'t had much experience with chess, so Draco beat him easily, but he found he was enjoying the game nevertheless and was improving with great speed.

Roughly ten minutes after the train had rolled out of Platform Nine and Three Quarters, there came a knock on the door.

A boy and a girl stood outside. The boy was taller than Harry but shorter than Draco. He wasn\'t quite as pale as the youngest Malfoy and had very dark eyes and medium-length brown hair. He had a guarded look about him and a more athletic-looking frame than either Harry or Draco. The girl beside him was a couple of inches shorter with shiny black hair, deep brown eyes, and a face that Harry cynically compared to that of a pug.

\"Pansy, Theodore,\" Draco greeted with a fond-looking smile.

\"Draco!\" exclaimed the girl whose name must have been Pansy. \"How was your summer? It\'s been ages since we\'ve last talked!\"

Draco rolled his eyes. \"Pansy, it hasn\'t been *that* long. We spent most of the day together on my birthday and the solstice.\"

\"Yes, but you\'ve been gone all of August and we never met up in July!\"

\"How was France?\" asked the boy called Theodore, whose dark eyes left Harry for the first time since entering the compartment. It was a relief they had, since they had practically been burning a hole into his face.

\"Well enough,\" said Draco. \"Not the first time I\'ve been there, of course. Mother is very fond of Paris.\"

\"Paris is wonderful,\" Pansy said dreamily. \"My parents took me for my birthday last year. They always told me when I turned eleven, they\'d take me anywhere I wanted.\"

\"Never been,\" said Theodore. \"Father has never been much of a traveller.\"

\"I don\'t reckon you have either, Harry?\" Draco asked, effectively drawing all attention onto the quietest of the gathered quartet.

Harry would have scoffed had the new pairs of eyes not made him so self-conscious. \"Never been out of Britain,\" he admitted quietly.

\"Who\'s this, Draco?\" asked Theodore, seeming to ignore the fact Harry was right in front of him and in a perfect position to be asked.

\"Oh, have I forgotten to introduce him?\" It was *very* clear to even Harry that was not the case at all.

Even he could tell that Draco had intentionally left this for the most opportune moment, better to get a reaction. This annoyed Harry, who really didn\'t want the attention, but he said nothing. He didn\'t want to upset Draco or to ruin his fun. It was harmless, really. It just made him uncomfortable, which he was quite adept at dealing with, so he remained quiet.

\"You have,\" said the boy with narrowed eyes and obvious suspicion.

Draco looked sheepish. \"Sorry, I must have gotten distracted.\"

Even without piecing together Draco\'s intentions moments earlier, Harry knew it was a lie. He could almost always tell when somebody was lying. It was one of the many strange things about him. People just couldn\'t seem to lie to him and get away with it. He could just... feel when they were hiding something and he usually had a good indication as to whether or not they were trustworthy.

\"Theodore, Pansy,\" Draco continued, and it was obvious by now he was exercising a great deal of effort not to grin like a fool. \"I\'d like you to meet Harry Potter, Heir of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Potter.\"

Nott\'s eyes widened as his jaw loosened and Pansy let out a loud, undignified squeak of surprise.

\"Harry,\" continued Draco, \"meet Pansy Parkinson, Heiress of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Parkinson.\"

\"So nice to meet you,\" the girl gushed hastily, all at once appearing to recover from the state of awe Draco had befallen upon her as she smiled broadly and extended her hand to Harry, who took it clumsily.

\"And Theodore Nott,\" Draco went on. \"Heir of the Founding House of Nott.\"

The Notts were one of the few remaining Founding Houses in Magical Britain, along with the Greengrasses, Longbottoms, Selwyns, and the Blacks. There were technically members of the Founding House of Lestrange still alive, but they currently called Azkaban prison home and were set to do just that until their final days had elapsed.

Theodore Nott didn\'t immediately extend a heartfelt greeting as Parkinson had a moment earlier. \"Why is he here?\" he asked Draco. \"Surely, th... he\'s one of Dumbledore\'s?\"

Harry had no idea what that meant, nor what he\'d originally been intending to say. It confused him greatly, but he stayed silent and trusted Draco to better speak on his behalf.

\"Relax, Nott. I met him in the alley and we\'ve been talking ever since. Harry\'s a good sort; he just has a lot of catching up to do.\"

\"Catching up?\"

Draco sneered. \"One of the reasons I doubt he\'ll have any love for Dumbledore. He was raised by muggles --- no doubt it was *the old fool\'s* idea.\"

\"MUGGLES!?\" screeched Pansy.

Draco just nodded solemnly. \"You can ask him yourself if you don\'t believe me. He is right there, you know.\"

\"Were you really raised by muggles?\" Nott asked with an interesting mix of disgust, skepticism, and something that Harry couldn\'t place. He nodded, and Nott\'s eyes narrowed once more. \"What did you think of them?\"

\"They were horrible. Worst people I\'ve ever met.\"

\"Just the ones who raised you, or others you met?\"

Harry thought about that. \"I\'ve never met a good one.\"

For a reason he couldn\'t entirely work out, Nott seemed to relax before offering his hand at last. \"Theodore Nott, like Draco said. Heir of the Founding House of Nott. I\'m not sure if you know what that means because of... muggles, but I\'m sure we can catch you up if you don\'t.\"

\"I do,\" Harry said, taking his hand and inclining his head.

Nott\'s eyebrows knit together. \"So you do know about our world?\"

\"Not really,\" Harry admitted, fidgeting. \"I only just found out I was a wizard in July. I\'ve just been reading all I can ever since. I\'m still miles behind.\" He suddenly looked down towards the floor as a horrible thought crossed his mind for not the first time in the past number of hours, days, or weeks. \"I have so much catching up to do. I always did pretty well in school, and I\'ve read over a lot of the first-year textbooks, but I\'ll probably be so far behind that I\'ll be one of the worst in the year.\"

\"Rubbish,\" Draco dismissed. \"You might start out a bit behind some of the purebloods, but you\'ll catch up. None of the muggleborns have ever used magic in their lives, and a lot of the halfbloods haven\'t either.\"

\"Even some pureblood families don\'t let their kids use magic,\" put in Pansy with obvious distaste.

\"Not any of our families, though,\" said Theodore Nott. \"We all know a bit, even if we haven\'t had much time to practice. If you\'re the right sort like Draco says, we\'ll help you catch up.\"

\"If you\'ve read a lot of the first-year books, I\'m sure you\'ll do fine,\" said Pansy. \"Even we don\'t know that much magic.\" Nott cleared his throat and she rolled her eyes. \"Okay, well Theodore\'s father showed him more than most purebloods learn, but I don\'t know very much magic at all. Just the theory and all about the world.\"

\"The same goes for me,\" agreed Draco. \"Father has taught me a few useful spells and Diana has shown me quite a few of them, but we all only just got wands back in July, too. Even if we know more magic, it doesn\'t mean we\'ve actually had enough time to practice it.\"

\"Point is,\" Nott summarized, \"you\'ll do fine, as long as you stick with the right sort.\"

Harry couldn\'t help but notice how often \'the right sort\' had been mentioned, and he didn\'t quite understand what it meant. He didn\'t much care though, for he was just relieved that all seemed to be going well.

He might just have found friends at long last, and friends who might even help him.

Perhaps all of this would go much better than he had ever imagined.

It was sometime later that the two final members of Draco\'s group joined them. These were the largest boys their age that Harry had ever seen. They would have made Dudley whimper and cower in fear. Their names were Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle; though they just went by Crabbe and Goyle, according to Draco. They were the friends Harry had heard about in the youngest Malfoy\'s letters, as they were the ones who joined him quite often in the sky on broomsticks for games of Quidditch --- a sport that sounded so magnificent Harry couldn\'t wait to see it.

After an hour or so had passed, the constant sprawl of buildings had vanished and the skyline had suddenly cleared. Now, they were speeding past vast fields that were blanketed in a myriad of brilliant autumn colours. From out the window of the speeding Hogwarts Express, it appeared as though the train was racing past immense and vibrantly painted patches of earth. The sight was made all the more lurid by the otherwise dreary look of the world brought on by the thick clouds high above, making the bright yellows and oranges stand out even more than they would have otherwise.

This all would have been quite breathtaking to Harry, but he was altogether more distracted by the conversation in the compartment. They talked endlessly of a great number of things, some of which he knew and some of which he didn\'t.

By the time their stomachs began to rumble, they had started playing poker, which Harry had absolutely no idea how to play.

Pansy was teaching him while Draco and Theodore played, and Crabbe and Goyle partook in a different, more enjoyable-looking game called exploding snap. Harry had been eager up until Draco had told him it was rather undignified, at which point he\'d sorrowfully given it up and began listening intently to Pansy explaining the rules of poker.

Apparently, some of the more illustrious families taught their heirs the game at a young age. It helped teach them to bluff, was how Theodore had explained it. Supposedly, bluffing was a major part of politics, not that Harry would have known such things.

The door slid open not long after this practice had begun and a rather plump woman with a kind-looking face stuck her head inside. \"Anything off the trolley, dears?\"

Crabbe and Goyle practically leapt to their feet and they were the first out the door. The other purebloods moved more carefully, with Harry bringing up the rear. For the first time in his life, he had actual money; and a fair amount of it, at that. He intended to buy as many Mars bars as he could carry.

But they didn\'t have Mars bars, and he found himself immensely confused by the perplexing collection of sweets that the trolly did carry.

\"Oh, I guess you\'ve never seen any of this, have you?\" Pansy asked as all the others crowded around the trolley and loaded their pockets with a bit --- or in the case of Crabbe and Goyle --- *a lot* of everything. Harry just shook his head. \"Here,\" said Pansy, \"I\'ll help you.\"

And so she did, explaining to Harry what everything was. He ended up taking a pile of Chocolate Frogs and some Cauldron Cakes, as they seemed most like the Mars bars he had been craving.

When he opened the Chocolate Frog, deftly snatching it from the air and consuming it in one bite, he eagerly withdrew the card that Pansy had told him would be inside.

The picture was of an ancient-looking man with long, silvery hair and beard, as well as deep blue eyes behind distinctive half-moon spectacles. As Pansy had told him, the small portrait was moving, which greatly fascinated Harry. What caught his eye just as quickly was the man\'s name, as he\'d heard it uttered by Draco and Theodore several times.

*Albus Dumbledore*

Intrigued, Harry read the short description below Dumbledore\'s twinkly-eyed portrait.

*Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Albus Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\'s blood, and for his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten-pin bowling.*

So this was the Dumbledore who Draco and Theodore spoke of. Odd how they seemed to speak so poorly of a man who seemed to be regarded so highly and who had seemingly done a number of great deeds.

But he had no doubt they knew far more than he, so Harry didn\'t ponder the matter long. He quickly went back to his mountain of chocolate and impromptu lesson in the art of poker.

The only other real thing of note that happened during the rest of the journey did not take place until several hours after Harry had learned of Albus Dumbledore.

It happened when the door burst open yet again, admitting a girl who was already dressed in her Hogwarts robes. One with perhaps the bushiest brown hair Harry had ever seen, as well as very distinctive teeth, some of which were too large and out of alignment.

\"Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville\'s lost one.\"

Pansy seemed to cringe at the mere idea of a toad, and Theodore sneered. Harry noticed that Theodore sneered quite a bit.

When none of Harry\'s new friends seemed inclined to answer, he did so himself. Somehow, he didn\'t find this girl nearly as intimidating as anyone else he\'d met that day.

\"We haven\'t seen one, sorry.\"

The girl deflated, but then her eyes fell on the chessboard still laid out and they lit up. \"Is that a magical chessboard? I\'ve heard they move on their own? Have any of you been doing any magic?\"

\"No,\" Theodore bit out tersely.

\"Oh, well, I\'ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\'s all worked for me. Nobody in my family\'s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it\'s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I\'ve heard --- I\'ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough --- I\'m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?\"

Dear Go --- wait! No... Merlin; magicals apparently said Merlin, Diana had told him.

Dear Merlin, this girl was... something.

Something Harry wasn\'t entirely sure he liked, but something nonetheless. He saw no need to flaunt the fact she had read some books. He supposed it was impressive if she really had memorized all of them, but it wasn\'t as if she had done something incredible.

\"People who don\'t want your company,\" Draco drawled in a tone that was shockingly condescending for an eleven-year-old.

She flushed pink and suddenly looked upset. \"There\'s no need to be rude---\"

\"Says the one who doesn\'t know how to knock,\" Theodore sniped. He had a point. Did nobody in this damned world of magic knock? First Hagrid and now Hermione Granger. \"What\'s the matter, Granger? Too busy memorizing textbooks to learn some manners?\"

That might have been a bit harsh, and Harry did feel a definite pang of guilt at the stricken look on Hermione Granger\'s face as she rushed from the compartment, but he didn\'t want to say that to his new friends, and she had been quite annoying.

Really, perhaps it was only right after she\'d barged into their compartment without warning and started flaunting how fast she could read, of all things.

\"That, Potter,\" said Theodore, \"is exactly what the wrong sort looks like.\"

It wasn\'t long after their confrontation with Hermione Granger that a voice came over the speaker and said they would be arriving at Hogwarts in five minutes. They all decided to use that time to change. Harry bowed out to do so in the bathroom; though he didn\'t say that exactly.

He had actually just said he\'d needed to use it for a while now. He was wearing robes, after all, just not his Hogwarts ones. He wanted to ensure they stayed pristine for the night\'s events, but he hadn\'t been willing to show off his usual attire. Thus, he had slipped on some basic wizarding robes in one of the train station\'s bathrooms. Underneath were his battered, second-hand rags. He didn\'t want his friends seeing those, and it terrified him to think how they might react to them. Especially after Draco\'s reaction to his trunk all those hours ago.

By the time he returned to their compartment, Pansy was back as well. All of them had been instructed to leave their luggage on board, so they were now just waiting for the train to come to a halt.

\"What house are you hoping for, Potter?\" asked Theodore, catching Harry a bit off guard.

He hesitated, not quite knowing how to answer, but Draco beat him to it.

\"He\'ll be a Slytherin, of course.\"

Theodore snorted. \"A Potter in Slytherin? That would be something to see.\"

\"No Potter has been sorted into Slytherin for centuries,\" Pansy explained when she saw the puzzled expression on Harry\'s face. \"They\'ve nearly all been in Gryffindor.\"

\"You don\'t want to be in Gryffindor,\" Draco pronounced matter of factly. \"They\'re all a bunch of reckless slobs who try and get themselves killed just so they can go brag about it to their friends.\"

Harry frowned. \"But my parents must have been Gryffindors.\"

This made Draco come up short, but it was Pansy who made the save. \"What Draco means is that *almost* all of them are like that. There are obviously a few here and there who have some sense, but most of them are rowdy simpletons.\"

\"Not to mention mudbloods and blood traitors,\" Theodore muttered. Harry had no idea what either of those things meant, so he stayed quiet, thinking of all the things his new friends had told him.

He supposed the house of the brave could lend itself to recruiting some rather rambunctious individuals. He could see how an entire house of people like that could be problematic if they were all stuck together.

He shuddered at what that house might look like if Pansy and Draco were right. He also didn\'t know the meaning of whatever Theodore had said, but the word \'traitor\' did not have positive connotations. He had already been betrayed by family in his opinion. The last thing he wanted was to be betrayed again.

And thus, Harry decided he didn\'t want to be in Gryffindor.

Soon, they had all exited the train.

The thick veil of clouds above had thinned; though it hardly mattered now, for it was by this point dark. The clouds that remained still did an excellent job of obstructing the moon, seeming to do their best to impede it every time it tried to beam its silvery light down onto the Earth below.

A booming voice called out to the first years, and they were all led to a fleet of boats by Hagrid, unmistakable and impossible to miss even in the dark gloom of this night. Harry could not help but notice the way Hagrid\'s face had twisted into an obvious look of concern when his dark, beady eyes had fallen upon him, as well as Draco, Theodore, and Pansy.

The four of them piled into a boat, leaving Crabbe and Goyle to find one of their own. They sailed across the eerily smooth surface of the dark, vast lake which carried them down into a sort of underground docking station.

Before that could happen, they caught their first glimpse of Hogwarts. Harry didn\'t even try to conceal his awe and wonder; he knew doing so would be fruitless.

The castle dominated the very sky, standing tall and imposing on the dark, high cliff they were about to sail straight under. In the velvety blackness, the castle was effectively camouflaged by the impenetrable night around it. It might have even gone relatively unnoticed that night, despite its size and grandeur, had it not been for the hundreds of lights shining from its many windows. Every one of them stood out on this dark, gloomy night, clashing with the darkness as starkly as a blinding supernova might against the all-consuming nothingness of a gaping black hole.

They drew the attention of all, casting the nearby bits of the castle into sharp relief so that they could make out its magnificent form, even on such a night.

Many of the first years thought the castle looked more like an impenetrable fortress built to stand against the sieges of vengeful dragons and vindictive deities as opposed to a boarding school built to house the best and the brightest witches and wizards of the United Kingdom. Not that the fact did anything to dim their excitement. It seemed only to amplify it as the children practically scrambled up the sloping grounds to the castle\'s towering, oak front doors.

Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked thunderously upon the door three times, prompting it to be opened not ten seconds later by a tall, thin woman in plain black robes. Harry thought she looked very stern and he immediately noted her as not being the type to cross if he could at all avoid it.

\"The firs\' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid.

\"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\"

The entrance hall was so vast, the whole of the Dursleys\' house could have fit inside of it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase that faced them led to the upper floors.

They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right --- the rest of the school must already have been present --- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small antechamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.

Professor McGonagall gave them all a rousing speech about the four Hogwarts houses and the mysterious sorting ceremony that awaited them.

Well, not so mysterious at all, since Draco quickly explained to Harry in a low whisper exactly how the students were sorted, which made a red-headed boy\'s ramblings about fighting a troll several minutes later all the more amusing.

The Deputy Headmistress temporarily left them after a not-so-subtle hint to look sharp in a few minutes\' time. She had definitely been glaring at the same red-head who\'d mentioned the troll, for he had an obvious smudge of... something on his long, distinct nose. Then again, that was better than the boy who had almost lost his toad. His cloak had been fastened under his ear. How he had ever accomplished such a thing, Harry would never know. It was oddly impressive, in a depressing sort of way.

Harry and many of the others got a horrible scare when numerous transparent beings, who were apparently ghosts, floated through the wall. Harry did think he remembered something about them in *Hogwarts, A History,* but he hadn\'t read a terribly large amount of that book yet. Only the relevant section about the barrier Diana had indicated, and some other miscellaneous passages here and there.

It wasn\'t long before Professor McGonagall returned and ushered the ghosts out of the antechamber. Harry tried hard not to gawk as they floated straight through the wall once more while he lined up and did his best to mentally prepare himself for what was to come.

He felt as though his legs had turned to lead as they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall proper.

Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table clearly designated for the professors

Professor McGonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars.

It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all and that the Great Hall didn\'t simply open onto the heavens.

Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool, she positioned a pointed wizard\'s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia certainly would never have let it in the house.

Harry thought it looked too battered to do much of anything, let alone sort them all into one of the four houses.

As if to prove him wrong, a brim on the ancient hat opened wide, and it began to sing a song. A song describing the houses in more flamboyant terms than McGonagall had just moments earlier.

The hat preached their values before bowing to each of the four tables and falling still once more. The last thing Harry heard before Professor McGonagall called the first name was the tall, gangly red-head cursing under his breath and promising to kill the older brother who had somehow gotten him to believe they would be fighting a troll.

People really were thick. Harry had been in the magical world for all of a month and even he wouldn\'t have fallen for that.

\"Abbot, Hannah!\"

Harry became distracted when the first name was called. A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat --- which fell right down over her eyes --- and sat down. A moment\'s pause\...

\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" the hat shouted.

The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table.

\"Bones, Susan!\"

\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" the hat shouted again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.

\"Boot, Terry!\"

\"RAVENCLAW!\"

The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.

\"Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers. Perhaps it was Harry\'s imagination, or perhaps all Draco and Theodore had said about the Gryffindors was playing tricks on his mind, but they looked like an awfully loud and rowdy bunch --- to the point of being overwhelming and borderline unbearable.

Harry shuddered; he liked his peace and quiet when he needed it.

\"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin, and Harry noticed their reaction was very polite, but a whole lot more subdued. This seemed more like a place he wouldn\'t mind staying, though much the same could be said for Ravenclaw, whose members had reacted in an equally acceptable way for their own new housemates.

He was definitely starting to feel sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during P.E at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.

And the sorting itself...

Merlin, what if he were sorted into Gryffindor? They didn\'t look his type and he had the oddest feeling he would immediately lose his newly-formed friendships. He didn\'t think he would be able to stand such a thing happening. It was the first time in many years he\'d had friends at all, and he didn\'t want to think how painful it would be to lose them so quickly and so suddenly.

He supposed Ravenclaw wouldn\'t be too bad, but the Hufflepuffs seemed to do a lot of hugging and touching to greet their new members. All of that was a very big no for Harry.

He began to notice the inconsistencies of the hat when it took several minutes to sort Hermione Granger into Gryffindor, yet Daphne Greengrass --- quite a tall blonde girl with icy blue eyes and soft, angelic features --- was sorted into Slytherin within thirty seconds of her donning the hat. Draco had gone to Slytherin before the hat had even touched his head, joining Crabbe and Goyle at the silver and green table.

Theodore was sorted almost as quickly as Draco, and Pansy didn\'t take much time, either. A pair of twins --- Patil and Patil --- were sorted next and then, at long last...

\"Potter, Harry!\"

As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.

\"Potter, did she say?\"

\"*The* Harry Potter?\"

\"Better be Gryffindor!\"

The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second, he was looking at the black inside of the hat.

He waited...

\'Hmm,\' said a small voice in his ear. \'Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind, either. Quite a great one, as a matter of fact, if it is just applied in the right way... yes, plenty of potential here. There\'s talent, ah, my goodness, yes --- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\'s interesting... So where shall I put you?\'

Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, \'Not Gryffindor, not Gryffindor---\'

\'Not Gryffindor?\' the hat asked in what seemed to be an utterly incredulous voice. \'Now *that* is most interesting of all things. A Potter not wanting to go to Gryffindor? I would have never thought I would see the day. Hmm... this makes things difficult. Are you quite sure not Gryffindor? It is the most natural fit, and it is by far your safest option. You would do very well there; of that, I have no doubt.\'

Harry thought about his parents very briefly and what they might think of him if he weren\'t sorted into Gryffindor. He crushed that thought quickly. If they wouldn\'t accept him no matter what house he landed in, they were no better than the Dursleys, which was a possibility he could not bear to consider. He had to believe they would have been accepting of any option.

\'Oh yes, your parents would have been most happy no matter what, I assure you. Your father definitely didn\'t love Slytherins in his younger years, but he grew out of such foolish notions in time. Your mother was once great friends with a Slytherin.\'

That did it.

\'Slytherin?\' the hat asked through a chuckle. \'My, my, you really do want to shake up the masses, don\'t you? Hmm... Slytherin, quite the risk. Much could happen, but... hm... yes, You could be great, it\'s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that. Yes, quite a risky choice, but with great risk comes great rewards. Tread carefully, Harry Potter, and I wish you the best of luck in \"SLYTHERIN!\"

**Author\'s Endnote:**

**The games have begun and I think it is already apparent how a canon-ish Harry who is naive, vulnerable, and desperate for friendship reacts to the introduction of a new group of friends. I honestly believe this is pretty much how it would have gone if Harry had accepted Draco\'s offer. He really did just latch onto the first people who showed him kindness. In this story, that just so happened to be the Malfoys.**

**Also, yes, I am using heirs, lords, and have a political system. I assure you that Harry won\'t be dipping his toes into politics beyond *maybe*** **some very basic in-house stuff for many years. No eleven-year-old political masterminds here. That will be left to the adults.**

***The Great Hall at Hogwarts***

***9:43 PM***

A heavy and impenetrable silence more total and absolute than most present had ever experienced fell over the Great Hall as soon as the hat had uttered its final syllable. The dumbstruck expressions that marred most faces dotted throughout the room might have led one to believe that an otherworldly deity had appeared in the hall\'s centre and suddenly revealed the deepest, darkest secrets of the universe. Secrets the likes of which mere humans could simply never comprehend.

Harry felt every decibel, or lack thereof, as he stood and made his way towards the Slytherin table, trying to look as though the reaction of the hall hadn\'t fazed him. Each of his footsteps echoed ominously against the ancient stone floor no matter how lightly he trod. Harry fancied that he could hear his own breath and heartbeat as he drew ever nearer to the table bedecked in green and silver.

Just as he was sure he would reach the Slytherin table before a peep escaped from the masses --- who seemed to somehow be imprisoning all sound in the world --- a single, steady set of hands began to clap. Harry realized that the set of weathered hands belonged to the same twinkly-eyed man he had seen on the back of that chocolate frog card on the way to Hogwarts.

It was Albus Dumbledore.

Very slowly and with the hesitation one might expect of a particularly frightened skydiver, the hall began to clap. Harry could not help but notice how muted the applause seemed. Not only compared to the likes of that which had come before it, but even to the tumultuous muttering that had followed him up to the spindle-legged stool.

\"Rivers, Oliver!\" called Professor McGonagall, obviously and successfully attempting to draw the majority of the hall\'s attention away from Harry, who was beginning to noticeably fidget as he took his seat at the end of the Slytherin table.

All of the first years were at the far left end of the table, as it was the only spot that seemed to have been left for them and none of the older students seemed to be moving.

The seating order was obviously alphabetical, with Bulstrode and Crabbe at the very end sitting across from one another and the others following to their right in ascending alphabetical order. Harry sat directly across from Pansy Parkinson and beside Theodore Nott, who sat across from a small, timid-looking blonde girl named Lillian Moon.

\"RAVENCLAW!\" shouted the hat, pulling Harry forcefully from his observations and thrusting his psyche roughly back into reality with a resounding jolt.

\"Well done, Harry!\" congratulated Pansy, beaming at him as though he had just been awarded the Order of Merlin, First Class.

Harry barely had the energy to respond, choosing instead to simply nod along, allowing the ever-building exhaustion brought on by the night\'s events to seep out of him, yet still somehow managing to look somewhat composed.

Draco looked extremely smug. \"As if there was ever any doubt,\" he drawled. \"I did tell both of you he would be in Slytherin, didn\'t I?\"

\"You did,\" admitted Theodore, \"but the Potters have been Gryffindors for centuries. We just had to make sure the apple wouldn\'t fall right under the same tree.\"

\"Such a lack of faith. You should put some trust in me, Nott. Things might run smoother that way.\"

Theodore scowled and shook his head just as the final boy to be sorted --- Blaise Zabini, a tall, dark-skinned boy with sharp, slanted features --- joined them at the Slytherin table. Before the conversation could continue, the man from the chocolate frog card had taken to his feet; his arms were outstretched as though to embrace the lot of them, who had all fallen silent as soon as he\'d made his stand.

\"Welcome,\" he said. \"Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!\"

The man retook his seat, but Harry was hardly focused on that. His attention was effectively captured by the hundreds of plates of food that had appeared on all tables. Heaps of pasta, piles of potatoes, stacks of roast beef, and mounds of pork chops, chicken, and steak, as well as vast numbers of other things that Harry didn\'t know. Many of them he was sure he would never have known, even if the Dursleys hadn\'t been intent on ensuring he ate the bare minimum of a select few choices.

They were, after all, perfectly normal, thank you very much. Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of Number 4 Privet Drive would never have been caught dead eating anything that was even remotely out of the ordinary.

\"Mental,\" muttered Theodore from beside Harry, cutting quite ruthlessly into a piece of beef. \"Old codger is losing it.\"

\"Is he... a bit mad?\" asked Harry.

\"Mad hardly does it justice,\" sneered Draco. \"Father\'s been saying for years anything so great about Dumbledore faded ages ago. He doesn\'t even think he\'s fit to run the school, you know.\"

\"But he beat that dark wizard, didn\'t he?\"

\"Grindelwald, yes,\" Theodore admitted. \"There\'s a lot more to that than was said on the frog card, though. And that was years ago. Dumbledore isn\'t the same man he was when he fought Grindelwald. I doubt he\'s even the same man who fought against the Dark Lord.\"

\"You mean Vol---\"

\"Don\'t say the name,\" Theodore hissed furiously, glancing sharply around the table to ensure nobody had heard him.

It appeared that no one had.

\"Potter, whatever you do, don\'t say that name. There\'s a reason witches and wizards fear speaking it.\"

\"Why do they?\"

Draco and Theodore exchanged veiled looks, but it was Pansy who answered. \"Harry, the Dark Lord was a great wizard. A terrible wizard, but a great one. He did things with magic that most people didn\'t think were possible. Some of the things he did... well, Theodore is right. There is a reason people fear his name. No one ever managed to stand against him. He took on the entire ministry *and* Dumbledore. He might have even won had it not been for you. Even after he attacked you, plenty of people don\'t think he\'s actually dead.\" She glanced nervously around the table to make sure nobody was listening in on them. \"Plenty of people believe he\'ll come back one day.\"

Harry had to resist the urge to shudder. That was ominously similar to what Hagrid had said about Voldemort. How when he wanted somebody dead, they died.

\"*No one ever lived after he decided ter kill \'em, no one except you, an\' he\'d killed some o\' the best witches an\' wizards of the age --- the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts...\"*

Harry remembered yet another thing Hagrid had told him about Voldemort. Another thing that tied into Pansy\'s monologue, and a thing that actually made him shiver.

\"*Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he\'s still out there, bidin\' his time, like, but I don\' believe it. People who were on his side came back ter ours. Some of \'em came outta kinda trances. Don\' reckon they could\'ve done if he was comin\' back.*

*\"Most of us reckon he\'s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on.\"*

The two sentiments were eerily similar, just with one, glaring difference.

Hagrid had been sure Voldemort was powerless and for all intents and purposes --- finished.

Pansy, Draco, and Theodore seemed much less sure of that fact, and it caused the hairs on the back of Harry\'s neck to stand on end.

Or perhaps that was the intense stare he could feel, practically burning a hole in the back of his skull.

He glanced up to the staff table and quickly located the source of the stare. It was coming from a man who was speaking with Professor Quirrell --- still adorned in the same ridiculous-looking turban he had worn in the Leaky Cauldron. This other man wore far more standard-looking black robes. He was thin and sallow-skinned, with long, greasy hair as black as night and deep, intense eyes as dark as endless tunnels. Where Hagrid\'s black eyes seemed to emanate warmth, this man\'s radiated the opposite and drew all warmth into them, as if they were gaping chasms or vast, black holes.

The man turned away from Quirrell for but a second to meet Harry\'s own eyes, and a white-hot stab of pain shot across his scar like the very bolt of lightning it was shaped after.

\"Ouch!\"

\"What is it?\" asked Draco.

\"N-nothing.\"

The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher\'s look --- a feeling that he didn\'t like Harry at all.

\"Who\'s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\"

If any of his new friends were surprised he knew Quirrell, they didn\'t say it. \"That\'s Professor Snape,\" said Draco. \"He\'s our Head of House and Hogwarts\' Potions Master.\" The boy smirked maliciously. \"He\'s supposed to be terribly biased towards us. I can\'t wait to see how our first Potions lesson goes.\"

Harry nodded along slowly, much less enthusiastic to spend time with this man than Draco.

He was sure Snape intensely disliked him, even if Harry had absolutely no idea why that might be. It wasn\'t as if he had done anything to the man.

Harry spent the rest of the meal mostly in silence, ignoring the concerned glances Pansy shot his way every so often. He was content to alternate between watching Snape up at the staff table and listen to the conversations going on around him.

When both dinner and dessert were finished and had vanished from the tables, the venerable Hogwarts Headmaster was on his feet once more, his presence alone commanding complete and absolute silence.

\"Ahem --- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.

\"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\"

Dumbledore\'s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of a set of red-headed twins at the Gryffindor table.

\"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.

\"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.

\"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\"

Many in the hall laughed, but most at the Slytherin table just snorted or shook their heads in disgust at what they obviously viewed as a tasteless joke.

Not Harry.

He didn\'t say it aloud, but he had the oddest, yet most persistent feeling that Professor Dumbledore was being serious.

Deathly serious.

***September 2, 1991***

***The Potions Classroom***

***9:00 AM***

Harry had risen bright and early the day after they had arrived at Hogwarts. He was used to rising early, for it had been expected of him to make the Dursleys breakfast most days.

The Slytherins had all made their way down into the depths of the Hogwarts dungeons after the feast on that first night and been led through an entrance concealed behind a brick wall that slid aside like a muggle sliding door when the correct password was spoken.

Their common room was dark with a low ceiling, and the walls appeared to be hewn straight from ancient stone. Except for the centrally-located fire blazing merrily at what seemed to be all times of the day and night, the lone lights in the common room were bright green orbs that seemed to cast a pale, ghostly light over the room. It added to the haunting feel brought on by the dark view they had out into the lake outside, as well as the long, deep shadows that the lights sent flickering across the walls.

On either side of the common room, dark tunnels lit by torches led off to the dorms and bathrooms. Each year had its own dorm section, and within each section were a number of rooms which each housed two students.

Draco had offered to bunk with Harry, who had readily accepted. That left Theodore Nott with the Zabini boy, and Crabbe with Goyle on the boys\' side. Daphne Greengrass bunked with Tracey Davis, while Pansy had practically demanded her own room, seeing as there was an odd number of females. Bulstrode and Moon hadn\'t objected, choosing to bunk together and leave Pansy the privacy she had so clearly desired.

Harry had taken the bed nearest the door, leaving Draco to the one nearest the small porthole that looked out into the lake. He had been asleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow; though he\'d had the oddest dream of Professor Snape, a talking turban, and a flash of green light; though he hadn\'t remembered it when he had awoken that next morning.

Draco had still been fast asleep, as had the others, so Harry had decided to go out and explore the castle.

He hadn\'t really found much aside from the Potions classroom and Professor Snape\'s office, but it was a start.

The former actually came in quite useful.

After breakfast with his friends, who had been mildly worried about where he\'d run off to, they were all given timetables. Their first class would be Potions with the Gryffindors, so Harry had led the way down into the dungeons and to the classroom he had found earlier that day. He sat with Draco, while Theodore sat with Pansy one row in front of them.

Draco had wanted to sit in the front row, but Harry had insistently refused to sit anywhere but in the back. The idea of people behind him was something he was not at all comfortable with. This had made no sense to Draco, but he had eventually accepted. It wasn\'t as if it made a world of difference to him.

Most of the first-year Slytherin contingent was present in the classroom before the first Gryffindor not named Hermione Granger arrived, though none dared to be late. The tall, red-headed boy who had been going on about a troll and his sandy-haired companion had cut it close, but they had just made it.

The door slammed open not ten seconds after they had taken their seats, and Professor Snape strode into the room with his robes billowing as if caught in a non-existent wind.

It was quite the image.

He started class by taking the attendance and his dark eyes paused when they reached Harry\'s name. \"Ah, yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new... celebrity.\"

Nobody dared to make a sound as Harry fruitlessly fought against his fast-rising blush. Snape studied all of them with his dark, tunnel-like eyes before his monologue began.

\"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making.\" He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word. Snape had the gift of keeping a class quiet without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\'t expect you will truly understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses\... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death --- if you aren\'t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\"

More silence followed this little speech. Harry sat stock-still, not willing to do so much as move. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she was not, in fact, a dunderhead.

\"Potter!\" said Snape suddenly. \"What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\"

Harry had no idea.

He knew what both ingredients were, but he had never heard of combining them. It was odd. Harry had read most of the first-year section of his textbook, but couldn\'t for the life of him remember any potion that combined the two ingredients. Everyone else in the room looked stumped, too; sans Daphne Greengrass, who looked strangely surprised. Even Granger no longer looked so eager, seeming much more put out and a whole lot more apprehensive now than she had a moment earlier.

\"I don\'t know, sir,\" Harry admitted quietly, trying not to redden even more than he already had whilst Snape had taken the attendance.

The professor\'s lips curled into a sneer. \"Tut, tut --- clearly, fame isn\'t everything.\" He was obviously trying quite hard not to smirk. \"Let\'s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\"

Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry knew the answer to this one, small mercy though it was.

\"In the stomach of a goat, Professor.\"

Snape\'s jaw seemed to tighten. \"Indeed you would. You should have no problem then, Potter, in telling me exactly what a bezoar is?\"

\"It\'s a small stone that forms from the goat\'s bodily fluids, sir. It cures most poisons.\"

Hermione Granger hadn\'t even had the chance to raise her hand that time, and she appeared very put out about it.

Snape\'s expression did not change. \"Correct,\" he said silkily. \"And what, Potter, is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?\"

Granger stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling. Harry noticed that Draco, Theodore, and Pansy were all glaring at her for a reason he couldn\'t entirely decipher. He supposed it was a bit rude to assume he wouldn\'t be able to answer, but if looks could kill...

\"There\'s no difference, sir. They\'re the same plant. I think it\'s also called aconite.\"

Snape looked oddly cross and he whirled on Granger. \"Sit down!\" he snapped, and she fell back into her seat with the swiftness of one commanded by a drill sergeant. \"Three points from Gryffindor for your deplorable behaviour, Granger. I would expect any civilized child with an ounce of dignity to remain in their seats while class is proceeding, and to not attempt to steal the praise of their classmates like a pathetic pet begging its owner for scraps.\"

Granger briefly looked as though she might actually cry, and Draco, Theodore, and Pansy were caught up in fits of laughter. Harry didn\'t join in, but he didn\'t laugh very often, anyway.

\"Weasley,\" snapped Snape, \"what exactly is the plant I have just mentioned?\"

\"Uh... aconite, sir?\"

\"Not the name of it, Weasley. What is it? What are its properties?\"

The boy flushed as red as his hair as many of the Slytherins laughed. Harry could not help but grin, though he hid it behind his hand.

\"I dunno, sir.\"

\"Speak up, Weasley. I couldn\'t hear you.\"

\"I don\'t know, sir.\"

\"Shame. For your information, aconite, otherwise known as monkshood and wolfsbane, is a leafy and poisonous variety of plant that is particularly dangerous and quite difficult to detect. Powdered root of asphodel when added to an infusion of wormwood creates a sleeping potion so powerful it is aptly named the Draught of the Living Death. The other questions were answered by Potter, and I will not repeat him. Well?\" Snape barked. \"Why aren\'t any of you writing this down?\"

Harry couldn\'t help but notice, ten minutes later, when Draco and Pansy were each rewarded with five points to Slytherin for answering questions far simpler than his own.

He hadn\'t been awarded so much as a point, and he was quite sure the Draught of Living Death was not a first-year potion.

***Later that afternoon, in the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom...***

After Potions, the Slytherins had attended Charms, which was taught by a diminutive man named Professor Flitwick. He was so short, he needed to stand on a stack of books just to see over his desk.

That class was nowhere near as eventful as Potions.

Professor Flitwick had fallen off his stack of books when reading Harry\'s name aloud and he had made some objects fly around the room at high speeds. Outside of that, he had covered the year\'s curriculum and mostly spent time going over safety precautions.

After Charms, they had lunch and then one of the classes Harry was most looking forward to.

Defence Against the Dark Arts.

It was by far the strangest classroom he had seen up to this point, though he supposed a man who marched around in a purple turban with no apparent justification would inevitably have his eccentricities.

It was a stiflingly hot room, with the windows veiled and the walls lit by floating spheres of magical light --- similar in colour to the ones that hung in the Slytherin common room. Everything seemed to smell vaguely of garlic despite the presence of a vast number of burning incenses. Pansy told them that Quirrell was apparently afraid of a vampire he\'d fought off while on his travels the previous year.

When they had all taken their seats, Professor Quirrell began to speak and Harry found himself taken aback.

The horrible stutter the man had been plagued with back in Diagon Alley was gone as though it had never existed, and his low, smooth tones were spoken with what sounded to Harry like a shocking amount of confidence.

It was such a drastic shift that it left his head spinning.

Or perhaps that was the smell of garlic or the odd pain that seemed to be emanating from the scar on his forehead, of all things; it was impossible to tell.

\"Welcome to your first lesson in Defence Against the Dark Arts. The single most important class you will attend while at this school, since it is the only class that can prepare you for any and all situations you might one day find yourselves trapped in.\"

Professor Flitwick had also made valid arguments about the validity of his own subject by preaching its versatility. He had said it had roots in all sorts of things from duelling to household upkeep, and everything in between.

But to Harry, Quirrell\'s point was far more compelling.

He knew all too well what it was like to feel helpless in situations one would rather not be in, and that opening line drew his complete and undivided attention.

\"In order to defend yourself against something, you must first understand what exactly it is that is attacking you in the first place. In this instance, you must know what the Dark Arts truly are. According to the Ministry of Magic, the Dark Arts are any number of magics that they deem to be illegal.\" Harry couldn\'t help but notice the obvious distaste Quirrell used to state that fact. \"According to the more educated among us, the Dark Arts are powerful magic that is used with the intent to harm, maim, or even kill. The ministry\'s classification is categorically flawed since I could cause great harm --- and even potential death --- with a wide number of spells that they are perfectly happy for each and every one of you to learn while at this school.\"

That... was a shockingly valid point, actually.

\"The Dark Arts are a monstrous branch of magic. A branch of magic that is so vast and ever-evolving that it is likely you will often be completely unaware of what exactly you are fighting. The best way to defend yourself against the Dark Arts is by having as many different ways of defending yourself as possible. The more complex and multi-layered your defence, the better chance you stand at defending yourself against magics that are quintessentially complex and intrinsically multi-layered themselves. In what I would like to think is my own, well-educated opinion, I think a spell often isn\'t made by how much damage it can cause, or how well it defends against a potentially damaging spell. I think it is, or, more aptly, should be measured by how many ways it can cause damage, or how many ways it can protect you.

\"But when speaking about things so naturally complex, I\'m afraid we must slow down. Complex structures don\'t appear overnight. If they did, they would crack, crumble, and never be seen again. They are built on sound foundations, and that is the only way they will continue to stand at all. This is no different. This year, I will be helping you to build foundations as solid as I can so that, as you continue your education, you can continue to expand upon them and one day hopefully have defences as flexible as the arts that would seek to undo them.

\"Now, I will be teaching you a very basic spell for today\'s purpose. You will all have no trouble with it. It isn\'t the most useful of spells, but today, we will be working on hitting your target and, if you just so happen to be the target, not getting hit. Now, pair up and we shall begin.\"

And so they did.

They were taught the Stinging Hex, which gave Harry no trouble at all. He even managed to cast it on his first try. Theodore and Zabini had as well, and Draco and Davis had got the spell to work on their second. What was marginally more difficult were the drills Quirrell put them all through, but Harry did well.

He had spent enough time dodging in his life to have the basic principles down. Watch the chest of your opponent to see which way they might move, and then react. His aim was accurate and he managed to hit more targets than anyone else, except for maybe Zabini, though Theodore wasn\'t terribly far behind him.

By the time the class had ended, Harry was exceedingly eager to learn more.

So eager, in fact, that he planned to rush off to the library at his earliest convenience.

***September 3, 1991***

***Greenhouse I***

***9:00 AM***

Much of the ostensibly impenetrable layer of clouds that had veiled the earth two days before had cleared by the time Harry and his classmates made their way down to the greenhouses on their second morning at Hogwarts, eagerly awaiting their first-ever lesson in Herbology. Harry and Draco walked down the sloping lawns with Pansy and Theodore off to either side, and Crabbe and Goyle flanking the procession a step or two behind. They oddly looked as though they were bodyguards for some sort of illustrious group of high-ranking officials.

The first-year contingent from Ravenclaw was waiting for them by the time they reached the greenhouses, as was a short, dumpy woman named Professor Sprout. She had flyaway hair that was beginning to grey and a kind-looking face. She led them all into the greenhouse before telling them to group up in fours at each table. Harry, Draco, Pansy, and Theodore took one together, and the class began in earnest.

\"Welcome to your first lesson in Herbology, everyone. I am Professor Sprout and I will be your instructor for at least the next five years, depending on your grades and decisions after you sit your O.W.L exams at the end of your fifth year. I am the Head of Hufflepuff House, but my door is always open to any who would like to ask me anything at any time. You are all always welcome.

\"Now, Herbology. I see that many of you seem to already have preconceived notions about my class. Many students walk into these greenhouses and wonder what could possibly be so important about leafy plants and colourful flowers. Some of them even think this class is a joke, or they take it lightly. Outside of its obvious applications in Potions --- a subject with a much more well-established reputation --- Herbology is among the most taxing and potentially even dangerous magic you will perform while at this school.\"

Several students snickered. Pansy was among them, though she hid it well behind her hand.

Instead of looking upset, Professor Sprout simply looked indulgently amused. \"Yes, the exact reaction I expected. Those who want to enroll in the Auror corps must take this class through their seventh year, you know?\" When the reaction didn\'t change, she sighed. \"Very well. Who can tell me the name of a plant that might kill a witch or wizard if they get too close?\"

That shut them all up at once. Harry could hear no snickering now.

\"Miss Greengrass?\" indicated the professor.

\"Devil\'s Snare, ma\'am.\"

\"Correct, take three points to Slytherin. Can anyone tell me what Devil\'s Snare is?\" She pointed out a small, Asian girl from Ravenclaw. \"Yes, Miss Li?\"

\"It\'s a plant that will strangle anyone or anything that touches it, Professor.\"

\"Indeed it is, Miss Li. Take three points for Ravenclaw. Can anyone tell me how to defend against it?\"

Greengrass raised her hand at once, but Sprout waited to see if anybody else could answer. After a great deal of hesitation, Theodore raised his own hand. \"Fire?\" he answered without much confidence.

\"Not a complete answer, but that would work, yes. Take two more points to Slytherin. Miss Greengrass, would you care to explain the full answer?\"

\"Devil\'s Snare can only survive in damp, dark climates. Light will drive it away and fire will actually kill it.\"

\"Correct, another three points. Yes, I hoped that would prove to you that Herbology is no laughing matter. If you are not all very careful when dealing with some of the plants we will be handling much later in your education, disaster could strike. I need your undivided attention at all times in this class, and you must do as I instruct. Am I understood?\"

They all nodded and the lesson went on.

Herbology was followed by History of Magic, which utterly failed to live up to any expectations Harry had for the class.

He had been, and still was, very interested in the subject and he had actually spent a considerable amount of his summer reading the textbook associated with History.

Yet the class proved to be a complete and utter waste of time, in Harry\'s opinion.

Professor Binns had been very old when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up the next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him.

Ever since that fateful day --- and likely long before --- Binns doomed all of his students to a guaranteed five years of completely consistent monotony. He had the most monotone voice one could possibly imagine, and he spent the entirety of Harry\'s first class of History of Magic reading from a comically long roll of parchment that stretched down to the floor and unravelled several feet in front of him. He never looked up, not once, and he failed to notice when half of the class either began whispering to each other, started sleeping, or began to play games like wizard\'s chess. Nothing changed until the end of the class, at which point he promptly rolled up his parchment and floated straight through the wall and out of the classroom without so much as a backwards glance.

Harry was beyond disappointed and he hoped his next class would not disappoint him in the same way this one had.

After lunch, the first-year Slytherins got to experience yet another class Harry was greatly looking forward to. Aside from Defence Against the Dark Arts, it was probably the one he was most excited for --- Transfiguration.

Professor McGonagall was waiting for all of them when they entered the room; her countenance as strict-looking as it had been at the welcoming feast, if not even more so. She waited, rhythmically tapping her foot against the floor until the bell rang to signify the start of her class. With a lazy flick of her wand, the door softly closed, and the lesson began.

\"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\" she said. \"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\" With another wave of her wand, she transformed her desk into a pig before effortlessly reverting it back again. \"Can any of you tell me which branches of Transfiguration I just used?\"

Several of them raised their hands, and Harry took no small amount of pleasure in being the first whose hand hit the air. He had spent quite some time studying this subject, after all.

\"Master Potter?\"

\"Transformation and untransfiguration, Professor.\"

\"Correct; three points to Slytherin. Can you tell me which branch was associated with which action?\"

\"Transformation with turning the desk into a pig, untransfiguration for turning it back.\"

\"Correct, take another two points. Yes, as I have hinted, there are branches involved in the overarching form of magic that is Transfiguration. Transformation, untransfiguration, vanishment, and conjuration.

\"Transformation is the branch of magic concerned with turning one thing into another. Just like, as Master Potter has said, turning my desk into a pig. Untransfiguration is concerned with not only reversing transfigurations, but also in recognizing that they have been applied in the first place. This is more difficult and will not be spoken upon until later years.

\"Speaking of which, conjuration is the magic concerned with making something exist that was not there before.\" McGonagall waved her wand, sending a flock of brightly coloured birds soaring around the room. \"Vanishment,\" she continued sharply, \"is the magic that allows you to make objects disappear.\" She swished her wand, and the vibrant colours were gone as quickly as the birds, leaving not even a feather to signify they had once existed at all.

\"In your initial years at Hogwarts, you will almost exclusively be working with transformation and, in rare instances, untransfiguration. Conjuration and vanishment are focused on in your N.E.W.T years, assuming that you score highly enough in your O.W.L examinations to be permitted to continue in this class. Yes, Miss Davis?\"

Tracey Davis had raised her hand into the air, and McGonagall had finished her monologue before pointing promptly to the girl in question. \"Professor, I read something about sub-branches. Can you explain a little bit about those?\"

\"Briefly, yes. They will also be touched on much later. A sub-branch is a branch of a branch, for lack of a better phrase. For example, transformation is a branch of Transfiguration. Human to animal transfiguration would be a branch of transformation, making it a sub-branch of Transfiguration. There are deeper concepts, as well, but they will not be covered until your later years. They are called nano-branches and femto-branches. An example of this would be, say, mammal to reptile transformations. Does that answer your question, Miss Davis?\"

\"Yes, Professor. Thank you.\"

McGonagall nodded curtly before proceeding to begin a long lecture on standard safety procedures, as well as the course curriculum for this and future years. Had it not been for the fact they had a double period, Transfiguration would have been yet another class in which they performed no magic at all.

Mercifully, it *was* a double period, which meant a practical lesson.

\"Keeping all of that in mind,\" Professor McGonagall was saying, \"I believe it is time for you to begin your practical education in my class.\"

She gave her wand another wave. A drawer on her desk slid open and a box floated out of it and landed atop the well-varnished surface before opening.

\"Your task,\" she continued, \"is to transfigure one of these matchsticks into a needle. Do not be discouraged if it isn\'t something you manage. I do not expect any of you to achieve it this period. The instructions are on page eleven of your textbooks. Begin when you are ready.\"

The sound of scraping chairs could be heard as everyone scrambled to their feet. \"I\'ll grab the matchsticks if you find the right page?\"

Draco nodded, reaching for his textbook with a smile. \"Cheers, Harry.\"

A minute or so later, both boys were sitting with their matchsticks poised and their wands at the ready. Harry glanced down at the diagram and description in the textbook, though it was fairly redundant. He really had read a lot about this subject and he remembered everything the diagram showed by heart.

The incantation was Compasatus Verto, and the wand movement was vaguely circular, ending in a sharp jab towards the matchstick.

\"Compasatus Verto,\" Draco drawled, doing mostly as the book instructed.

Nothing happened.

\"Tighter wand movements, Master Malfoy,\" instructed Professor McGonagall, who had been looming nearby. \"The spell will never take at your level unless your wand movements are very precise. They become less and less necessary as you progress in the subject, as is the case for any other.\" She turned her stare on Harry. \"Let\'s see you try, Master Potter.\"

Harry nodded curtly and closed his eyes. He pictured the desired end product, just as the book had described, and let out an exhale of breath just as he drew the perfect wand movement.

\"Compasatus Verto.\"

At first glance, it appeared he\'d had as little success as Draco. When examined more astutely, one would notice that his matchstick had taken on a rather metallic hue.

\"Very impressive,\" the professor congratulated. \"A very strong start and much further than most get on their first attempt. Continue working, gentlemen, and I shall return to you in time.\"

As the lesson drew on, Harry managed to progressively change his matchstick into a needle, though he hadn\'t quite succeeded by the time the end of class drew near. Draco had perhaps made his matchstick a bit pointier, but that was the extent of his success. Theodore had gotten the same, metallic effect Harry had earlier, and Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle had yet to achieve anything at all. As far as Harry could tell, Nott and Davis were the closest ones to him in terms of progress.

Despite his relative success, something just felt... wrong to Harry, as though some unknown impediment was halting his progress.

He went through the motions again but once more, nothing happened. His matchstick was quite pointy and exactly the right colour. He just couldn\'t get the final effects he needed and he had been stuck here for the last ten minutes.

After going through the motions several more times, he felt as though he had identified the problem, though it made absolutely no sense.

He felt like envisioning the final product was... restrictive? It was hard to explain, but he felt as though he could do better.

Closing his eyes and readying his wand just as the class\'s end ticked near, Harry instead imagined the final change taking place. Not that it had taken place, but it physically taking place in a sort of slow-motion in front of his very eyes.

\"Compasatus Verto.\"

Harry knew at once he had succeeded. He could feel the shock emanate from those around him, just as he had been able to masterfully gauge the emotions of muggles for many years whilst at Privet Drive.

When he opened his eyes, he found himself completely unsurprised to find a perfect needle in front of him and he could not help but smile. Not for the praise Professor McGonagall showered him with, nor even the points given to Slytherin House. He smiled because he knew that he had just gotten to the bottom of his troubles and suspected he had just made a major breakthrough. He would confirm with the several matchsticks he borrowed from Professor McGonagall to practice with, but he was quite sure he was right.

***September 5, 1991***

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***7:21 PM***

The first years had performed their first practical charm work of the year that afternoon, though it had been remarkably easy and the furthest thing from impressive. They had all been set to work on both the spell to summon light --- Lumos --- and the spell to change the colour of objects --- Colovaria. Harry had performed both of these without effort, as had Draco, Pansy, and Theodore.

The most exciting thing to happen that day hadn\'t been during Charms.

That had been when Harry and the others entered the Slytherin common room after dinner to find the first major notice of significance hung on the wall. It was drawing quite the commotion and crowds of people were herded around it. Crabbe and Goyle had taken the lead, barreling through anybody who stood in front of them and letting their less bulky friends trail in their wake.

Draco looked oddly smug about the whole thing.

When they neared the notice board, it was finally evident what had drawn everybody\'s attention.

They would be having their first flying lesson of the year in exactly one week. It would take place out on the grounds with the first-year Gryffindors.

The latter part of that statement made Harry\'s heart sink.

The rivalry between Gryffindor and Slytherin was very intense. To make matters worse, most of the Gryffindors seemed to think he had betrayed them in some form or another. They all shot him hateful glances any time he drew near and a few of the older members of the house of lions were so bold as to fire minor jinxes at him when he walked by. Crabbe and Goyle had resorted to flanking Harry instead of Draco any time they neared a group of Gryffindors, which had largely prevented any further incidents.

Harry couldn\'t say he was overly thrilled to be spending more than an hour in their presence while riding a broom for the first time. The prospect of flying excited him greatly, but it also made him exceedingly apprehensive. What if he made an absolute fool of himself in front of the entire first-year contingent from Gryffindor?

\"You\'ll be fine,\" said Draco when Harry had asked exactly that. \"Your father was brilliant on a broom, from what I\'ve heard. He played for Gryffindor, and I think he still holds some of the school\'s chaser records.\"

\"Really?\" asked Harry, amazed.

\"Yes, I\'m sure they\'re probably in the trophy room, somewhere.\"

That was when Harry resolved to find the trophy room during what had become his routine early morning explorations.

It was the best perk of being awake long before all the others --- it granted him time to explore the castle he was beginning to love so very much.

When he eventually graduated in seven years\' time, he was determined to have learned every last secret of Hogwarts castle.

***September 6, 1991***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***7:43 PM***

Harry thought it felt good to be of use to people he actually cared for instead of people who treated him like hell. Especially after Draco\'s parents had even included a heaping mound of sweets for him in the packages they\'d sent their children earlier that morning.

The gesture had touched Harry in a way that was hard to describe.

They\'d had Potions again that morning with the Gryffindors and it had been their first actual brewing session of the year. They had been allowed to brew in pairs, which had been a small mercy. Harry knew the content fairly well, but he quickly found out he didn\'t have a knack for brewing potions like he seemed to have for transfiguring matchsticks. Draco was fortunately good at the subject, so he was pretty sure they had done quite well.

Not nearly as well as Greengrass and Davis, however. The former had marched confidently up to the front of the class and submitted her potion with a third of the allotted time remaining, something that had made Harry gape like a fool.

\"Her whole family are geniuses with potions,\" Pansy had told him after the lesson. \"They own a bunch of businesses and the like, but one of them is a major import/export company that specializes in potions and their ingredients. I think Daphne\'s mother actually brews some of the more difficult ones. She\'s probably been teaching her for years. That\'s also why she\'s so good in Herbology.\" Pansy shrugged. \"That and because she\'s a genius.\"

That night after classes, Theodore proposed the six of them go out and practice their jinxes, hexes, and curses. Pansy had politely declined. She said she would rather spend time getting better acquainted with the other girls in her year --- namely the potions prodigy herself, who was the heiress of a Founding Twelve family that owned what was perhaps the most profitable business in the country.

The five boys had bid her farewell and left the common room. The prospect of actually trying magic outside of class sent Harry\'s heart fluttering with excitement, and he hurriedly led his friends to a dungeon classroom he\'d found several days earlier that appeared to have been out of use for quite some time.

\"Don\'t we need targets?\" asked Goyle, frowning deeply at the rather barren-looking classroom.

\"Care to be one?\" Theodore asked.

\"M-me?\"

\"We\'re not going to be using anything deadly, you dolt,\" Draco said with a roll of his eyes. \"We don\'t know anything that good and even if we did, I\'d be surprised if we could actually do it.\" Theodore looked as though he might take that as a challenge, but Goyle acquiesced with a deep gulp.

Harry frowned. This seemed very wrong to him. It seemed like something Dudley would force him to do, but Goyle had agreed and they really weren\'t going to use anything that could actually hurt the larger boy...

\"Care to start, Theodore?\" asked Draco.

\"Certainly.\" Theodore stepped forward and drew his wand with the deliberation one might expect from a gladiator drawing their sword. \"Dolor.\" The Stinging Hex sailed from the tip of his wand and struck Goyle in the chest. He let out a loud yelp and rubbed at the point of impact. \"Thought I\'d start light,\" said Theodore. \"Care to go around? See if we can all do each spell?\"

None of them had any trouble with the Stinging Hex. Goyle got a very mild reprieve when it was his turn to try the spell, at which point Crabbe took the lone jinx. The large boy grunted but gave no other reaction.

This again made Harry frown, but he didn\'t comment.

Crabbe chose the next spell. He chose another simple one --- the Tickling Charm --- and again, none of them had any trouble. Goyle looked even less comfortable being a target for this one, but it didn\'t fill Harry with nearly as much guilt as the Stinging Hex had.

The Jelly-Legs Jinx, Goyle\'s choice, was next. It took him and Crabbe a couple of tries each to get this one, while Harry, Draco, and Theodore had no troubles.

\"Tarantallegra,\" Draco incanted when it was his turn to choose the spell. Goyle\'s legs began moving in a completely out-of-control manner and he wound up falling flat on the floor, which caused Harry to wince before he stepped forward and countered the spell with Finite Incantatem; which served as the counter spell for most minor jinxes and hexes. Actual curses often required specific counterspells, but he doubted any of them knew of any spells like that.

Crabbe and Goyle struggled much more with this spell, but they did eventually get it.

\"You\'re up, Harry,\" said Draco, stepping back with the air of one about to watch a particularly well-publicized firework show.

It was thankful Harry had read as far into his Defence textbook as he had, for many of the more basic spells had already been used.

\"Locomotor Mortis.\"

Light-blue light shot from Harry\'s wand and slammed hard into Goyle, who immediately found his legs stuck together and toppled forward. He was thankfully able to brace himself with his arms.

Theodore whistled. \"Leg-Locker, huh? Not bad; not bad at all.\"

He too stepped forward and aimed, though he looked greatly annoyed when the spell didn\'t take on his first, nor his second attempt. It sort of worked on his third, though Goyle was able to wrench his legs apart with some difficulty. On the fourth, Theodore did manage the spell perfectly, though it took Draco several more tries than that; neither Crabbe nor Goyle could get it to work at all.

Clearly annoyed by his failing, Theodore stabbed his wand towards Crabbe, who had just agreed to take Goyle\'s place after all this time.

\"Petrificus Totalus!\"

Nothing but a purple spark shot from the end of his wand.

\"What is that spell supposed to do?\" asked Harry. It wasn\'t in their first-year Defence Against the Dark Arts textbook.

\"It\'s the Full-Body-Bind,\" Theodore supplied bitterly. \"It\'s a mid-second-year spell, I think.\"

Draco scoffed. \"You think you\'re going to get a second-year spell to work during your first week of first year?\"

\"I know I am.\"

His words were bold, but try as he might, Theodore couldn\'t seem to get the spell to work, even though he was certain he was doing it right. Neither could Draco, for that matter, and Crabbe and Goyle barely tried. They all finally gave up and Harry wasn\'t even going to bother attempting it, if not for Draco.

\"You got the Leg-Locker faster than any of us,\" he pointed out. \"If anyone\'s going to get the spell to work, it\'s you.\"

Theodore looked more than a little bit annoyed by the fact Draco\'s statement was true, but he obviously didn\'t disagree with it, for he nodded curtly and gestured for Harry to try.

\"It\'s a circular motion, right?\"

\"A quick half circle and then a jab towards your opponent,\" said Theodore.

After drawing the wand movement several times, Harry stepped forward with a resolute expression, the steps required to get to his desired result playing over and over again in his mind like a muggle film in slow motion. The method had worked excellently on the number of matchsticks he had borrowed from Professor McGonagall. He could now perform the transformation on his first try, so long as he focused very intently.

\"Petrificus Totalus.\"

A jet of purple light rocketed from the end of his wand and struck Crabbe full in the face. The boy\'s limbs snapped to his sides with an audible sound and he careened forward.

\"Merlin,\" breathed Draco, looking at his friend as though seeing him for the first time. \"You did that on your first try?\"

Harry was blushing deeply now. \"It\'s not that big of a deal,\" he tried, \"it\'s just a spell.\"

Theodore snorted. \"Potter, that\'s a mid-second-year spell and you did it on your first try after a week of magical training. You didn\'t even know about the magical world until July. Merlin only knows what you could do with practice.\"

Theodore no longer looked upset or jealous.

He suddenly looked... intrigued.

\"Prat,\" muttered Draco, firing off a Tickling Charm towards Harry in a good-natured manner.

\"Oi!\" exclaimed Harry as he dodged the spell. \"Watch yourself,\" he said as he fired one back.

Theodore joined the fray a minute later after freeing Crabbe, who immediately joined in with Goyle.

Before they knew it, they were all chasing each other around the room, hurling Tickling Charms this way and that. Anyone walking past the room could have heard their laughter from a corridor away.

It was easily the most fun Harry had ever had. Probably because it marked the first time he was ever just allowed to do something pure and be an actual child.

It was a remarkably good feeling.

**Author\'s Endnote:**

**Sorry for the long AN, but I feel as though it is necessary to avoid a few points of confusion.**

**I have two very quick notes before I make a slightly longer one on Harry\'s current skill level, since I have a feeling they will come up in the reviews otherwise:**

**1 - Master Potter is not a mistake. In British schools --- particularly ones that are either of high class or rather traditional --- the males are referred to as \"master\" until they are eighteen, or seventeen in the wizarding world. I have decided to have all of the older professors call males \"master,\" and the younger ones \"mister,\" since it is slowly starting to become less prominent.**

**2 - Untransfiguration is also not an error. I am aware that the word is horrid, but it is also canon, as is the case for the four branches of Transfiguration theory. There isn\'t a whole lot I can do about Rowling\'s horrible linguistic tastes. Granted, it is perhaps the single most wizarding thing I have ever heard.**

**Now, a note on Harry\'s skill level in this final scene:**

**Harry in canon was by far the best DADA student in his year. He scored an O on the O.W.L. --- which even Hermione couldn\'t do --- and he achieved extra credit with the Patronus Charm. Help or not, he also did very well in the Triwizard Tournament against competitors three years his senior, and he did quite well in the only fair battles we saw him in during canon.**

**I honestly don\'t think it is too outlandish to call Harry a prodigy in Defence Against the Dark Arts canonically, even if he was remarkably average at a lot of other things. This Harry is slightly more talented and quite a bit more studious as well, so I don\'t think him pulling off second-year spells in his best subject is unrealistic.**

**He will eventually be very powerful in this story, but it will be a realistic progression. I just wanted to make a quick note on his current level.**

**Please read and review.**

***September 12, 1991***

***The Grounds of Hogwarts***

***3:30 PM***

It was one of the nicer mornings since the students had arrived at Hogwarts. The sun was protruding out from under its position of rest behind the clouds, casting a soft light upon the lands below. The grass was still green, the leaves had begun to shift colours, and there was the slightest hint of a chill in the air that implied the coming of fast-approaching autumn temperatures. There was little more than a light, whispering breeze, which was all the better, for the last thing Harry wanted whilst riding a broom for the first time was to fly headlong into gale-force winds.

It mattered not how many times Draco reminded him of his father\'s prodigious skill on a broomstick. Harry was not his father, and the last thing he wanted was to make a fool of himself in front of the entirety of Gryffindor House. Draco had persistently told Harry that everything was going to be just fine and that flying really wasn\'t that hard, but Harry hadn\'t dared let his hopes rise too high.

He was excited to fly, just not as much for doing so in front of a house that had quietly ridiculed him ever since his sorting. The last thing he needed was to give them even more ammunition to work with. They were doing just fine without it, in Harry\'s opinion.

Yet still, he was excited to fly. Even more so after his explorations that past weekend, when he had done just as he had vowed to do and found the trophy room he\'d been seeking since the mention of his father\'s Quidditch accolades.

***Four days earlier\...***

Ever since Draco had made mention of it almost three full days ago, Harry had been unable to rid himself of thoughts of his father\'s quidditch trophies.

Yesterday morning, he had ventured out into the castle upon waking just as he had every day since his arrival. What was different about this occasion was that for the first time, he had a purpose. He was going to find the trophy room, which likely contained the first remnants of either of his parents he would ever see. He wondered if there might even be a picture of them. He didn\'t think it was too much to ask for, though he hardly dared to hope.

His search had been unsuccessful that Saturday, but this morning would be different; he was determined to ensure that.

Just as breakfast was drawing near and Harry began to worry he would be late, he found it.

It was a vast, dimly lit room with no windows. Several torches flickered faintly on the walls, casting long, dark shadows across the room and causing the well-polished trophies, medals, and plaques to sparkle entrancingly.

There were awards of any shape and size one could imagine. Medals no larger than necklaces, shining medallions that looked as though they weighed five pounds each, masterfully crafted, creatively shaped trophies whose surfaces shone at the barest caress of light, and plaques taller and wider than Harry.

He was enthralled by the room, as he had never imagined, let alone seen anything like it. If not for his powerful motivations, he might have forgotten why he had come and simply stared on in wonderment at the countless number of both modern and ancient trinkets gathered before him.

He didn\'t forget what had brought him here, so he shook himself out of his dazed state and walked carefully forward, taking great caution not to knock anything over. He did not doubt that even if anything was slightly jostled or misplaced, the Caretaker --- a cantankerous old man named Argus Filch --- would have him scrubbing this and other rooms until the end of time.

Harry searched for some time before he found anything related to the reason he had come. Funnily enough, the first thing he found was not related to his father at all, but his mother.

It was a shining medallion dated June of 1976. His mother had apparently received it for outstanding performances in her O.W.L exam in Charms. Best Harry could work out, she had performed magic well beyond the scope of the examination and had thus been rewarded. Not long later, he found a nearly identical medal for his father, dated from the same time. The only key difference was that he had received it not for Charms, but for Transfiguration.

Harry wondered how magic worked and was transferred. He knew that some traits were linked to one\'s blood and genetic makeup and wondered whether or not magic fell into this categorization. If it did, it might have been possible that his father\'s affinity for Transfiguration had passed onto him, which would explain what seemed to be an aptitude he held for the subject.

Just before the passing of time necessitated his leave, Harry spotted the first major award either of his parents had received, though not for individual accomplishments

It was dated May of 1977, and it was for winning the Quidditch Cup. Apparently, Gryffindor had captured it that year, and his father was listed as one of the chasers. It was a fact that both validated Draco\'s earlier claim and filled Harry\'s chest with an odd warmth that was difficult for him to explain and impossible for him to understand.

***Back in the present...***

For a very brief time, the memory of his father\'s award and the odd surge of warmth had filled Harry with what he now suspected to be delusional confidence.

Now standing on the sloping front lawns of Hogwarts in front of not just his entire year set from Slytherin, but also their Gryffindor counterparts, Harry suddenly didn\'t feel so confident. Draco had tried to break the tension with a jab at the lions for showing up so late, as well as the horrid state of the Hogwarts brooms, but it hadn\'t quite managed to distract Harry from his own internal fears.

\"Don\'t worry so much,\" said Draco with a wave of his hand, \"you\'ll be fine. Granger and Thomas are muggleborns who have never flown in their lives. Besides, if Longbottom\'s grandmother has an ounce of sense, she won\'t have let him anywhere near a broomstick, either.\"

\"Patil and Brown wouldn\'t touch one if their lives depended on it,\" put in Theodore, nodding curtly in the direction of a pretty girl with olive skin and her friend.

\"I doubt Dunbar or Midgeon have done much flying either, if any at all,\" said Pansy, giving Harry a reassuring smile despite the fact she herself looked to be in a state not much better than his own.

Before Harry could worry any more, a middle-aged woman with greying hair, hawkish features, and beady, yellow eyes strode into their midst, demanding their attention with her authoritative presence alone.

\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\"

Harry peered down at the broomstick nearest to him and realized at once that there was some truth to what Draco had been saying. The broom looked ancient and it was clearly battered. Some of the twigs were sticking out at odd angles, and some were so mangled they resembled porcupine quills more closely than what he thought the broomstick should have looked like. It appeared to him as though it would fall apart at any moment, and he could only assume it was magic alone that was holding the weathered old broom together.

The observation didn\'t do Harry\'s nerves any favours.

\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the front, \"and say \'up!\"\'

\"UP!\" everyone shouted.

To his great surprise and immense relief, Harry\'s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. His friends obviously hadn\'t been kidding when they told him others would struggle.

Hermione Granger\'s broom had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville Longbottom\'s hadn\'t moved at all. Harry might have thought brooms acted like horses, reacting positively to a lack of fear, since there was a quiver in Neville\'s voice that only said too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. This logic quickly fell apart as Harry tried to form it though, for he quickly realized he too was nervous; he just hid it much better than the pale, shaky first-year Gryffindor.

Madam Hooch spent the next number of minutes showing them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end before she strode purposefully up the rows of students, firmly correcting their grips as she went. Most had their grips corrected, but Harry was one of the few who didn\'t, something that surprised him. Ronald Weasley had been one of the only others, along with Dean Thomas and a few of the Slytherins. After Draco had been so confident Thomas and some of the others would struggle, Harry\'s faith in what his friend had said started to slowly slip, as one\'s confidence in previous assurances often does in situations of great stress.

The process was furthered still more when Draco was among those who had his mechanics corrected, despite the number of hours he had spent preaching his experience on a broom to Harry and the rest of their group.

\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch. Harry listened intently, ignoring Draco\'s string of muttered curses from beside him. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle --- three --- two---\"

Screams filled the courtyard as Longbottom shot into the sky like a cork before Hooch could finish her count. She called up to the rapidly rising figure, but it was to no avail. If he heard her over his own vocal protestations, Longbottom clearly had neither the confidence nor the ability to try and heed her words. Harry realized he would fall seconds before it happened, but the audible cracking sound that accompanied his forceful grounding still made him cringe along with all of the others.

Madam Hooch bent over Neville, her face nearly as pale as his own as she examined his prone and shaking form with clinical intensity.

\"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy --- it\'s all right, up you get.\" She turned to the rest of the class. \"None of you are to so much as move an inch while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you\'ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say Quidditch! Come on, dear.\"

A still quietly sobbing Neville Longbottom allowed himself to be led off by their instructor, who still shot suspicious glances over her shoulder every so often until she was no longer able to do so.

No sooner were they out of earshot than Draco burst into laughter. \"Did you see his face, the great lump!\"

Most of the gathered Slytherins joined in, but Harry was not among them. A deep frown marred his features, though he hid it from those present the best he could. He liked Draco and he didn\'t want to upset him, or any of his other friends, but he still found it very difficult to laugh at somebody like Neville. It was too reminiscent of what Dudley had done to him for much of his childhood and something about it seemed wrong.

Yet despite his inclinations against his friends\' actions, he held his tongue.

\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil.

\"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" jeered Pansy. \"Never thought you\'d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\"

That shut Patil up effectively. It was rather well done, though the exact subtleties went over Harry\'s head. He did notice how nobody seemed to openly rage at Pansy for her remarks though, and he had a strong suspicion that wouldn\'t have been the case had it been Draco who\'d interjected.

Speaking of Draco, he had darted forward and snatched something up from the ground. It took Harry a moment to identify exactly what it was he held, but the point was moot, for Draco announced it loud and clear not a second later.

\"Look! It\'s that stupid thing Longbottom\'s gran sent him.\"

The remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up, and Harry\'s gut tightened as conflicting emotions raged within him, just as they had hours earlier in the Great Hall.

***That morning...***

Draco had received another batch of sweets, as had Harry, courtesy of the same package. He was still trying to wrap his head around the Malfoys\' generosity and had not yet managed it, but he was profoundly grateful, nonetheless.

\"Care for a stroll?\" Draco asked Harry, Crabbe, and Goyle.

\"Where to?\" Harry asked as the two larger boys nodded in agreement with his question.

Draco smirked and tilted his head in the direction of the Gryffindor table. Longbottom of all people seemed to be temporarily holding court, showing something off to the small crowd of first years gathered around him.

Harry shrugged, not really caring one way or the other as he followed Draco to his feet and trailed him across the hall, coming to stop behind where Longbottom, Weasley and some of the others were sitting.

The round-faced boy seemed to be holding a small, glass, spherical something that Harry had never seen before. The small amounts of sunlight streaming down from the enchanted ceiling far above caught the glass at eye-catching angles, causing it to glitter in the light, giving off the impression that Longbottom was showcasing some sort of long-lost treasure.

A long-lost treasure that Draco snatched swiftly from the boy\'s grasp, drawing the attention of all gathered at the table as he examined the mysterious object with interest. The glass\... something seemed to be filled with vivid, reddish light, and Harry wondered exactly what it was.

His thoughts suddenly became much less important when Weasley and Finnigan sprang to their feet, going for their wands. Harry drew his own instinctively with lightning-like reflexes, hardly realizing he had drawn it at all. Crabbe and Goyle just cracked their knuckles imposingly, but only Weasley had actually managed to get to his wand before Harry had his own drawn, halting Finnigan from pulling his from its resting place.

The moment seemed to stretch on as Harry started questioning what exactly he had just done and whether or not it was the right thing to do.

Why exactly had Harry defended Draco? Judging by everything he knew, Draco was in the wrong. But he liked Draco, and he didn\'t want to see him cursed or hurt. It was an agonizing dilemma. What was more important --- friendship or morals? Harry had never known friendship before and he had never exactly been lectured on what was right and wrong. His ideas on morality were likely jaded. The only thing he really knew was that bullying was horrid, and this did sort of seem like bullying.

But he liked Draco.

Gah!

Merlin, this was complicated.

\"What\'s going on?\" said a sharp and familiar voice that snapped Harry from his deep, philosophical train of thought. Professor McGonagall now loomed over them, staring intently at both groups with narrowed eyes.

\"Malfoy\'s got my remembrall, Professor,\" Longbottom moaned.

Scowling, Draco quickly dropped the remembrall back on the table. \"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him. Harry shot a conflicted look towards the Gryffindors that might have been considered apologetic before trailing in the wake of his three friends.

\"Anything interesting?\" Theodore was asking when Harry retook his seat beside Draco.

\"Just a remembrall,\" the blond dismissed, returning easily to the plate of food in front of him.

Harry glanced furtively around, wanting to ask a question but not daring to actually do so. Having been conditioned against doing such things for most of his life, he found asking questions to be rather difficult.

\"Is something wrong, Harry?\"

Obviously, he hadn\'t been subtle in his contemplations, and Pansy caught him out almost at once, causing him to sigh deeply. \"What\'s a remembrall?\" he asked, hoping the question didn\'t come across as too ignorant or foolish.

\"Oh yeah,\" said Draco, sending a sympathetic look in Harry\'s direction. \"Sorry, I sometimes forget you don\'t know these things. A remembrall helps you remember things you\'ve forgotten. Longbottom\'s was glowing light red because he had forgotten something.\"

\"It has another purpose, too,\" said Theodore.

Draco rolled his eyes. \"I was getting to that, Nott.\" He turned back to Harry. \"If you\'ve had your memories blocked, or removed, or whatever, a remembrall will let you know. It can even sometimes bring them back, depending on how they were blocked. A lot of old, powerful families have them lying around just in case. They\'re not perfect, but they\'re dead useful a lot of the time.\"

That made a degree of sense, but Harry shuddered at the idea of having his memories taken from him. That did not sound at all pleasant, and the idea of anyone playing with his mind was one that greatly disturbed him.

***Back in the present...***

\"Give it here, Malfoy!\" shouted Ron Weasley, darting forward and brandishing a large fist menacingly at Draco. Crabbe and Goyle tensed, obviously ready to fight back if needed.

Draco\'s lips just curved upwards. \"No, I don\'t think I will. I think maybe I\'ll help Longbottom out. Maybe if I give him a good enough reason, the stupid oaf might even learn to fly.\" Crabbe and Goyle snickered as the frown Harry wore deepened. \"Hmm... where to put it? Maybe... up a tree?\"

\"Give it here!\" Weasley bellowed, marching towards Draco with stiffened shoulders and a resolute expression.

Draco lazily tossed the remembrall towards Harry, who almost missed it in his shock, horror, and conflicting tumult of emotions.

It was on instinct alone that he managed to deftly snatch it from the air, and he had never been so conflicted in his life as when Weasley had whirled, snarled, and charged towards him.

Given the opportunity to think rationally, Harry would never know what he would have done. Fear overrode his natural train of thought as Weasley bore down upon him, and he hastily threw the glass ball back to Draco, not wanting to get pummeled by the much taller red-head who looked as though he would punch a hole through Harry\'s face if he got within arm\'s reach.

The distraction was all Draco had needed.

He caught the ball easily just as he mounted one of the brooms and rose steadily into the air. It didn\'t seem as though he had been joking about his abilities now. His grip might have been wrong, but Draco looked very comfortable in the sky, and he leered down at Weasley with obvious arrogance and no small amount of smugness.

\"Come and get it, Weasley,\" he called down.

\"Don\'t!\" screeched Hermione Granger, wide-eyed. \"You\'ll get in terrible trouble---\"

But Weasley wasn\'t listening.

He had already mounted the broom and was now soaring skywards, shooting towards Draco like a vengeful meteorite. The blond barrel-rolled, causing Weasley to sail harmlessly through the space his head had occupied just a second earlier. As soon as he turned, Weasley rocketed at Draco again, but this time he was ready for an evasive maneuver. Draco tried to dodge to the side, but Weasley thrust out his elbow, which slammed painfully into the bridge of Draco\'s nose, causing him to elicit a loud yelp and for a thick, steady stream of blood to begin trickling from his nostrils like crimson droplets from a tap left on low.

He sneered in hatred, obviously livid as he glared back towards Weasley, hovering some ten feet in front of him. \"Fine!\" he spat. \"You want the stupid ball? Catch!\"

The next thing Harry knew, Draco had hurled the remembrall towards the ground, and he suddenly felt extremely guilty for what was about to happen.

Except it didn\'t.

Weasley dove like a madman, earning collective screams from those gathered far below\...

Screams that turned into exclamations of awe and wonderment as, right before it looked as though he would fatally headbutt the grass, Weasley\'s hand shot out and closed around the remembrall. He just barely managed to pull his broom out of the dive in time to avoid certain disaster. Though, his feet did clip the ground, sending him sprawling and rolling across the grass like a misshapen football.

Harry\'s guilt lessened as he noticed Weasley was largely unhurt.

\"RONALD WEASLEY!\"

And then suddenly returned when he saw Professor McGonagall striding towards them, shaking with what appeared to be rage as she glared towards her student with a gleam in her eyes Harry could only assume to be anger.

Draco looked extremely smug despite his crimson mask, but Harry couldn\'t help but think Weasley could have avoided whatever punishment was about to befall him had he just handed the remembrall over.

Those thoughts dominated his psyche even after the class was told to return to the castle. He was so lost in conflicting thoughts as they walked back up towards the oak front doors that he hardly noticed Pansy fawning over Draco or Theodore cursing Weasley\'s name.

He was too consumed by emotions that were as alien to him as the sweets Draco\'s family had been sending.

***That night, at dinner...***

Harry still hadn\'t gotten over his raging emotions by the time his contingent entered the Great Hall for dinner some hours later. To his dismay, Draco immediately made his way towards the Gryffindor table. Harry wanted to make off towards their own, but everyone was following Draco and he could do little more than accept whatever was about to happen.

\"Enjoying your last meal, Weasley?\" Draco asked when they came within range of the boy and his friends.

The blond\'s eyes looked like angry storm clouds in his current state of mind, but Weasley merely smirked back at him, something that made Draco look a lot less sure of himself.

\"You\'re a lot braver now that you have your friends to back you up,\" snarked Weasley, glaring at all of them in turn.

Harry saw Theodore\'s jaw tighten as the boy visibly twitched, obviously desiring nothing more than to draw his wand and curse Weasley into oblivion. Harry himself had a feeling the Gryffindor boy would have been much less confident had the staff table not been full. He knew they couldn\'t do anything to him without getting in immediate and serious trouble.

Draco clearly knew it too, for he sneered viciously. \"I\'ll take you on any day, Weasley,\" he said, actually sounding completely confident and deadly serious. \"How about tonight, in the trophy room?\"

\"Tonight?\"

\"Yes, Weasley, tonight. How about at midnight? There shouldn\'t be too many teachers around by then, and we should be able to duel and get out of there before any of them find out what we\'re doing.\"

Weasley\'s jaw set. \"Fine, you\'re on.\"

\"Who\'s your second?\" asked Theodore.

Ron hesitated. \"Seamus,\" he said after a moment of thought, \"what about yours?\"

\"Harry,\" Draco said immediately and without so much as a thought.

Harry had to fight the widening of his eyes very hard as not to reveal exactly what he was thinking.

Him?

He didn\'t know the first thing about duelling. Had it not been for random snippets of conversation over the past week and a half he had been privy to, he wouldn\'t have even known duelling was a thing that wizards did. He supposed that during their practice session last Friday night, he *had* been the most successful of their group in the practicing of spells, but still...

Even if he was the best candidate, he wasn\'t sure he wanted to. He still felt horrible about what could have happened to Neville\'s remembrall, and he had nothing against Ron Weasley. He didn\'t approve of how he had elbowed Draco in the nose twenty feet in the air. That could have ended in disaster, but Draco had technically started it.

Fortunately --- or unfortunately, depending on how one viewed the situation --- Harry never had the chance to accept or deny.

\"Fine,\" spat Weasley, now glaring at Harry as if he were Voldemort reincarnated.

Draco looked supremely smug as he led them back towards the Slytherin table.

\"What did you do?\" asked Harry in a low hiss of a whisper. \"I don\'t know anything about duelling! I know some spells, but---\"

\"Calm down, Harry,\" Draco dismissed with a wave of his hand and a roll of his eyes, grinning as the group took their seats at the Slytherin table. \"We\'re not *actually* going to that duel.\"

\"We-we\'re not?\"

\"Of course not.\" Draco sounded as though the fact was the single most obvious thing in the world. \"We would *definitely* get caught. The racket a duel would cause in the trophy room would be awful.\"

\"You\'re going to go to one of the professors?\" asked Pansy, nodding along as she suddenly worked out exactly what Draco was planning.

The boy smirked and nodded. \"Exactly.\"

Harry still felt conflicted. For a split second, he debated warning Weasley about what was to come.

He dismissed the idea almost at once.

It would be foolish to do so and his friends would be upset with him, which was the last thing he wanted. Moreover, Weasley had accepted the duel. He wasn\'t being forced into anything and it was his fault if he decided to break curfew by several hours.

He wasn\'t sure that it was the right thing, but Harry nodded along, deciding at that moment he would do nothing to prevent the events from transpiring.

***Late that night, in Gryffindor Tower...***

Ron Weasley shook with both terror and fury as he unsteadily settled into his four-poster bed, regretfully listening to the sobs of Neville Longbottom in the background.

Everything had gone to hell as soon as he and Seamus had left for the duel with Malfoy and Potter.

They had found Neville locked out of the tower as soon as they had stepped outside, and had then been accosted by the walking tornado that was Hermione Granger. Honestly, that girl threw so much at him sometimes that Ron felt like his brain would short-circuit. Worse still, the Fat Lady had been gone, locking them all outside and leading to Neville and Hermione following them to the trophy room.

When they entered, no Slytherins had been waiting for them, and no Slytherins showed up.

They were instead almost caught by Filch, who had obviously been tipped off by Potter and Malfoy, and was on the hunt for any bold enough to break curfew. They fled at once, running blindly through the halls at speeds that Ron was sure he could never have achieved under normal circumstances until, finally, they came to stand outside a locked door, suddenly cornered and desperate for an escape.

Until Hermione had unlocked the door and revealed the terrifying monster within.

Ron had thought being made the new Gryffindor seeker would have been the craziest thing that happened that day, but that baffling bit of reality didn\'t hold a candle to the three-headed monster that loomed behind the locked door leading to the out-of-bounds, third-floor corridor.

He had wondered, for a brief bit of time, exactly what Dumbledore had been thinking by allowing that thing into the school. He still wasn\'t sure it was a good idea, but after Hermione had pointed out the trapdoor under the monster\'s massive paws, he had a new question in mind.

What the hell was Dumbledore hiding?

**Author\'s Endnote:**

**I know this chapter may have seemed like a canon rehash, but the events did lead to some rather different results. Namely, Ron replacing Harry as the youngest seeker in a century. Primarily though, this chapter was used to show exactly where Harry\'s character is at in this story, as well as to not-so-subtly show that I will not be incessantly bashing Ron as most Slytherin Harry stories do. He will actually be getting a lot of limelight in this fic, so I hope you all enjoy me doing pretty much the opposite of 90% of Slytherin Harry stories.**

**Chapter 6: Differing Dilemmas**

***September 13, 1991***

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***2:13 PM***

The first-year Slytherins only had classes in the morning on Fridays, with the not-so-notable exception that was History of Magic. From what Harry could tell, many of the upper-year Slytherins skipped the class altogether. He couldn\'t blame them; it wasn\'t as though Binns would ever notice. He started every class the same way: by floating straight through the wall, unrolling his comically long parchment of notes, and beginning to read. He had never once taken the roll call; not even on the first day of class.

Harry enjoyed the subject, but its corresponding class was wholly and completely disappointing. Binns was an embarrassment of a professor and it took only a surprisingly light amount of pestering from Draco to convince Harry to skip the class that afternoon.

Harry was presently trying to bluff his way through a game of poker and struggling mightily. Pansy wasn\'t helping him nearly as much as she had been on the train, for she was buried nose-deep in a Charms essay Harry and Theodore had completed in the library the night before. Theodore was probably the most academic person in their group. Harry was, to an extent, an academic, but not to quite the same level. He was more curious about magic than anything else, whereas Theodore was already well-informed and hungry for more. The two of them had vacated the common room together on more than one occasion to seek refuge in the library while the others did whatever struck up their fancy at that particular moment in time.

Harry was very close to defeat in their game, and the issue was only exacerbated by the fact his mind really wasn\'t in it.

Ever since the dramatic flying lesson the day before, his mind had been wrought with the conflict between his morals and his friends. Weasley somehow hadn\'t been caught out the night prior, which either meant he hadn\'t fallen for it, or he had just gotten away. Harry wasn\'t sure which, but it had greatly irritated Draco.

He had been in a less than pleasant mood all day, partially as a result of that fact. Harry was far more conflicted. He felt as though he should be upset, just like Draco, as he was the closest friend he had. But he couldn\'t quite will himself to feel that way, since a not-so-small part of him had also spent most of the past twenty-four hours questioning whether or not what they had done was wrong, even if nothing truly awful had come of it.

This distraction was costing him dearly and before long, the game had ended. Harry needed to think. If he didn\'t, the tumultuous conflict would only continue, distracting him from any pursuit he may wish to dedicate himself to. He did have to get a Potions essay done, or at least started tonight, among other things. Theodore also wanted to practice spells again that evening, which meant Harry\'s mind was going to need to be as clear as possible.

He wasn\'t exactly sure what would happen if it wasn\'t, but their first lesson in Transfiguration had taught him that being in the right state of mind and visualizing things in the correct way for you was essential when casting magic. Harry really didn\'t want to find out what would happen if he cast curses while not being in the proper state of mind. Especially if Crabbe and Goyle were serving as test dummies again --- yet another thing that made him cringe and wonder exactly what he had stumbled his way into.

With a quick apology and a muttered excuse about needing some air, Harry scampered from the common room. The excuse about needing some air actually wasn\'t all that out of the ordinary. A fair few Slytherins did need to retreat to the grounds at least once or twice a day to see some light. According to Theodore, being in constant darkness wasn\'t good for most people\'s mental state. The common room had no true windows, since it was underground. The closest thing it had was the portholes, providing a view of the vast lake beyond.

It didn\'t bother Harry. After spending much of a decade locked in a dank, dark cupboard and left to stare dully up at the underside of a singular set of stairs every passing night, the dungeons felt like a vibrant utopia with blindingly bright sunlight and sparklingly perfect seas stretching far and wide.

He got about halfway down the corridor just outside the common room when he heard swift footsteps echoing behind him, very obviously following in his wake. His hand twitched instinctively towards his wand as he glanced over his shoulder, but he quickly became more confused than worried.

\"Diana?\"

\"Good afternoon, Harry. Mind if I walk with you?\" He shook his head in the affirmative, not entirely sure of why she would want to, but not entirely averse to the idea, either.

They walked in silence until they neared the top of the steps leading them up to the castle\'s ground floor, at which point Harry quickly realized he wasn\'t entirely sure where he wanted to go.

\"I know a nice place if you just need a breather,\" said Diana, wearing a knowing expression as she spoke. \"It\'s a few floors above us, but the walk isn\'t terribly long. There\'s a shortcut that will speed things up.\"

Harry nodded numbly, allowing himself to be led up the marble staircase.

They walked for some time before Diana led him through a tapestry and onto a stunning balcony. The weathered cobblestone landing had iron railings that overlooked the grounds that were far below. From this height, Harry could see everything. From the expansive green lawns, to the lake shimmering and sparkling in the afternoon sunlight, to the seemingly endless forest on the edge of the grounds, stretching further than the eye could see.

It was probably the single most beautiful sight Harry had ever seen. The only other that even compared had been his first sight of Hogwarts while riding across the black lake almost two weeks ago, and wasn\'t that just mind-boggling? It had easily been the fastest two weeks of Harry\'s young life, even if they had also been without a doubt the most complicated.

\"It\'s beautiful, isn\'t it?\" asked Diana, smiling fondly out over the grounds, looking more relaxed than Harry had ever seen her younger brother. Here, atop the tower, she could have been a royal surveying her land with pride and admiration. She certainly resembled that image far more than that of a thirteen-year-old girl having a casual conversation with her younger acquaintance.

\"It is,\" Harry agreed, turning his gaze back to the sight in question.

\"I come here sometimes,\" said Diana, \"usually when I need a breather or something becomes too much.\" Harry still wasn\'t looking at her, but he could practically feel her stare burning into his side. \"It\'s a nice spot to just gather your thoughts and calm your mind.\" He nodded slowly. \"Can you tell me what it is that\'s bothering you?\"

Harry wasn\'t sure how to answer that. It was so foreign. He had never been asked such a question in his life and he found it oddly jarring. For his entire life, he had only ever had himself to rely on. It had always been up to him to work out his own problems and sort out any jumbled emotions he had.

He had seen Dudley venting to Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon before, but he had never done so himself. Not that they would have listened to him even if he had --- he actually had a strong suspicion Aunt Petunia would have hit him over the head with a frying pan --- but he could honestly say the impulse had never once arisen.

He wasn\'t sure how he felt about Diana asking him this question and the confusion on his face obviously showed. His eyes snapped back to her briefly, he could see the look of obvious concern that marred her otherwise picturesque face.

\"The muggles you lived with didn\'t treat you very well, did they?\" Harry tensed at the question, but he could tell at once that exact reaction had given him away. \"I\'m guessing you were never asked these kinds of questions before, were you?\" Numbly, Harry shook his head. \"It can be helpful to talk about it, sometimes. A lot of the time, other people have been through things you haven\'t. They might be able to look at a situation that you can\'t look at in the same way.\"

Harry bit his lip. \"It\'s... not easy to explain and... a bit embarrassing.\"

\"I won\'t go around telling everyone about it. You don\'t have to tell me, but if you think it might be helpful, I\'ll do my best to give advice or help you any way I can.\"

Harry couldn\'t help but appreciate the way the question was asked. Diana was not attempting to force his hand; instead, she was simply offering.

Harry\'s instincts all screamed to decline the offer, but he paused, deciding to actually give it some thought before reacting on gut instinct alone.

She definitely had much more experience in these sorts of things than he did. Part of his issue when deciphering the dilemma was the fact he had never had friends before. Diana always seemed to be surrounded by a clique of students around her own age, so Harry assumed she was fairly popular. Even if he was overestimating her popularity, she certainly had far more friends than he had ever had.

He looked back out over the grounds as he took a deep breath, trying to focus on anything but the girl stood next to him as he finally admitted what had been plaguing his thoughts for the better part of twenty-four hours.

\"I don\'t know what I\'m doing when it comes to friends.\"

Diana\'s expression suddenly shifted to the perfect image of sadness, though Harry, still surveying the grounds and looking anywhere but at the Malfoy Heiress, didn\'t see it.

\"You might have to be more specific,\" she said in a soft, quiet voice.

\"Your brother does things I don\'t understand. Yesterday, he took Longbottom\'s remembrall for no reason. He took it at the table during breakfast, then again when Longbottom broke his wrist during our first flying lesson. He started this huge fight with Weasley and then tried to get him in trouble, even though Weasley didn\'t do anything.\"

Harry was wringing his hands and Diana could distinctly see that he was having trouble articulating exactly what was on his mind.

\"I don\'t know why he did it; it seemed pointless. There wasn\'t any reason for it and it just seemed like bullying. But I like Draco. He\'s treated me really well, just like you and your parents have. Same goes for Pansy, Theodore, Crabbe, and Goyle. They all just let it happen, so I\'m confused. Am I supposed to stop him because I think he\'s doing something wrong, or am I supposed to laugh like all the others? It seemed wrong, but he\'s my friend, so I\'m supposed to support him, right? I don\'t want him to not be friends with me because I stopped him from doing something like that, but I also felt bad for Weasley and Longbottom yesterday.\"

Diana didn\'t answer at once. \"That\'s... a complicated question. The first thing you have to understand is that my family and the Weasleys don\'t get along. We have never gotten along, but especially not in this generation.\"

She paused again, fidgeting uncomfortably. \"My brother... he also isn\'t the most mature person you will ever meet. He\'s well-spoken and has been raised to act the part, but he is eleven and very much acts his age. You\'re a bit different. You don\'t know as much as Draco about a lot of things and your views are different. You see the world differently, but knowing less about some things also means you think more. You think before you do things; Draco doesn\'t always do that. He probably just saw a chance to go after Weasley and decided to take it. Longbottom, too. Our families were never directly rivals until lately, but... well, that\'s even more complicated.\"

\"What do you mean?\"

Diana looked much older than she actually was when she next answered. \"Years ago, my father was accused of something horrible. Something he never actually did. He was proven innocent by the Wizengamot and everything. Longbottom\'s parents... they\'re not dead, but they\'re in no state to be his parents. They were attacked at the end of the last war, and they\'ve been locked up in St. Mungo\'s --- the major wizarding hospital --- ever since. They\'re as good as comatose, so Longbottom has been raised by his grandmother and she\'s basically run their family ever since.

\"Well, the thing is, she\'s never let my father live it down. She\'s also accused him of somehow fooling the courts. She\'s made him out to be this horrible person and tried to slander him at every turn. Draco probably lashed out at her grandson because of that.\"

\"That sounds awful,\" said Harry, finally looking back at Diana, who shrugged.

\"I wish she wouldn\'t do it. The Longbottoms are an old and important family, so some people even believe the rubbish she says about Father. It\'s unfortunate, but it\'s part of politics. Our families have different political views, so it\'s something she does to try and take away from the points Father makes.\"

\"That sounds awful, though.\"

\"It\'s part of politics. It\'s not pleasant, but it\'s not unexpected, either.\"

\"So... I should let Draco do these things?\"

Diana tapped her fingers on the rail. \"You shouldn\'t be too upset with him for it,\" she said. \"He\'s been raised knowing these people\'s families attack Father every chance they get. He\'s well within his rights to be upset, I think.\"

Harry nodded; that was fair. He could hardly blame Draco for being angry about such things and his actions suddenly made a lot more sense.

\"But like I said,\" Diana continued, \"you think things through more than he does, sometimes. If you think he\'s gone too far, you can say something after it happens, at least.\" She hesitated. \"There\'s a... sort of unwritten rule in Slytherin that makes this even more complicated.\"

\"Unwritten rule?\" asked Harry, frowning as he tried to figure out exactly what kind of rule the older girl could be talking about.

\"An unwritten rule, yes.\" She sighed. \"If you haven\'t noticed yet, the rest of the school doesn\'t exactly love Slytherin.\"

He nodded; he had noticed. If he hadn\'t initially, the dirty looks he had been getting from many in the hallways and the occasional Tripping Jinx fired from behind had most certainly alerted him.

\"Well, with Gryffindor and Hufflepuff always set against us --- and Ravenclaw not usually wanting to help --- it would be a bad idea for Slytherins to be arguing all the time. If we gave the other houses ammunition or showed them weakness, things would only get worse.\"

Harry could easily understand that. He knew better than most what happened when you showed weakness around people who despised you. Ten years with the Dursleys had practically earned him a Ph.D. in the subject.

\"Well, we don\'t want that to happen, so the rule is sort of not to argue amongst ourselves in public. When we\'re around the other houses, it\'s best to look like all is well and good, that way they don\'t take advantage of the weakness. So if Draco does something in front of the whole of Gryffindor, calling him out on it right then and there might be a bad idea.\"

Harry practically shuddered at the thought. The Gryffindors already hadn\'t been the kindest bunch to him. He could only imagine what would happen if he gave them any sort of advantage.

\"So if I think Draco\'s gone too far or is just being a bully without need,\" Harry said slowly, \"I should talk to him about it later?\"

Diana nodded with a smile. \"Exactly. He\'s far from perfect. Draco is a lot of things and he\'s not the most subtle boy in the world. He also doesn\'t think sometimes, as I said, and he looks up to Father a lot. Father rants about the Weasleys and Longbottoms all the time, so it\'s rubbed off on Draco. I\'m sure he\'s going to lash out at the other children without thinking. If it\'s just banter, it\'s fine. When he starts stealing family artifacts like remembralls...\"

\"It\'s a bit too far,\" Harry finished.

\"A bit too far,\" Diana agreed.

Harry smiled at her. He felt as though a great weight had been lifted off his shoulders. \"Thanks, Diana. I\'m... not very good with feelings and stuff.\"

Her expression turned sad. \"That\'s not your fault, Harry. Don\'t blame yourself for what happened with the muggles. It\'s them who should be sorry. If you ever need help, I\'m always here. I know you might not like asking for it, but it really isn\'t any bother.\" She smiled. \"Maybe having you be a bit more mature might even whip Draco into shape. Merlin knows he could use it.\"

Harry laughed, and the air around them lightened all at once.

***October 7, 1991***

***The Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom***

***1:10 PM***

Harry could happily say the weeks following his conversation with Diana had passed without incident. There had been an odd period of about a week and a half during which Draco had been surprisingly quiet. He had scarcely looked at the Gryffindors during that time, something Harry had noticed when he actually hadn\'t risen to their challenges. The novelty had worn off in time, but he still hadn\'t instigated any new conflicts with the house of the brave. It was an odd and sudden shift, though one Harry was definitely in favour of.

Time away from complex drama had allowed him and the others to settle into their schedule and Harry could easily say he was enjoying Hogwarts more than he had ever dared hope for.

He enjoyed Transfiguration greatly, and he really liked Charms. History was also intensely interesting --- so long as he wasn\'t sitting in Binns\'s classroom.

Despite his enjoyment for several different classes, his favourite of the lot was quite easily Defence Against the Dark Arts. Partly because the content was interesting, and partly because he, Theodore, and Draco had been practicing jinxes, hexes, and curses for the past number of weeks. It had become a sort of ritual every Friday night. They sometimes did practice on other nights as well, but Friday night practices had become a surety.

Part of it, though, was undoubtedly due to Professor Quirrell.

Quirrell was easily Harry\'s favourite professor, even though he did like most of them. Or at the very least, he admired them for their talents.

Quirrell was different, though.

For one thing, he had let them perform practical magic from right out of the gate, which had earned him major brownie points with Harry, as well as much of the Slytherin population. For another... it was hard to explain. He was just... interesting? The way he spoke about his subject was entrancing. He spoke with such knowledge and passion that one could not help but listen, and he had always been more than capable of answering Harry\'s, or anyone else\'s, questions.

That was another thing. Harry couldn\'t ever remember a time Quirrell had refused to answer a question. The other teachers had all said, at least once, that the content brought up by a question would be covered more in later years, but Quirrell had never denied them information.

Not even the odd headaches Harry felt while in his classroom had dissuaded his liking of the man. At first, he had thought the pains had been emanating from his scar, but he quickly realized that was ridiculous and supposed it must have just been the burning incense and strong stench of garlic.

Quirrell also just so happened to teach them really cool magic.

Like that day, for instance, when he decided it was finally time to learn to properly defend themselves.

\"There are two sides to a fight,\" Quirrell was saying. \"Or an attack, or a duel, or any such conflict. There is the instigator, and there is the defender. It\'s not so black and white as that, of course. The instigator can shield, and the defender can attack. That is what makes conflicts conflicts. They\'re rarely straightforward and rarely over quickly. That\'s why it\'s important that no matter what side you\'re on, you know how to do both.

\"So far, I\'ve done my best to help build up your foundations, but if I started flinging spells at you all right now, you would be helpless --- unless you could somehow dodge every spell I threw at you.\" The skeptical tone of his voice did an excellent job of getting across exactly how unlikely that was. \"Dodging is always the best option,\" Quirrell reminded them. \"It takes less time, doesn\'t occupy your wand, and you don\'t have to draw on any energy from around you. The problem is that it won\'t always be an option. Sometimes, you are stuck between a rock and a hard place and your only option is to defend.

\"The most basic form of defence is a shield. Now, there are *many* different shields out there that you can summon with magic. Today, we\'ll start from the beginning. I\'m going to teach you the most basic of shield charms. It wouldn\'t be of much use in a fight or an upper-level duel, but it will serve you all well at your age and it will be an apt introduction to the subject of defensive magic.\" He paused, surveying them all with those dark eyes of his. \"Can anyone tell me what this charm is?\"

Harry had read his entire Defence Against the Dark Arts book through almost two times now --- as it was his favourite subject --- so he actually did know this one. So, apparently, did Theodore and Daphne Greengrass, as both of their hands rose.

Quirrell pointed to Harry. \"Potter?\"

\"The Aegis Vocar shield, sir.\"

\"Good; five points to Slytherin. Yes, Aegis Vocar is the most basic magical shield. It\'s only meant to hold against jinxes and some very basic hexes, but it does have the unique ability to move with the caster. Some more powerful shields can do that as well, but they are much more advanced and they\'re more difficult to maintain.

\"Your task today,\" he continued, \"is to master the Aegis Vocar shield. I don\'t expect many of you to be capable of casting this spell by the end of class, but I am hopeful. If two of you achieve it, you will group up and practice against harmless jinxes from the other. Now, I will demonstrate the wand movement and we shall get underway.\"

Five or so minutes later, Harry found himself standing in a corner of the room, with Draco, Theodore, Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle not far away. He was slowly drawing the wand movement out in the air while the others tried in vain to get the shield to work. Harry\'s eyes were closed and he was envisioning the perfect shield springing into being in front of him.

\"Are you having troubles, Master Potter?\" Harry nearly jumped out of his skin at the sound of Quirrell\'s voice. \"My apologies,\" he said, \"I didn\'t mean to startle you. I was only wondering if you were having any difficulty with the spell?\"

Harry hastily shook his head. \"No, sir. I haven\'t tried yet. I\'ve just been making sure I\'ve got everything right.\"

Quirrell raised his eyebrows. \"And do you think you\'re ready to attempt the spell?\"

\"I think so, sir.\"

\"Let\'s see it then.\"

Harry whipped his wand in a quick, tight circle in front of his chest. \"Aegis Vocar!\"

The shield was not visible, even when cast at its best, but Harry could feel the magic drawn towards him, feel it rush through his wand, and feel the air ripple in front of him. He beamed and Quirrell\'s brows rose still further.

\"May I?\" he asked, gesturing towards where Harry\'s shield must have been. When Harry gave permission, the professor withdrew his wand and prodded Harry\'s shield five or so times. \"It isn\'t as solid as it could be,\" he said, \"but it is an excellent attempt for one with your level of experience.\" He eyed Harry critically. \"This is your first attempt, Master Potter?\"

\"Yes, sir.\"

The man nodded, eyeing him with an intent stare. \"Continue at this level, Potter, and I think I will have to come up with some new challenges for you. You have exceptional potential within this branch of magic. See that it does not go to waste.\"

The professor stalked off to check on the others and Harry pondered the words deeply.

It was one of the first genuine compliments from an adult he had ever received and he had to admit, it was quite a nice feeling.

***October 19, 1991***

***The Grounds of Hogwarts***

***9:24 AM***

The sound of two children laughing might have been heard early one Saturday morning on the Hogwarts grounds had the wind not ruthlessly taken the noise and ripped it away, carrying it adrift almost as rapidly as the source of the sound was flying.

Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy soared above the grounds, laughing exuberantly as they flew a fast lap around the black lake, the wind sweeping through their hair and the cool, crisp fall air caressing their skin.

It was what would likely be one of the last decent fall mornings. Halloween was fast-approaching --- or, as Harry\'s new group of friends called it --- Samhain. Many of the upper-year students had warned their younger counterparts that in the Scottish Highlands, the death of October often meant the end of any chance at decent weather.

Draco had been insistent they take advantage of the morning, and Harry hadn\'t exactly been hard to convince.

Since their first fiasco of a flying lesson, several more had gone off without a hitch. During each of them, Harry had often come to the same two realizations; he really enjoyed flying, and he was startlingly good at it. Draco had most definitely been right in assuming Harry wouldn\'t have any troubles on a broom. It had come more naturally to him than almost anything else he had ever done, and as soon as Draco had seen this, he had practically dragged Harry out on the grounds to fly.

First years weren\'t allowed to own brooms, but they were, with the permission of Madam Hooch, allowed to borrow some of the school ones. Her permission usually hinged on how much aptitude she saw during their lessons and how comfortable she was in allowing them to fly freely. She had no worries about Harry or Draco, so she had acquiesced without drama and they had made a sort of habit of it. Harry would very much miss the early morning flights once the air around the castle was too frigid to comfortably zip through on a broomstick. It was one of his favourite things in the magical world so far. He loved it more than anything he had ever seen or experienced in the muggle one.

The boys\' laughter only became even more joyful when they swooped around the lake once more, this time to notice their friends gathered under one of the trees, the vibrant, fall-coloured leaves dotted out all around them like a haphazardly discarded blanket.

With a glance at each other, the both of them came in for the landing, touching down smoothly in front of Pansy, Theodore, Crabbe, Goyle, Diana, and a few older students Harry didn\'t recognize.

A girl a couple of inches taller than Diana with golden blonde hair was nearest to her. She had deep blue eyes and angelic features, and Harry didn\'t know her by name, though he had seen her around Draco\'s sister more often than not. With them as well were two boys. They were both large, each with short hair. One of them had rather chiselled features where the other\'s were bulkier and his brown hair was slicked back.

\"I don\'t suppose you\'ve met my friends?\" Diana asked Harry once the two first-year boys had taken seats. Harry shook his head a bit nervously --- meeting new people always gave him a certain amount of anxiety.

Diana seemed to notice, as the small, brief smile she shot his way was as reassuring as one could be. \"Right then. Harry, meet Cassandra Yaxley, Graham Montague, and Cassius Warrington. All heirs or heiresses to their respective families.\"

Cassandra was the first to offer her hand, though she studied him with a rather piercing gaze.

Warrington was next, and his own stare was interesting in a different sort of way. \"How long have you been flying, Potter?\"

Harry rolled his shoulders a bit awkwardly. \"I\'ve only just started.\"

Warrington\'s brows rose. \"Really?\" Harry nodded. \"Keep practicing,\" he told him, \"you have the build for a seeker and could probably end up on the Slytherin team in the next few years.\"

\"Could be next year,\" said Montague. \"Higgs graduates in June.\"

Warrington nodded. \"True.\"

A part of Harry wanted to deny it, but a larger part of him was dominated by an eleven-year-old\'s imagination. He couldn\'t help but envision himself raising the Quidditch Cup high above his head, resplendent in Slytherin team robes and with the silver captain\'s badge proudly gleaming on his chest.

It was a beguiling image.

Beguiling enough that he didn\'t even notice the way Draco frowned very deeply at the words, nor his older sister shooting him a warning glance over Harry\'s shoulder.

***October 30, 1991***

***The Charms Classroom***

***2:56 PM***

At long last, the Slytherins were finally set to perform genuinely interesting practical magic in Charms.

Thus far, they had done little more than read an obscene amount of theory, write an obscene amount about theory, and learned mundane spells that took absolutely no effort to master. For the better part of a week, Flitwick had been promising that they would finally be learning something interesting --- the Levitation Charm. Harry was certain, judging by the levels of excitement exuding from each and every single one of them, that the whole class would have walked out had the diminutive professor changed his mind; but mercifully, the man had kept his word

After an absurd tale about a buffalo ending up on some poor man\'s chest due to a botched incantation, they were all told to come to the front of the class, grab a feather, and begin.

\"Weasley\'s so thick; I bet he\'ll buy the rubbish about the buffalo,\" Draco was saying as they neared the front of the class.

\"All of the Gryffindorks will probably buy it,\" Theodore said with a roll of his eyes.

\"Longbottom might actually wet himself,\" said Pansy with a smirk. \"I hope Professor Flitwick knows more than Charms, because he might have to transfigure his knickers into a nappy.\"

\"Can we not talk about Longbottom\'s underwear?\" moaned Harry, causing his friends all around him to laugh. The conversation switched tones after that, which relieved him, though not for the reasons he\'d led his friends to believe.

Diana\'s point about subtlety had stuck. It was something Harry was slowly working on.

Harry and Draco were at a table together and they were both terribly excited.

Harry didn\'t think he was quite as adept at the theoretical side of their classes as somebody like Hermione Granger, but he was thrilled at the natural talent he seemed to have. Professor McGonagall had described it as an intuitive sense for magic. While Draco didn\'t have that, Charms was one of his best subjects and it was one he enjoyed quite a bit.

\"Wingardium Leviosa,\" he said, swishing and flicking his wand.

Draco\'s feather twitched.

Harry cracked up and Draco scowled at him. \"What\'s so funny?\"

Harry threw up his hands. \"Nothing, nothing. You just sounded so confident.\"

Draco rolled his eyes. \"Let\'s see you go then, Merlin,\" he challenged.

A swish, a flick, and a carefully enunciated incantation later, Harry\'s feather was floating casually above the desk, and Draco was rolling his eyes so hard --- as Professor Flitwick bore down on Harry with a gleeful expression --- that the raven-haired youth was afraid they might fall out.

\"Prat,\" muttered Draco as Flitwick walked away, but the youngest Malfoy was grinning.

Harry smirked too and both boys turned their wands back towards the feathers.

***October 31, 1991***

***The Great Hall***

***6:00 PM***

The Great Hall was more elaborately decorated than Harry had ever seen. There was so much orange present that the entirety of the hall seemed to be bathed in its vibrant, fluorescent light.

The walls were draped in orange and where torches had hung before, there were now pumpkins; their eyes and mouths exuding bright, magical light. Even the usual golden plates and goblets had been replaced by orange. Dumbledore\'s holiday-themed robes were of the same colour and Harry thought they shone just as brightly as the walls, pumpkins, and lights. It was actually rather impressive.

His friends were not at all happy.

\"It\'s an embarrassment,\" hissed Theodore, glaring daggers at Dumbledore from his seat at the Slytherin table. \"The old fool is trying to ruin every tradition we\'ve ever had. He doesn\'t care about any of them. The only thing that matters to him is making the scum feel welcome.\"

\"It\'s disgusting,\" agreed Draco. \"Father goes on and on about Dumbledore and his stance on muggleborns. He says Dumbledore is going to be single-handedly responsible for destroying the old ways if he isn\'t stopped soon.\"

Harry listened to their banter silently, though he found himself very confused for most of the conversation.

The extent of his knowledge about the situation was that pureblood wizards didn\'t celebrate Halloween. Apparently, Halloween was a purely muggle holiday. The purebloods and more traditional halfbloods celebrated something called Samhain. Harry had been reluctant to ask about it. He found asking questions difficult and he didn\'t want to be viewed as foolish. He had considered asking Diana, since she had been so welcoming with questions earlier in the year, but a proper situation really hadn\'t presented itself. Perhaps now would be the appropriate time to ask. It might even stop his friends\' vicious tirade against the Hogwarts Headmaster.

Before he could, the doors to the Great Hall slammed open with a resounding crash that rang through the room like the clattering of many bolts of thunder.

Argus Filch staggered into the room, wide-eyed and clearly terrified. He could barely walk in a straight line, though Harry noticed his typical habit of shuffling was gone. He had never seen the cantankerous man move so fast. In what seemed no more than an instant, he was on his knees in front of Dumbledore, wheezing and gasping as he managed three feeble sentences that were somehow caught by every single student gathered in the luridly decorated hall.

\"Troll... in the dungeons. Did what any sensible man would do and got the hell out of there. Thought you ought to know.\"

Then, he fainted, and pandemonium broke loose.

Several booming fireworks were shot from Dumbledore\'s wand, and the collective mass fell silent.

\"Prefects,\" Dumbledore said in a surprisingly strong and clear voice for one his age. \"If you are members of Gryffindor or Ravenclaw, you will carefully escort your students back to their common rooms. Hufflepuffs and Slytherins, you will all remain here, as I view it unwise to allow you to draw so close to the troll\'s alleged location. I and the other professors will leave after the prefects and their houses, at which point I will be locking you all in the hall. Nobody is to make any attempt at leaving until one of us returns and instructs you all to do so.\" Nobody made a sound. \"Well, prefects --- chop chop!\"

The sound of the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw benches scraping backwards screeched through the hall and the prefects led their charges out the massive doors faster than Harry might have expected. The staff were on their heels, with Dumbledore in the lead, lurid orange robes billowing like autumn leaves in a strong, crisp wind.

Once all of them had left, the doors to the Great Hall closed with a loud, clattering thud.

***Minutes later, on the second floor...***

\"What do you think happened?\" Neville asked Ron in a panic as they slowly followed Percy and the other prefects up towards Gryffindor Tower.

\"No idea,\" said Ron. \"Mum and Dad have always said Hogwarts is the safest place in Britain. They wouldn\'t believe it if I said somebody could have ever gotten hurt at Hogwarts.\" Neville froze in mid-stride, and he suddenly went as white as a ghost. Ron frowned. \"You alright, Neville?\"

\"Hermione\...\"

Ron went ashen.

During that day\'s Charms lesson, Ron had sat at a table with Hermione as they were tasked with mastering the Levitation Charm. She had annoyingly gotten the charm on her first try, but she had also been an arrogant prat about it, in Ron\'s opinion.

Still, he was all of a sudden wishing he had possessed a little bit more tact while they had left the class.

According to Parvati Patil, Hermione was locked up in a bathroom on the second floor, so she would have no idea about the troll running loose in the castle.

\"Oh, bollocks!\"

***Back in the Great Hall...***

\"How could a troll have gotten in?\" Pansy was asking in a hurried whisper.

\"It couldn\'t have,\" said Theodore. \"Father\'s told me about the Hogwarts wards. He says there are none like them in the world. There\'s only one way a troll could have gotten into Hogwarts.\"

\"Are you saying one of the teachers let it in?\" Harry asked with wide eyes.

Theodore\'s eyes gleamed. \"Don\'t be so naive, Harry. Not all teachers are angels.\"

The thought that one of the professors would ever do such a thing made Harry shudder.

All of the conversation dominating the half-full hall seemed to be of a similar nature. The one surety was that everyone had become so preoccupied with their own conversations that nobody had noticed that Filch\'s once prone body had vanished from the hall.

***Meanwhile...***

Ron was well aware that the two of them --- he and Neville --- were likely making the single most foolish decision of their lives as they neared the corridor housing the bathroom Hermione was supposedly locked up in.

Then, the stench hit them. Ron would have cried out in protest had Neville not clamped a hand firmly over his mouth.

Both of them leant slowly and carefully around the corner and what they saw was beyond anything they had ever spotted before.

The grotesque being lumbering through the halls had to be nearly ten feet tall, and it was absolutely massive. Its grey skin gave it a dullishly sinister look, as did its dumb, beady eyes.

Ron and Neville watched in transfixed horror as the thing stupidly walked headlong into a door before growling at it and forcing entry by slamming its fist into the impediment. Seeing a golden opportunity and taking a moment of inspiration, Ron sprinted forward, lunged for the door, slammed it shut, and turned the lock.

\"Ha!\" he exclaimed, and he and Neville beamed openly at each other, taking pride in a job well done.

Until a high-pitched scream ripped through the corridor, and their breath was snatched from them as suddenly as it might have been had they leapt naked into ice-cold water in late January.

\"HERMIONE!\" both boys screamed as they both reached for the handle at the same time.

Ron got there first and forced the door open, then he and Neville charged in, freezing at the sight before them.

Hermione was sitting against the far wall, cowering as the troll loomed above her, towering tall and scowling down at her with obviously murderous intent.

Ron then did the single stupidest thing he had ever done in all his life.

\"Oi, dragon dung!\"

The troll whirled to face him, looking very confused, and then growled and began advancing.

\"Wingardium Leviosa!\" called out Ron, swishing his wand at the row of sinks on the wall to his right.

All but one of them wrenched themselves from the wall with horrible shattering noises, and Neville darted out of the way as Ron thrust his wand towards the troll. One after another, all of the sinks slammed hard against the thing\'s head and shattered.

The troll faltered but didn\'t stop.

Neville was trying to get Hermione on her feet and out of the bathroom, but her legs seemed too shaky to support her weight and Neville was having a hard time hauling her into an upright position. Worse still, the troll was bearing down on Ron, beady eyes narrowed and club raised.

Desperately, he repeated the same spell, ready to die at any moment.

Miraculously, he didn\'t.

The club rose out of the troll\'s grasp and it reached for the weapon confusedly, snorting and grunting as the club flew higher and higher and was soon out of its grasp. It then looked up at the implement now hovering above its head with a dumbstruck expression.

Ron released the spell, and the club fell, smacking into the troll\'s head with a resounding *CRACK!*

The impact drove the troll to its knees and caused the creature to let out an agonized moan as the club split in two as soon as it made contact with the troll\'s head. Ron was so stunned the thing wasn\'t dead or at least unconscious that he hadn\'t noticed its massive, grubby hands reaching for him until it was already too late.

He was pulled forward by the collar of his robes and he was suddenly certain once more he would die.

Until Neville, the meek, outcast of Gryffindor rushed forward with an animalistic war cry and leapt onto the troll\'s back. The beast didn\'t even seem to notice, it was so focused upon Ron. Neville seemed completely unsure what to do, so he withdrew his wand and --- with as much force as he could muster --- drove it straight up the creature\'s nose as far as it went.

The thing howled in pain and threw Ron backwards, writhing as the implement seemed to rub against its very brain. Blood was streaming from its nose like a grotesque waterfall, staining the bathroom floor like a dark wine might a fine piece of clothing. Neville gritted his teeth and, with every bit of force he could muster, pushed a little bit further, trying to channel magic through the mechanism as he did so.

The wand met resistance for but a second before it snapped with a crack that echoed through the bathroom like a broken branch in a noiseless forest. There was an explosion of raw energy so blindingly bright that Ron and the others were left blinking spots from their eyes for several minutes, though they had no trouble hearing the deafening thump of the troll\'s body hitting the floor, nor the way the lone remaining sink precariously shook on the wall.

After they could all see once more, they noticed at once that the troll was indeed slumped, unmoving on the floor and that Neville\'s wand was lying near its head in two pieces.

\"My wand! Dad\'s wand... Gran\'s gonna kill me!\"

\"Is... is it dead?\" Hermione asked at the same time.

Before Ron could even try to answer, the bathroom\'s entrance slammed open and professors Dumbledore, Quirrell, Flitwick, McGonagall, and Snape burst through the door, wands outstretched.

Ron could only wonder exactly how in the name of Merlin they were going to talk their way out of this one.

**Author\'s Endnote:**

**I know it sort of seems that Ron is just canon Harry right now, but I have a lot of character growth planned. He resembles first-year Harry in canon at the moment because, frankly, Harry was the definition of a cookie-cutter Gryffindor, and Ron is sort of that for now. If anything, it should show you that I have no plans of needlessly bashing Ron, and I hope you enjoy his arc in the story.**

***The Headmaster\'s Office***

***9:00 PM***

The headmaster\'s office at Hogwarts was situated in one of the highest towers. It was a circular, ornate room; one that was dotted with the marks of its owner\'s eccentricities.

The current master of this office was a very complicated man. Thus, the room was dotted with a large number of odd-looking instruments; many of them being just as complex and eccentric as the man who owned and, in some cases, had created them.

The man himself was sitting behind the large polished desk, whose surface he was drumming his fingers on. The drumming seemed to be to a rhythm only the old man himself could hear. On a perch not far from the desk, an immaculate bird was sleeping.

Over the perch sat an ornate clock that made perfect sense to the wizened old warlock behind the desk. To most people, the clock would mean nothing. Which was rather ironic, because it was much less complicated than it looked.

Around its exterior, brilliant stars were situated in positions not unlike the numbers on a typical grandfather clock. In its centre, planets slowly orbited an illustrated sun. Most of them simply stayed in their orbit all the time, but two of them broke the designation to float out of line, much closer to the stars dotted around the clock\'s perimeter.

The clock glowed softly as Saturn shifted to align with a star that was, to muggles, in place of where one might expect the number nine to rest. In unison, Pluto aligned with the topmost star.

Almost as if the whole thing had been choreographed, there came a knock from the room\'s door before the clock\'s glow had faded.

\"Enter,\" called the man behind the desk, gently sliding a stack of parchments into one of the drawers nearest him.

The door opened and in stepped a sallow-skinned man with dark eyes and long, black hair. Without prompting, he stepped forward and took his seat across from the venerable headmaster, who straightened up once his parchments had been restored to their proper resting place.

\"Ah, Severus. You are as punctual as ever. I thank you for your promptness in agreeing to such an impromptu meeting.\"

\"Frankly, Headmaster, I would have been concerned had you not called a meeting after tonight\'s... events.\"

\"Yes, it has been quite the evening, hasn\'t it?\" When Snape\'s expression did not so much as shift, Dumbledore frowned slightly. \"I see you are not in the mood for small talk, so I will deliberate no longer.\"

\"Quirrell is after the stone,\" Snape said in a flat tone of voice.

\"Hmm,\" mused Dumbledore. \"An interesting hypothesis. What do you have to support such a claim?\"

\"He is not the man he was when he once taught at this school. I remember Quirrell as a young, naive fool who was filled with all the delusions of a perfect, harmonious world. If what I have heard about his lessons are at all true, his views have shifted.\" His lip curled. \"As has his degree of competency. Yet only when teaching my Slytherins, it would seem. According to three-fourths of the school, he is a bumbling buffoon without a hope of getting through a lecture.\"

\"What of tonight\'s events then? I will remind you that Quirinus was present with myself and the others throughout the whole ordeal.\"

\"He used Filch. The Imperius Curse, I suspect, though we of course can\'t prove it.\"

\"And what do you think his intention was?\"

\"The stone,\" Snape reiterated. \"I don\'t know if you noticed, but Filch was gone from the hall before you even left it.\"

\"I did notice that, yes. It was quite curious, wasn\'t it?\"

Snape pointedly ignored the question. \"As I told you when exiting the hall, I took the time to check up on the third-floor corridor. Imagine my surprise when I saw Filch attempting to open the door.\"

Dumbledore\'s eyebrow rose. \"Open the door? He would have needed the ability to channel magic to do such a thing.\"

\"Or an enchanted knife which can unlock any door that is not hidden behind the most potent of wards.\" Snape levelled Dumbledore with an intense glare. \"Which, as it so happens, is apparently not the case for this door. For what ungodly reason, I do not know.\"

\"So you think Quirinus meant to have Argus retrieve the Philosopher\'s Stone?\"

\"Not likely. Not with the knowledge that all of the professors have set traps to prevent one from doing just that. He would have to be more foolish than I remember him to think a squib capable of such a thing. I think it much more likely that he was using Filch as a method of surveillance.\" His stare turned accusatory. \"Something I think you are somehow well aware of.\"

Dumbledore nodded slowly. \"Yes,\" he said with the air of one discussing the next day\'s weather. \"I believe that to be a perfectly reasonable and altogether likely conclusion to the night\'s events.\"

\"Yet you do nothing?\"

\"Oh, I am doing something, I assure you. There is an artifact on the way which will make Quirinus, or anyone else for that matter, much less likely candidates of ever being able to steal the Philosopher\'s Stone.\"

\"What is this artifact?\"

\"I cannot say. I trust you completely, but there are some things I cannot speak of. Increasing the probability of a leak would be foolish.\"

\"You think I would leak your secret or that any would be capable of pulling it from my mind?\"

\"I am certain you would never do such a thing and I very much doubt the latter to be possible. I do much prefer to err on the side of caution, however, especially when dealing with such sensitive matters as the one we have at hand.\"

Snape\'s face was set in a hard line and his jaw was clenched very tightly. \"Very well,\" he said curtly. \"And what will happen until the artifact arrives?\"

\"I doubt a move will be made on the Philosopher\'s Stone before that time comes. I find the possibility to be slim to none.\"

\"And if you\'re wrong?\"

\"I think the cerberus will act as quite a strong deterrent. They are exceptionally rare creatures and their weaknesses are not well-known.\"

\"And if Quirrell discovers the creature\'s weakness?\"

\"The only people in the world with the knowledge of how to surpass this particular cerberus are myself and Hagrid. I am certainly not telling, and I find the possibility of Rubeus sharing that secret with Quirinus an altogether unlikely one.\"

Snape sneered, suddenly reminded of his now mangled leg. It had been patched up by Madam Pomfrey and he was currently enjoying the benefits of a pain-relief potion; he knew exactly how formidable that beast was.

As for the staff\'s ability to keep its weakness under wraps... he was less confident.

\"I cannot decide whether your optimism is more enviable than it is nauseating, or more nauseating than it is enviable. It is certainly naive above all else.\"

Dumbledore smiled thinly. \"I sometimes think you overestimate that optimism, Severus. I do admittedly tend to see the best in most people but, if you will forgive me saying, I usually tend to know far more about those people than the individuals judging them so unjustly.\"

Realizing this argument was lost, Snape changed tact. \"Speaking of judgement, do you buy the story put forth by Weasley, Longbottom, and Granger?\"

\"I think most of it is likely the truth. If the Longbottom heir really has been using his father\'s wand all this time, that certainly explains some of the concerns his professors have voiced. It is fortunate that he didn\'t use it longer. While the effects wouldn\'t have been detrimental, they might have been noticeable, under the precisely wrong circumstances.\" His eyes twinkled. \"As for Miss Granger running off after a mountain troll, I find the tale as amusing as it is unlikely, though I admit I know little of the girl.\"

\"I didn\'t believe a word of her fairytale.\"

\"No, I certainly wouldn\'t have expected you to. Nevertheless, the youngest Weasley is proving to be quite the interesting addition to Hogwarts.\"

\"He is interesting in the same way those juvenile demons he calls brothers are interesting. Interesting in the sense that they are deafeningly loud, sickeningly brash, and excessively chaotic without reason.\"

Dumbledore chuckled. \"Juvenile demons, did you call them?\" Snape nodded stiffly. \"An interesting profile for certain. I much prefer to think of them as particularly gifted students doing a remarkable job at playing the role of jester, but perhaps that\'s just me.\"

\"No matter what you want to call them, trouble seems to follow in their very wake. The youngest boy is no exception. The path of carnage he has left behind him in two months puts him on pace to top his brothers\' own performances, which is the last thing this school needs, especially now, of all years.\" His face twisted into something ugly. \"I would have expected this from Potter, but Weasley is proving more troublesome than I would like.\"

\"Ah yes, Harry. Such an interesting case. I have heard glowing reports from most of his professors, but you have yet to say a word on him in my presence. Truly, Severus, that is something I did not expect. Tell me, what do you think of him?\"

\"He has no gift for Potions. He is not an erumpent horn waiting to explode, but he is far from skillful. In that regard, he takes much more after his *father* than his mother.\"

The way Snape carefully enunciated and emphasized every syllable of the word \'father\' spoke volumes to how --- even now, years later --- he felt about the man in question.

Dumbledore\'s thin smile returned. \"I have seen the grades you have given him. This much, I could have judged on my own. I wanted to know what you thought of the boy. Not what you thought of the student.\"

\"He is... quiet,\" Snape admitted. \"He rarely speaks in my classroom and frankly, I am not nearly as starstruck by his imaginary prestige as the rest of you. I have much better things to do than spending my day constantly observing some overhyped brat.\"

Dumbledore\'s lips twitched. \"Naturally.\" He glanced back up at his clock. \"Is that all for tonight?\"

\"Why is the door not more carefully warded?\"

\"The Hogwarts wards are quite complex. Tying potent wards into the already present ward scheme would be no small feat.\" Both men knew all too well Dumbledore could do it if the need truly arose, but the man wasn\'t finished. \"More troubling, I am obligated to inform the Hogwarts Board of Governors about any large-scale changes I make in regards to the wards.\"

A look of knowing passed between the two men and Snape inclined his head, though his expression was tight.

\"Very well,\" he said shortly, standing to his feet. \"That will be all then.\"

\"Do continue to keep an eye on Quirinus,\" Dumbledore said idly as he pulled the stack of parchments back out from their place in the drawer. \"Especially whilst he is near young Harry.\"

\"I will be watching,\" Snape vowed, stepping out of the office with a contemplative expression marring his features.

What exactly was the real reason Dumbledore wasn\'t putting up more complex wards?

***November 2, 1991***

***The Entrance Hall***

***8:11 PM***

The sun had long since set by the time Neville returned to Hogwarts. He had been in Diagon Alley getting a new wand; one that was given the opportunity to choose him.

When his grandmother had first learned of the destruction of his father\'s wand, she had been far from pleased. Neville had been in Professor McGonagall\'s office when his Head of House had made the floo call, and his gran had looked for a second as though she might spout flames with the intensity of a Hungarian Horntail.

Professor McGonagall had succinctly explained the events leading up to the destruction of Frank Longbottom\'s wand whilst Neville cowered in a corner, just barely in sight of his gran\'s head in the fire. To his astonishment, her tone shifted almost as soon as she learned of what had actually happened. She was still clearly distraught about her son\'s wand being no more, but there was something else in her eyes and voice. It somehow seemed more positive to Neville. She had never looked at him in that way before, but it made him feel warm in a way he was not accustomed to.

Mr. Ollivander had been most pleased to see him. The old man\'s memory really must have been impeccable, for he mentioned having expected Neville back in August. That only made the first-year Gryffindor boy wonder whether or not Ollivander kept track of every child\'s birthday and when they would be starting Hogwarts. He supposed he might have only been doing it for the politically powerful or otherwise important children, but he somehow doubted it. Ollivander didn\'t really seem the type to spend that much time on politics.

Despite the old man\'s eccentricities, Neville had never been so happy as when his hand had closed around his new wand. It was made of cherry and the core was the tail hair from an old and majestic unicorn. That\'s what Ollivander had said, anyway. The surge of warmth that rushed up Neville\'s arm and filled his chest felt almost as though a miniature firework had been lit inside of him. It was an incredible feeling and it was one he had never experienced with his father\'s wand, which made him oddly sad.

He would still make the man proud. He was just doing it with a different wand. He liked to think Frank Longbottom would have wanted his son to succeed, and Neville had a feeling things were going to work just a little bit better this way. He was sure he wasn\'t suddenly going to turn into Merlin or any such nonsense, but he also had little doubt it would help. Especially after what Mr. Ollivander had said about the wand choosing the wizard. He had stressed quite strongly it did not work the other way around.

When they had finished, Augusta had elected for a meal at the Three Broomsticks in Hogsmeade as opposed to flooing Neville directly back into the castle.

She walked him up towards the oak front doors when they had finished, and Neville couldn\'t help but notice how bright the grounds nearest to the castle were in contrast to the rest of the land around them. The hundreds of lights streaming down from windows far above might as well have been rays of sunlight, so bright they were when their beams conjoined.

After hugging his gran goodbye and stepping into the Entrance Hall, Neville\'s face broke out into a wide grin at the sight before him.

Ron and Hermione were standing outside the Great Hall, obviously having waited there since the conclusion of dinner.

It was odd how quickly the three of them had come together in the two days since their fight against the troll. Ron and Neville had been friendly before then, but they hadn\'t exactly been friends, per se. Hermione had been an outsider altogether, and she had most definitely not spent time talking to Ron. Least of all after his rule-breaking nature had made him the youngest seeker in a century.

But some things just brought people together in odd ways that could never be explained. Apparently, fighting a fully-grown mountain troll together was one of them. They had basically been fused at the hips ever since and it filled Neville with a great deal of warmth to think of how things had changed so quickly.

As did the eager, curious expressions they wore, obviously wondering how his trip to Diagon Alley had gone.

Things were really starting to look up for Neville at Hogwarts.

\"Hey, mate,\" Ron said in a low whisper. \"We have something to tell you.\"

Neville\'s ears perked up. \"Oh?\"

\"Snape\'s leg is a mess... and we think we know what happened.\"

And just like that, Neville\'s year became far more complicated once again.

***November 9, 1991***

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***4:23 PM***

Harry\'s first time watching Quidditch was an experience he wasn\'t likely to forget. The horde of Hogwarts students that had ascended into the stands quickly split off into four sections, each of them holding the members of one of the four Hogwarts houses. This was not a requirement in any way, shape, or form, but it was done in such a routine manner that Harry could only assume it to be a long-standing tradition.

He took his seat with Draco and the others high in the Slytherin section. They had a bird\'s eye view of the pitch, and Harry watched and cheered loudly along with the rest of his housemates when Slytherin\'s Quidditch team streaked out onto the pitch --- being announced as the reigning champions of the past six years as they did so. Much of the school booed crassly, and Harry was forcefully reminded of what Diana had said to him about Slytherin\'s disadvantages and the house loyalty they inspired whilst the two of them had stood atop the handsome balcony.

Harry watched, transfixed, as the players all mounted their brooms at centre field and took to the sky.

It was like nothing he had ever seen before.

The figures high above shot through the air at such ludicrous speeds that Harry could barely make out some of them beyond distinguishing between green and red blurs. He was thankful he had read a bit about Quidditch during the summer, or else he might have been very lost. The rules weren\'t terribly complicated --- except for the ridiculous number of small technicalities that were seldom relevant --- but he thought he would have been so entranced by the magic of the game that he may never have grasped its rules without prior knowledge.

Less magical was the game\'s outcome, at least for Harry\'s liking.

It was clear that Slytherin was good, but it was just as painstakingly obvious that Gryffindor was just better. Their chasers played with coordination that left Harry dumbstruck. It was as if they knew where each other were at all times without looking. Slytherin\'s beaters --- two hulking boys named Derrick and Bole --- were so outclassed by the Weasley twins it was almost comical. Bletchley actually was a very good keeper, from what Harry could tell, but he was clearly no match for Oliver Wood.

And then there was Ron Weasley, who looked exceptionally nervous but slowly eased his way into the game.

Early on, he had tried to jump into the play and act as a fourth chaser. This was perfectly legal, except he didn\'t do it very well. It was clear he had the talent, he just played so erratically that he was more of a detriment than he was a help. He did eventually ease into the game but even then, he reacted to every small movement that Slytherin\'s seeker --- a seventh-year boy named Terence Higgs --- made. Draco rightfully pointed out that all Higgs would need to do was feint Weasley into the ground. At least, that sounded pretty good to Harry. He didn\'t know what it meant exactly, but it sounded impactful and useful, if a bit difficult.

Despite his shakiness, the youngest seeker in a century was obviously leaps and bounds ahead of Higgs in terms of pure flying ability.

Granted, pure flying ability was not what allowed him to make the rather bizarre catch that ended the game. As Draco would put it later, it was \"The single easiest catch I have ever seen.\" He had also called Weasley a talentless troll for not realizing what had happened. Harry wasn\'t sure about that last part, but it was a one-off jab, so he let it go.

The snitch had apparently flown up Weasley\'s sleeve as he dodged a bludger sent towards him by Matthew Derrick. He had flown around the pitch for at least another minute before realizing, and only because the snitch had become bored and sought to fly out of his sleeve. Weasley had made a wild swipe for it and actually missed, but he did manage to snag it on the second attempt and before Higgs could swoop down and steal it from him.

\"Ridiculous,\" sulked Draco once they had later returned to the Slytherin common room. \"Honestly, Higgs is completely useless! How do you lose to a seeker who doesn\'t even realize the snitch flew up his sleeve?\" Crabbe and Goyle snickered. \"Seriously,\" Draco went on, \"the idiot *still* almost fumbled the catch.\" His eyes gleamed. \"Next year, when I\'m on the team, I\'ll be sure to make sure Weasley realizes exactly how rubbish he really is. He\'ll learn he\'s just a worthless little blood traitor with a bit of luck.\"

\"Confident, are we?\" Theodore asked with a thin smile.

\"I don\'t need to be confident. Not when I\'m flying against a bumbling buffoon on a broom.\"

Pansy laughed along with Crabbe and Goyle. Theodore\'s thin smile stretched just a little bit, but Harry\'s did not.

\"Oi!\" said Draco. \"Where are you off to?\"

\"I just need a bit of air is all,\" lied Harry. \"I\'ve got a bad headache that I\'m gonna try and get rid of.\"

\"I can come with you,\" Pansy offered at once.

\"It\'s okay. Like I said, I have a headache. It might actually be best if you don\'t.\"

He didn\'t even make it all the way down the corridor before he sensed that he was being followed. This time, he wasn\'t nearly as surprised to see Diana following him.

\"I can leave if you\'d like,\" she offered. \"I heard what you told my brother, but I thought you might have just been making an excuse to get away. I\'ll leave if you actually have a headache.\"

\"It\'s... okay,\" Harry said unsurely.

He didn\'t have a headache at all, but he wasn\'t sure whether or not he wanted to be alone or whether he wanted the older girl\'s company. The one indisputable positive about this way was that he could ask her questions and hopefully have them answered.

\"What\'s a blood traitor?\"

Diana\'s step faltered for but a second before she regained her composure. It seemed to Harry that they were on the path back to the balcony they had spoken on last time they had shared one of these moments.

\"It\'s... a derogatory term used by traditionalists to describe certain witches or wizards.\"

Harry frowned. \"I sort of figured that part out, but what does it mean?\"

\"It\'s... complicated.\" She seemed to choose her words very carefully as they ascended the stairs out of the dungeons. \"How much do you know about wizarding traditions?\"

Harry thought about that for a moment. \"Not as much as I\'d like,\" he admitted. \"I know that a lot of purebloods call Halloween Samhain, and I know that Yule is used instead of Christmas.\"

\"Those are good examples. Basic, but good. Others would be some of the more formal etiquette and whatnot.\" Harry nodded along. \"Well, a family like mine takes traditions very seriously. We follow all of the old rites and my mother, in particular, is very strict about etiquette. It\'s one of the first things Draco and I were ever taught.\" Harry nodded once more. \"Some families, like mine, hold these traditions very closely, and it upsets some purebloods when others don\'t follow them.\" She frowned. \"Even more so when people actively go against those traditions.\"

\"So is that what a blood traitor is?\"

\"Basically, yes. It\'s a witch or wizard raised in our world who ignores or, in some cases, goes against our traditions.\" Diana peered warily towards him as they stepped through the passage that would lead them out onto the balcony they had occupied during their last conversation. \"I\'m guessing Draco said it about Weasley?\"

\"He did, yeah. He\'s... not pleased.\"

Diana laughed quietly. \"No, I doubt he is. Most in our house aren\'t pleased, but I bet Draco is extra annoyed. He seemed to think father would be able to get him a spot on the house team, even though --- at least until Weasley --- no first year had even been allowed a tryout in decades. None of them had actually made the team in a century.\"

\"Yeah, he called him a talentless troll.\"

Diana laughed once more as the two of them stepped out into the cool November air. \"It was a *very* lucky catch, but I don\'t know if I\'d go that far. He\'s a good flyer; he just needs to calm down a bit.\" Harry nodded.

\"All of the Weasleys are called blood traitors by a lot of purebloods,\" Diana eventually told him. \"They go against all of the pureblood ways, their children never follow any of the etiquette, from what I can tell, and their lord is Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.\"

\"The... what?\" Harry had read up a bit on the ministry and he was sure this was a part of it, but he hadn\'t heard it mentioned. It just sounded like an overly ostentatious position that a self-important governing body would come up with.

\"The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office,\" Diana explained with a smile that was obviously threatening to become a laugh. \"I\'m not surprised you\'ve never heard of it. It\'s a sub-branch of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Everything I\'ve heard about it makes it sound next to useless. Father says their office is literally an old broom cupboard, but I\'m not sure if he was being serious.\"

\"That sounds awful!\"

Diana shrugged. \"As I said, the office sounds pretty useless. They don\'t seem to do much. Father says it\'s a wonder the ministry even funds them. Either way, the lord of House Weasley, Arthur, is the department\'s head. He\'s obsessed with anything and everything muggle if what I\'ve heard is true. Father calls him the ultimate blood traitor from time to time.\"

\"Is the word... wrong?\"

Diana seemed to think about that. \"Wrong in what way?\"

\"Like... should we be saying it?\"

\"It\'s not the kindest word. There are worse ones, but it\'s bad enough to offend someone.\" She hesitated. \"I don\'t know if it\'s wrong though. The meaning is pretty on point. There are a lot of families who go completely against the old ways. Arguments can be made that it\'s done a lot of bad for the world. I\'m sure there are arguments the other way too, but if the term is wrong or not in terms of what it means is sort of up to the person.\"

That explanation made some sense to Harry, though he had no idea how he felt about the word\'s validity. He couldn\'t comprehend why anyone would act more muggle than wizard, but he wasn\'t sure if that made it right.

Every muggle he had ever met had been at least partially an awful human being. Except for some spiteful Gryffindors, most of the witches and wizards Harry had met were miles nicer than any of the muggles. If he had his pick, he was going wizard all the way, and he couldn\'t think for the life of him why anybody would choose differently. He could actually see why it annoyed some wizards. It implied they were worse off than muggles, which, judging on how horrid muggles were, was something Harry thought them at least a bit justified in being upset over.

Whether that made the term right or not... he wasn\'t sure.

\"If you want to learn more about traditions, I\'d be happy to help.\" Diana smiled at Harry\'s eager-looking expression. \"I\'m sure my parents would, too. They told me to pass along an invitation to come over for the Yuletide break.\"

Harry\'s heart leapt into his throat. No... that wasn\'t a strong enough analogy. Harry\'s heart almost leapt out of his mouth.

\"They... they did?\"

Diana nodded, a sad smile playing at the corners of her lips. \"They did, yes. They\'re actually eager to meet you for more than a couple of minutes on a train platform. I think they\'re going to send a letter about it to Professor Snape, just so he knows what to expect.\"

\"They\'re... sure?\"

Diana fixed Harry with a hard stare. \"Just because those muggles treated you so horribly, that doesn\'t mean the rest of us will.\"

Her voice was soft and confident and it very obviously brook no argument. Harry found it difficult to believe such things at all, but her tone almost made him believe it anyway.

\"They were horrible people,\" continued Diana. \"I don\'t know what they did, but I don\'t need to know. I haven\'t seen anything bad about you. Anyone who would treat a child like that is a monster.\"

Harry nearly leapt out of his skin when her hand landed on his shoulder. He tensed, which made Diana frown, but she left her hand firmly in place.

\"You\'re in a better place now. None of us are going to treat you that way. You might be my brother\'s best friend, and I\'ve gotten along really well with you too. Hell, even Cassius likes you, and Cassius doesn\'t like most people.\" She giggled at this last part. \"He actually looked annoyed about it. Anyway, the point is, you\'re wanted here. There\'s no need to look so surprised.\"

Numbly, Harry nodded.

\"If you\'re ready,\" said Diana, removing her hand from his shoulder and turning back towards the castle\'s interior, \"we should get back inside. It\'s cold out here.\"

Harry nodded and they began the descent back down into the dungeons.

***The Potions Classroom***

***11:58 AM***

The sound of simmering cauldrons began to die as the Potions class came to an end. With it went the vapour that had been hanging seductively around the room, looming persistently in the air.

\"Potter!\" snapped their Head of House. \"Stay behind!\"

Harry and Snape\'s relationship since that first Potions lesson back in September could accurately be described as uneventful. Whenever possible, it seemed as though Snape tried to pretend that Harry didn\'t exist. Harry thought this was blatantly unfair.

Draco, Pansy, Theodore, and basically anyone who so much as breathed whilst wearing Slytherin robes had points showered on them with the frequency of falling raindrops. Harry, on the other hand, rarely heard so much as a word from the Potions Master. It was better than the horrendous treatment of the Gryffindors, but Harry wouldn\'t have been at all opposed to receiving the same preferential treatment that was enjoyed by every other member of his house.

He often wondered what he had done to offend Snape in the first place. He only ever remembered being respectful, but he somehow thought he was missing something. Even at the welcoming feast, before Harry had ever even spoken a word to the man, Snape had seemed poised and ready to despise him on principle. He supposed being blatantly ignored was better than that, but it did make him a bit bitter.

Harry found himself terribly surprised that Friday morning after he was called to stay behind after their double period. It was most unlike Snape based on the trend of pretending Harry didn\'t exist, and he suddenly wondered if something catastrophic had happened. He couldn\'t think why else Snape might have called for a meeting, of sorts.

\"You wanted to speak with me, sir?\"

Snape\'s lip curled. \"Wanted is a strong word, but I think there is something you should at least be made aware of.\" He slid open one of the drawers on his desk and withdrew a pristine-looking envelope from inside. \"This,\" he said, \"is a letter I received from Lucius Malfoy on Wednesday. I was... surprised to learn that he had invited you to spend the Yuletide break at his home.\" Snape levelled him with a hard gaze. \"It would be advisable for you to send him a letter professing your... intense appreciation.\"

Harry nodded quickly just as he noticed Snape\'s expression become more pensive. \"I think it prudent for me to inform you that accepting Lord Malfoy\'s invitation may not be quite as simple as you might think.\"

Harry felt confusion bubble in the pit of his stomach. \"What do you mean, sir?\"

\"What I mean, Potter, is that you will not be permitted to leave this castle for extended periods of time without the expressed permission of your legal guardians. That doesn\'t suddenly change because of the holiday season being in full swing.\"

Dread closed tightly around Harry\'s throat. It seemed to do its best to strangle him, as he felt all of the air torn painfully and suddenly from his lungs.

He would need to get the Dursleys\' permission to go to Malfoy Manor.

One of the things he had most looked forward to about entering into the wizarding world was the fact the Dursleys would no longer have power over him. Finding out that fact wasn\'t true was actually far more crushing than the likely implications that he would be unable to accept the Malfoys\' invitation.

\"I suggest you write to your relatives,\" said Snape. \"Do so quickly; time is running out. Official words must be given on your holiday plans in the coming weeks.\"

Harry nodded morosely as he was carelessly dismissed. He wondered if Snape understood just how crushing that proclamation had been. Or, if he did, whether or not he even cared.

***November 21, 1991***

***The Library***

***7:52 PM***

Harry found himself the only member of his group in the library the Thursday after his post-Potions discussion with Snape. The Dursleys had not yet written back. Not that their answer was even remotely in doubt. The only thing that had Harry vaguely curious was whether or not they would dignify him with a response. He quietly thought they would, if only to spite him needlessly. It seemed like exactly the sort of thing Uncle Vernon would do.

Tonight, he was alone in the library because Theodore had wanted to practice spells that night. Ironically, Harry actually did have quite the nasty migraine this time. Of course, staring down at a book wasn\'t particularly conducive to ridding himself of the ailment, but it was better than the cacophony of noise that was likely filling whichever room his friends were using to house their practice.

Harry was just looking over a book on Charms when a high, squeaky voice rang out from behind him.

\"I\'m glad to see that you\'re taking an interest in the theory of Charms.\" Harry nearly jumped out of his chair, but he managed to maintain the vast majority of his composure. Flitwick obviously noticed, for he offered Harry an apologetic smile. \"So sorry, dear boy. I didn\'t mean to scare you. Just making an observation was all.\"

\"It\'s okay, Professor,\" said Harry, feeling his heart rate slow back down to a more reasonable cadence. \"I just didn\'t expect you, that\'s all.\"

Flitwick smiled conspiratorially. \"Believe it or not, there are a great many books in this library. I doubt even Albus has come close to reading all of them. I am also a Ravenclaw at heart, so I spend more time taking books out from here than you might expect.\"

Harry nodded slowly; it made sense. \"What were you saying about the theory, sir?\"

\"Ah yes, that,\" said Flitwick, straightening his posture and suddenly looking quite satisfied. \"You are a remarkable student. I know Minerva has told you as much as well, and I wouldn\'t doubt Quirinus has done the same.\" Harry blushed, but Flitwick either didn\'t notice or was too polite to point it out. Harry was hedging his bets on the latter.

\"You are exceptionally talented. I would go as far as to say you have an intuitive sense for magic, which is something that I seldom see. You have been a joy to teach, but your standing in my class should actually be much higher than it is.\"

Harry felt some concern solidify in his chest as he stared worriedly back towards Flitwick. \"Is it not good, Professor?\"

Flitwick chuckled. \"Oh, it is excellent, but it should be much better. As we speak, I believe you\'re on a similar footing to Miss Granger; maybe just a touch or two above her.\"

\"That\'s good?\"

\"You\'re the top two students for your year in my class, Harry.\"

He frowned. \"Then how could it be better?\"

\"Because, with all due respect to Miss Granger, the two of you should not be close. She is remarkably intelligent; one of the brightest minds I have ever had the pleasure of teaching. Very determined, too, and she has such a curious mind.\" Flitwick looked pointedly from Harry to the book sitting in front of him on the desk. \"What she doesn\'t have is your ability. You are very far ahead in the practical side of Charms, but there is more to magic than waving your wand and making things happen. Understanding magic is just as important as using it. That\'s what lets you push further as a wizard. It\'s what lets you evolve, mature, and truly master magic. Without the understanding, you will go only as far as your classes and textbooks take you.\"

\"Is my theory work not good, sir?\"

\"It\'s more than passable, but it is very far behind what I would expect from someone of your ability.\" His look turned reassuring when he saw Harry\'s own face fall. \"Your grades are still exceptional on the count of your theory alone, Master Potter. All that I am saying is that you have the potential to be something more. You have the potential to be so much more. It is potential you won\'t ever reach without putting in the work to truly understand the magic. I would hate to see such potential go to waste, and I\'m sure your other professors would tell you the same thing.\"

He was right, of course. Just last week, Harry had performed the Transfiguration they had been assigned with ease. Professor McGonagall had praised him. She had awarded him points and even compared him to his father; who had apparently been some sort of prodigy in the subject. What she had also said echoed what Professor Flitwick said.

\"*If your theoretical work ever catches up to your practical ability, you will doubtlessly be the most talented student I have ever taught.\"*

Harry remembered his conversation with Diana about the term \'blood traitor\'. He remembered how during that conversation, he had wondered why one wouldn\'t want to learn all they could about the magical world and immerse themselves in its culture. This was his home. He wanted it to be his home more badly than he wanted anything else in the entire world. He wanted to differentiate himself from the muggles as much as he possibly could.

He could think of no better way to do that than to understand the one thing they themselves could never wield.

\"I\'ll try harder, Professor,\" Harry vowed. \"I\'ll do my best to better understand.\"

Flitwick smiled warmly right before he exited the room. \"Jolly good! Do come to me if you ever have any questions.\"

Then, he left.

***December 1, 1991***

***The Headmaster\'s Office***

***8:44 PM***

Albus Dumbledore looked up from his letter with a passive yet pleased expression.

\"Very good,\" he mused, looking to his phoenix, who seemed to be eyeing him with what he thought resembled curiosity. \"It is on the way,\" he told it with a soft smile, eliciting a soft note of ethereal music from the bird.

That single note warmed Dumbledore more than he could describe. His very blood seemed to heat up as his skin tingled.

But even that didn\'t warm nor assure him as much as the contents of his letter.

The mirror would arrive soon.

***December 9, 1991***

***The Great Hall***

***8:41 AM***

The layer of snow which had blanketed Hogwarts for some time now had thickened over the past week or so. There had been two fairly significant snowfalls and by now, Harry would easily concede that there was more snow at Hogwarts than he had ever seen at one time in his life.

Aside from that, not much had changed inside the castle.

He had taken Flitwick\'s advice and spent more time studying magical theory, and he had immediately noticed some increases in his practical work, even if they were --- at least for now --- marginal. He actually understood the concepts without a terrible degree of difficulty after looking into them, it was just a matter of actually doing so. He didn\'t plan on exerting that much effort into classes such as Astronomy, but it did seem to be an admittedly valid way for him to progress in the wanded subjects.

Otherwise, the norm had largely been maintained.

His group of friends remained mostly the same. There had been a week or so after Harry\'s conversation with Diana during which Draco had been a touch withdrawn. This mirrored a similar instance earlier in the year after their first conversation pertaining to Draco\'s treatment of Neville Longbottom and Ron Weasley. This stretch had been awkward both times, but Draco had gotten over it quickly enough. Harry was beginning to see a pattern and he suspected that Diana was likely having words with her younger brother. What those words were, exactly, he was unsure.

Snape was making his way down the Slytherin table this morning and it only took Harry a couple of seconds to realize why. The time had come for students to specify whether or not they would be remaining in the castle over the winter break. It was a day Harry had been dreading for some time. Ever since Snape had informed him of the Dursleys\' necessary involvement in him leaving the castle, but especially since their return letter had arrived just a few days later.

It was curt but had stated in no uncertain terms that they would not be going out of their way to sign any forms for him. Obviously desiring to save themselves another letter, they had enclosed Harry\'s Christmas gift early --- a fifty-pence piece --- as well as a postscript telling him to ask whether or not it would be possible for him to remain at Hogwarts over the summer holidays.

It was perhaps the first bit of agreeable advice the Dursleys had ever given him. If the option to do just that was there, Harry would absolutely be taking it.

He loved the castle and would crave nothing more than using it to escape the Dursleys forever, but he presently felt unsatisfied at Hogwarts for the first time since his arrival.

Perhaps unsatisfied wasn\'t the right word.

It just felt wrong staying while almost all of his friends were returning home for the holidays. The lone exception to the rule was Cassius Warrington, with whom Harry had formed a tentative friendship ever since the older boy had seen Harry fly.

Writing his regretful letter to the Malfoys stating that he would be unable to accept their invitation of hospitality had been painful, but telling Draco was going to be even worse. It was something Harry had thus far put off, but with Snape parading around the table, list in hand, the time for procrastination had unfortunately come to an abrupt and sudden end.

Snape noted down the plans for all of Harry\'s friends before turning to him. Harry could tell Snape was somehow interested in the answer, even though his face was as blank as ever. \"And you, Potter?\"

\"I\'ll be staying at Hogwarts, sir.\"

\"What?\" asked Draco, head snapping around so fast his blonde hair flew across his forehead.

\"The muggles didn\'t sign the form,\" Harry muttered, doing so in a voice quiet enough that he hoped no one else would hear.

\"That\'s rubbish,\" said Draco, turning pleading eyes on Snape. \"You\'re hearing this, Professor? Surely a bunch of muggles can\'t tell the Boy-Who-Lived where he can and can\'t stay for Yule.\"

\"I\'m afraid they can, Mister Malfoy. By law, they are his guardians, thus Hogwarts must bow to their wishes in such matters.\"

\"What if I appealed to my father?\"

\"It would do nothing in such a short time. So long as they are his guardians, nothing is to be done.\" Snape swept off before Draco could get in another retort.

\"Tossers,\" he cursed under his breath, his grey eyes stormy and filled with obvious fury. \"I\'m really sorry, Harry. I can still try to write Father. Snape is a teacher; he\'s no solicitor. Maybe he\'s overlooked something.\"

\"Thanks, Draco, but it\'s okay. I wouldn\'t want to bother your father with something like this.\"

Draco opened his mouth, obviously intent on arguing, but didn\'t get a chance to begin.

\"Let it drop, Malfoy.\" The voice came from a boy whom Harry didn\'t know by name, but whom he thought to be a second year. \"If the halfblood\'s own family doesn\'t even want him, I doubt a man like your father would ever be bothered.\"

Harry felt as though he had been slapped.

He was no fool; he had gauged the mood just fine after his sorting into Slytherin. The opinions were heavily divided --- even within his own house. He was pretty sure that had it not been for his friendship with Draco, Theodore, and Pansy, he would have had a much more difficult time than he had been having so far. Even so, he saw the way some of the students looked at him. They were mostly upper years, but their expressions did not exactly speak positive things. Harry could vividly remember thinking that the stare levelled at him by one particular upper-year girl looked very much like how he might study an excessively slimy bug.

Harry must have given away at least some of his thoughts through his expression, because the boy\'s lips curled up into a malicious smirk.

\"Oh, come on, Potter. Surely you\'re not daft enough to think you\'re special just because you have a stupid scar? I know your yearmates have been all buddy-buddy, but we don\'t usually put up with your type here.\"

\"My type?\" asked Harry, doing an admirable job at keeping his voice steady.

\"The son of a blood traitor and a mudblood.\"

Harry felt an odd twinge of anger at this boy\'s words. Conceptually, he knew it was irrational. He had never known either of his parents and he had no memories of them except for what he suspected to be his mother\'s final moments. That somehow still didn\'t change the fact that anger pulsed within him at these last words, never mind the fact he didn\'t know what a mudblood was.

His hand twitched towards his wand, but he resisted the impulse. The boy\'s friends were eyeing the situation warily, and Harry doubted they could take a group of second years. Even if they could, an open duel in the Great Hall likely wouldn\'t go over well at all.

Somebody came up behind the boy and rested a hand on his shoulder. He turned to see who it was before suddenly sobering. \"Fawley.\"

\"Travers,\" the girl returned, her eyes flitting between him and Harry. \"Let\'s not spout off about blood supremacy in the Great Hall, yes? It doesn\'t exactly paint us --- or you --- in the best of lights. If you have a problem, you know how it should be handled.\"

Travers nodded hastily and muttered an apology before he and his friends left the hall.

The girl was one Harry recognized, if vaguely. Her name was Gemma Fawley and she was the Head Girl this year. She was of average height with light brown hair and sea-green eyes. She had soft facial features that were always very well-modulated and Harry now learned from being under her stare that her eyes had a certain, penetrating quality to them, as if they were seeing more than just his irises.

\"Do be careful, Potter. Travers is no genius, but he\'s far from incompetent. If he\'s anything like the rest of his family, he\'s also impulsive and spiteful. Between the two of us and your friends, that\'s a dangerous combination, especially where you\'re concerned. Come and speak with myself or one of the prefects if he does anything too horribly out of line.\"

Harry nodded curtly as she left, trying not to show exactly how much that comment had bothered him.

As if he needed anything else unpleasant to think about that morning.

***December 13, 1991***

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***10:13 PM***

Harry and his friends returned to the common room after a fairly long Friday night practice. It was still a matter of fact that every Friday night, the boys --- occasionally, but not always accompanied by Pansy --- would practice their spell work. Their female friend usually remained in the common room --- probably to keep up with the ever-churning Hogwarts rumour mill.

This particular night had gone pretty well for all involved except for Harry. He had still easily performed the best --- even if Theodore had done well, as he always did --- but Harry knew he could have performed better.

He was just... distracted.

He had been on and off lately; ever since Travers\'s verbal assault in the Great Hall four days ago. To make matters worse, some of the second and even a few of the third year Slytherins had begun hitting him with minor jinxes in the corridors any time no one was watching. They hadn\'t today, as Draco had practically ordered Crabbe and Goyle to escort Harry everywhere. The two of them may not have been Merlin with a wand, but they damn sure struck an imposing visage. One that many clearly didn\'t want to cross, for it had been by far Harry\'s most peaceful day since the incident in the Great Hall.

Though that certainly was a contributing factor to his stress, it wasn\'t actually the thing that had him most wound up.

He had sat behind Greengrass and Davis in History of Magic and listened to the former lecture the latter on the importance of assigning the proper gift to the proper person, even if it was a small thing.

Harry had become immediately concerned.

He hadn\'t even really considered giving gifts. He had of course been aware of the fast-approaching holiday season, but the impulse to consider gift-giving had never even arisen. Probably because before now, Harry had never been in a position where giving gifts had been plausible. It wasn\'t really something one could do while locked up in a cupboard and living meal to meal.

Even if he had considered it, Greengrass\'s lecture would have worried him.

How on earth was he, a muggle-raised student --- and not an overly social one at that --- supposed to understand how to buy gifts for purebloods who had virtually everything they had ever wanted?

According to Greengrass, one could make a right fool of themself if they chose gifts wrong, which was something Harry was more than a touch concerned about.

Harry and his friends sat around the fire for some time after their return to the common room and Harry couldn\'t help but notice the way Pansy\'s gaze kept finding him every time he looked away for more than a moment.

\"Harry?\"

\"Mhm,\" hummed Harry, looking up from his book on Transfiguration theory and towards Pansy, who had spoken.

\"If I go and get my things for the essay we owe McGonagall next week, can you help me with it?\"

Pansy really was rubbish at Transfiguration compared to the rest of them, with the exceptions of Crabbe and Goyle, but Harry felt that something else was afoot here. Something likely relating to the odd glances she had repeatedly been sparing him since he had re-entered the common room.

\"Sure.\"

Pansy stood and gestured a bit hesitantly for Harry to join her. He wasn\'t sure that he would be able to enter her dorm, but he shrugged and stood anyway, following her out of the common room\'s main sitting area. He had no doubt she really did want help on that essay, but he thought this gesture may be leading to her other purpose. Harry had by now spent enough time around Slytherins to begin understanding how they worked, after all.

\"Are you all right?\" she asked him once they were alone. He had chosen to refrain from questioning her on the course of action she had chosen.

\"I\'m fine, yeah.\"

\"You seem stressed.\"

Pansy might not have had his or Theodore\'s academic prowess, but she was very gifted when it came to reading people; him in particular. This wasn\'t the first time she had made that obvious, but he found himself constantly reminded of the fact.

\"A bit, I guess.\"

\"About what happened with Travers?\"

He hesitated. \"Yeah...\"

\"That doesn\'t sound very confident.\"

\"It\'s... more than one thing.\"

\"Hmm?\"

Harry pierced her with his most intense stare. \"If I tell you, will you promise not to tell Draco and the others?\"

\"Of course.\" The snobbish way with which she answered --- lip curled, posture straight, and nose upturned --- made it seem as though the question itself had been foolish.

\"I... heard Greengrass telling Davis all about how the right gift should be given to the right person and about how you can look like a total prat if you mess it up. I have no idea about any of that and I don\'t even know how to get ahold of presents while we\'re stuck up inside the castle.\"

Harry looked down at the floor, worried Pansy might react in a similarly snobbish manner to how she had answered his previous question. He worried she might look at him with disdain or sigh exasperatedly at his ignorance.

As it turned out, she did none of these things.

\"Oh, Harry, I\'m *so* glad you asked!\" When she actually sounded excited of all things, Harry looked up and found himself surprised by what he saw. A gleam in her eye; one akin to that of a child who had just spotted the most interesting toy on display. \"See? This is why you should tell me these things. You came to the *perfect* person for this.\"

Idly, Harry couldn\'t help but wonder exactly what he had just gotten himself into.

***December 21, 1991***

***The Entrance Hall***

***10:24 AM***

Harry walked with his friends --- both those from his year as well as Diana and her group --- as they made their way down to the entrance hall and readied themselves to board the train which would take them back to London. On their way down, they saw Hagrid hefting what had to be a magically enlarged Christmas tree towards the Great Hall\'s entrance.

The sight of the giant man gave Harry some pause. He had treated him so well in Diagon Alley, but the two of them had barely spoken since. They would exchange the odd greeting if the pair encountered one another in the corridors, but these occasions were scarce. Other than that, they hadn\'t shared any interactions since Harry\'s arrival at the castle. At least none the boy could remember. This all somehow seemed wrong after the way Harry had been introduced to the magical world and he made a mental note to remedy such a thing at his earliest possible convenience.

Harry allowed himself one passing glance inside the Great Hall, where he noticed Professors Flitwick and McGonagall setting up some more elaborate decorations. It was beginning to look like a winter wonderland, with fake snow falling from the enchanted ceiling high above and vibrant decor quickly spreading throughout the massive room.

The sight of his friends leaving the castle minutes later was far less pleasing, and Harry found himself hating the Dursleys perhaps more than he had ever hated them before. It was odd, as they had done things in the past that would generally be viewed as far more atrocious than this. What many people may have failed to take into account was that for the first time in Harry\'s life, they had actually deprived him of something more than just his own, selfish desires.

They had deprived him of friendship, which in a way just spoke of how far Harry had already come whilst away from their oppressive practices.

He tensed at the hand on his shoulder and had to resist the impulse to turn away as he glanced to see Cassius staring at him with an expression of deep understanding.

\"Hey, it\'ll be all right. They\'re only gone for about two weeks. That sounds like a lot, but it\'ll pass quickly enough.\" He grinned. \"Care to make it pass even faster?\" Reluctantly intrigued, Harry tilted his head, asking Cassius a silent question while doing so. \"Well, I think it\'s time for the two of us to actually go out flying. I\'ve been wanting to put you through your paces ever since that first day I saw you out with Draco.\"

Most of the thoughts pertaining to the Dursleys and his friends were wiped immediately away, and Harry couldn\'t help but allow a smile to blossom across his face. \"Sure, you\'re on!\"

***Later that night, at Malfoy Manor...***

The rural areas of Wiltshire were vast. One could go in any direction for what felt like an eternity and find nothing at all. It was full of open fields and dense forests that never seemed to end.

If one did travel far enough in a very specific direction, however --- assuming they weren\'t a muggle impacted by a number of privacy wards --- they would stumble across a truly magnificent sight.

They would first come to a gravel driveway flanked on either side by hedges taller than the average man. If they followed this curved drive, it would take them to the foot of towering, wrought-iron gates that were as dark as obsidian. On this particular night, a pair of pristine-looking peacocks perched atop the gates in a similar fashion to how a number of their fellows did so at near-uniform intervals on the handsome hedges. Behind these loomed a sight with the potential to take one\'s breath away.

Expansive, lush lawns stretched out on all sides and in the distance, well-kept forests could be seen. There was even a lake which, in the daylight, sparkled in the light as if it was but a sheet of glass.

None of that was the main attraction, however.

The main attraction was the expansive manor that dominated the land\'s massive centre, towering above all other things in the area and casting them easily into its shadow. The handsome house was surrounded by breathtaking gardens that would not have been out of place in fabled tales of mythology. Near the house\'s front entrance, a large, modern-looking fountain quietly spouted water, adding to the rich image of tranquility that the entire scene gave off.

The inside of the manor was just as splendid as the outside, if not even more so.

The manor\'s general feel was of wealth and darkness. The floor in Malfoy Manor was done in a dark, rich-looking wood. Soft, pale drapings obscured large glass windows on either side of a somewhat circular staircase that converged in the centre of a balcony on the next floor, which overlooked the entrance hall itself. The pale, cream curtains cast a soft, yet ominous light across the otherwise lowly-lit hall. In the relative darkness, the staircase\'s railings --- which appeared to be made of pure gold --- glinted sinisterly, if such a thing was at all possible for such rich material.

Beneath the staircase, there was a life-sized portrait depicting the current four members of the Malfoy family, noses upturned, heads held high and surrounded by a gilded, ornate frame.

Up this staircase and down a number of corridors was a rich oak door. One that led to the house\'s most secure room; one that not even the house elves could enter without expressed permission.

In the room sat various portraits of former Malfoy lords, as well as a number of them that didn\'t portray people, but significant events in the family\'s history. The largest portrait of all hung behind the dark oak desk which was one of the room\'s distinguishing features. The portrait\'s background was velvety black, with a number of great snakes depicted in emerald green curling in its centre, underneath which words were written in a silvery, serpentine script.

*Sanctimonia Vincet Semper*

Two comfortable, high-backed chairs sat across the desk from the family crest\'s depiction, in front of which sat the family\'s lord. In the two chairs before him were his children, both of whom wondering exactly why they had been called here together. One of them --- the eldest and family\'s heiress --- had only ever been called into this room a handful of times. Her younger brother could only remember one instance; the day before he had been sent to Hogwarts to begin his formal magical education.

\"I trust you left nothing of significance unsaid during the retellings of your first semester at Hogwarts?\" Lucius Malfoy paused. \"Except for the information I asked you not to vocalize prominently in front of your mother?\" Both children nodded and Lucius leant forward, folding his hands in front of him on the desk. \"Good. Now, is there anything... interesting either of you would like to tell me about Mister Potter?\"

***December 25, 1991***

***The Slytherin Dorms***

***7:37 AM***

Harry had greatly enjoyed flying with Cassius the morning his friends had left Hogwarts, and he had learned plenty during their exploits. They had spent most of the past number of days together and Harry could honestly say he was now closer to Cassius than anyone else who wasn\'t named Draco, Pansy, or Diana.

Just before going to bed on the eve of Yule, Cassius had asked Harry to wait for him before opening their presents, which he said would be waiting at the foot of Harry\'s bed the morning of the 25th. Harry still found the thought of presents odd, but he didn\'t say that to Cassius. Had it not been for the fact he knew at least several of his friends had bought him gifts, he would likely have been surprised by the pile that awaited him upon his waking that next morning.

He had to wait quite some time for Cassius, which began to make him impatient. It was the first time in living memory he had ever received gifts and he was eager to tear into them.

In the end, he decided to read while he waited, since he knew Cassius was *not* a morning person. He frequently slept in well past ten on weekends, but Harry had warned him not to do that this morning. If the time ticked past eight, he had said, he would be opening his gifts, whether Cassius liked it or not.

The boy cut it close, sauntering into the room whilst clearly in quite a dazed state at about twenty minutes before the cut-off time. Cassius was levitating his own pile of gifts and the two of them exchanged but a brief greeting before bearing down on their respective hauls.

Harry first opened heaping boxes of sweets from Crabbe and Goyle before going through a number of token gifts from his yearmates and, strangely, the Quidditch team.

The first semi-notable gift came from Pansy, who had sent Harry several boxes packed with all different kinds of clothing, both wizard and muggle. The latter had surprised him, but according to the attached note, Pansy\'s family were majority stakeholders in a notable muggle fashion company. Theodore sent him a book on what seemed like some interestingly questionable curses, and Draco sent him a leather-bound, gold-embroidered, collector\'s edition copy of *Quidditch Through the Ages.* Cassius had gone a similar route, choosing a more strategy-based book on the major sport of the wizarding world.

Harry couldn\'t help but think it odd how many of these gifts linked to Quidditch in some way. It wasn\'t something he had expected, nor was it something he understood.

Hagrid sent him a wooden flute that was obviously hand-carved. It was a relief to Harry, as he had sent Hagrid several boxes of sweets and a letter asking whether or not the man would be amiable to catching up that afternoon. Hagrid\'s affirmative reply was also enclosed, which allowed Harry to at least take comfort in the fact that he hadn\'t ruined his first magical friendship.

The next three gifts were from the other three members of the Malfoy family and they all surprised Harry in different ways.

Narcissa had sent him a book on wizarding genealogy and a note enclosed wishing him well that gently suggested that he look into his family history. Diana had opted to send two books. One was an intermediate tome on magical theory and one discussed the Dark Arts, which made Harry\'s eyes widen comically. From the brief skim of the table of contents, the book didn\'t so much teach them as much as it did explain them.

The one that elicited the largest response from Cassius came from Lucius. It was a heavy watch made of pure gold and there were obviously diamonds in the design. It was just as flamboyant and over the top as one might expect from the Malfoy family. It worked in the same way as the magical clocks Harry had been so interested in on the first day, only to find out they worked the same as the muggle ones; they were just done up in a fancier manner and presented as a groundbreaking discovery.

\"What is it?\" Harry asked Cassius, noticing the way he kept eyeing the watch.

\"It\'s... well, it\'s honestly best if you learn for yourself. Go and look up customs between lords and heirs in one of the etiquette books. It should give you an idea. It\'s not a bad thing,\" he assured his younger friend. \"Just... not what I would have expected.\"

The second to last present confused Harry more than anything. For one thing, he certainly hadn\'t expected Gemma Fawley to send him anything. For another, he had no idea why she would send him a book that --- thanks to his reading *The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts* --- he knew to be discussing Gellert Grindelwald\'s war.

*The Blood War: What Really Happened?*

That was one Harry conceded he would need to think upon later. He still had one more gift left to open and it was really best if he refocused his attention on that for now.

The final present Harry had laid out on his bed was a small one; only a pristine-looking envelope. On its back was a crest; one Harry recognized as belonging to one of the most prominent families in the country. He had seen it while studying his copy of *Nature\'s Nobility: A Guide to Wizarding Genealogy* back in the summer.

The crest depicted a night-time backdrop. Much of it was dominated by what appeared to be a field of roses, stretching from one side of the crest to another. In the centre, the roses contorted around an elegant glass of wine; a symbol for purity, while the constellation Ursa Major shone in the sky above, which was also occupied by a flock of ravens. At the bottom of the crest, in golden letters, were written the words *Toujours Pur.*

The letter read:

*Heir Potter:*

*I hope this letter finds you in the best of health and in good spirits. It is a pleasure to see you back in the wizarding world after all these years.*

*This letter has not been sent for any particular purpose, but more so as a formal letter of introduction, since you are one of the closest relatives I have left --- as depressing a thought as that is.*

*I would like to wish you a very happy holiday, encourage a reply, and formally welcome you back to the wizarding world on behalf of the Founding House of Black.*

*Yours truly,*

*Regulus Arcturus Black*

*Lord of the Founding House of Black*

***Hours later...***

Harry had spent more time in Hagrid\'s hut than he had expected. They had discussed much of Harry\'s first year at Hogwarts in detail, as well as a vast array of other things. Hagrid assured Harry he hadn\'t turned his back on him for something as simple as his sorting, even though he seemed to speak of the other Slytherins very carefully.

They had also discussed Harry\'s parents. Hagrid had heard about his prowess in both Charms and Transfiguration, so he likened him to Lily and James, who had specialized respectively in the two subjects.

By the time Harry had eaten dinner and left the hut, night had fallen and the temperature had done likewise. He was really quite tired, even though it was not yet terribly late. It had been a long day full of firsts and all of the new experiences had wound up being exhausting in their own way. He certainly hadn\'t expected a personal bit of correspondence from Lord Black, though the same could be said for a number of his gifts.

Little did he know, his night was not yet done.

When Harry entered his dormitory some time later, he noticed a new package on his bed; one that had not been there this morning.

He frowned. There was nobody else from his dormitory at Hogwarts and everyone who would have reasonably sent him gifts had already done so. He crept slowly towards it and eyed the packaging carefully. He briefly debated bringing it to Cassius and asking him to check it for curses. He didn\'t think Travers disliked him that much, but he wouldn\'t be shocked. He eventually decided that Travers, only being a second year, probably couldn\'t cast any of those curses. Harry also just had a gut feeling this was something different, so that was what he went with after a long moment of apprehension.

Two things fell from the package: a letter and a flowing, silvery something.

Harry opened the letter first.

*Your father left this in my possession when he died. It is time it was returned to you.*

*Use it well.*

*A very merry Christmas to you.*

Perplexed by the lack of a signature, Harry next picked up the flowing, silvery something; which actually turned out to be a cloak...

A cloak that made his hand vanish when it passed underneath its flowing fabric.

Suddenly, Harry was anything but fatigued.

***December 26, 1991***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***11:47 PM***

After the shock of owning a cloak that made one invisible had marginally worn off the previous night, Harry had used it to explore the castle for some time before he had run into Mrs. Norris. That encounter had raised very interesting questions: did the cloak work on cats or ghosts? He had already been sure it worked on people, but this would be an inherent weakness if it existed.

Thus, Harry had found himself in the library, scouring the shelves for any mention of anything like his cloak.

He had spent most of that night and the next day in the library, and it was where he had returned to after finishing up dinner in the Great Hall on this evening. After searching for several more hours, a possibility started nagging at Harry; one that subconsciously made his eyes dart every so often in the direction of the dark, shadowy portion of the library.

By the time midnight was approaching, he had given in and, with a deep, centring breath, made sure the cloak was fastened tightly around him before stepping into the Restricted Section.

Nothing happened, which was both a great relief as well as very anticlimactic. Once there, Harry searched for about thirty minutes before everything had gone pear-shaped.

He had opened an ancient, leather-bound tome which had omitted the most horrible and ghastly screaming sound imaginable. It was so bad that it made Harry drop the book and reflexively bolt from the room, knowing only that he wanted to get as far away from the Restricted Section as possible.

After running for what felt like ages and thoroughly losing track of where he was, Harry exhaustedly slunk into what he thought was a disused, abandoned classroom to allow himself time to catch his breath.

His assumption about the room was only half-correct.

It was, for all intents and purposes, an abandoned classroom, but it was perhaps not as out of use as Harry might have expected.

Leaning against one of the walls was an ornate-looking mirror that was about two full feet taller than Harry.

Something about it drew him in. Perhaps it was how rich and immaculate it appeared, but he didn\'t think that was it. It gave off an odd feeling that was hard to explain. Harry just... knew he had to look into that mirror.

What he saw confused him greatly.

He didn\'t see the room around him, nor did he even see a reflection.

In the mirror was nothing but vague, shadowy things that he couldn\'t entirely make out. They were so indiscernible that he couldn\'t decide whether they were people, objects, or something different altogether.

Yet he couldn\'t look away.

For reasons Harry Potter couldn\'t quite explain, he just couldn\'t look away.

And he didn\'t... for eight long hours.

***December 28, 1991***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***10:13 PM***

Harry had been so entranced by the odd mirror that he had returned the next night and simply spent hours staring into the shadowy shapes within. That next morning, Cassius had questioned him. He had asked why he had woken up so much later these last two days and why he looked as though he had barely slept.

The answer to both of those questions was simple.

Harry had spent both nights staring into the mirror until the sun had begun to rise, at which point he would hastily retreat to his dormitory, catch a few hours of sleep, and begin his day anew.

He hadn\'t told Cassius this, but the boy was no fool. He knew Harry was doing something and he had advised him not to do it that next night.

But Harry hadn\'t listened, which was how he found himself alone in the mirror room once more. He threw off his cloak and made a hasty beeline for the mirror.

\"So, back again, Harry?\"

He froze halfway there, feeling as though his insides had turned to ice. Apparently, he was not as alone as he had previously believed.

Sitting leisurely atop one of the desks, his hands folded serenely in his lap and a pensive expression upon his old, withered face, was Albus Dumbledore.

\"I... didn\'t see you there, sir.\"

\"Strange how shortsighted being invisible can make you.\"

Harry was relieved the man was smiling. It was actually the only thing that gave him the confidence to ask his next question.

\"Did you... know I would be here?\"

\"I certainly suspected you would be.\"

\"Sir, were you... here for all the time I\'ve spent looking into the mirror?\"

\"Only last night, I\'m afraid. Whether or not that is all the time you have spent in this room, I am unsure.\"

\"But I-I checked the room last night.\"

Dumbledore\'s eyes twinkled in an odd sort of way. \"If you will forgive my lack of modesty for a moment, I do not need a cloak to become invisible.\"

Ah, that would certainly do it.

\"So,\" said Dumbledore, sliding off the desk and walking casually towards both Harry and the mirror. \"You, like many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\"

Harry looked at the mirror once more. Not into it, but actually *at* it. Doing so was something he hadn\'t done since that first night and only now did he see the writing written upon it. At first glance, it appeared to be written in a foreign language. Upon closer inspection, he realized it was just English. Jumbled English, but English nonetheless.

*Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.*

\"I... guess so.\"

\"I expect that by now, you have deduced what it is the mirror shows you?\"

\"I... not exactly, sir.\"

Dumbledore studied him very closely. \"If it is not too presumptuous of me to ask, what is it that you see when you look into the Mirror of Erised?\"

Harry considered whether or not to answer. If the greatest wizard alive was asking the question, the answer was probably significant. Everything he had learned over the past few months while in Slytherin screamed that he shouldn\'t answer, but his natural curiosity said otherwise. Harry wanted to understand what it was about the mirror that was so compelling, and this seemed like his best chance to do just that.

\"I... don\'t see much of anything.\" When Dumbledore just waited patiently for Harry to elaborate, he acquiesced. \"I see a bunch of shadows. I can\'t even tell if they\'re people, things, or something else. They\'re just... there.\"

There was a long moment of silence during which Dumbledore stroked his beard, suddenly looking as though the lateness of the hour had caught up with him all at once.

\"Curious,\" he muttered, reminding Harry painfully of Mr. Olivander back in Diagon Alley. \"How very curious.\"

With an intense feeling of déjà vu, Harry decided to take the bait. \"What\'s curious, sir?\"

\"In all the time I have spent studying the Mirror of Erised --- and between the two of us, that has been occupying much of my time of late --- I have never once heard of the mirror showing anyone something similar to what you seem to be experiencing.\"

\"So... what is it that it\'s supposed to show you?\"

Dumbledore thought for a moment. \"Let me explain. If the happiest man on Earth looked into the mirror, he would be able to use it just as any other man would use an ordinary mirror. That is to say, he would see himself exactly as he is.\"

Harry thought about that, running a hand absentmindedly through his hair. \"It... shows you what you most want to see?\" That somehow didn\'t sound quite right, but it made some sense until Harry thought of it on a personal level. He knew of all the things he wanted to see, shadows weren\'t extraordinarily high on that list.

\"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore heavily. \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.\"

\"Isn\'t that the same thing, sir? And... how does that explain what I see?\"

\"Both excellent questions. I believe the former can actually be best explained by answering the latter. How it explains what you see, Harry, is best articulated by asking you to think upon the differences between your mind and your heart.

\"Your mind often thinks it knows what it wants above all things, but it is so rarely correct. I am sure you --- in your youthful naivety and exuberance --- think you desire a great many things. Alas, your heart knows best. It knows that when everything is boiled down, there is no one thing you have decided matters more than anything else. In the simplest possible terms, your mind is the manifestation of your consciousness, whilst your heart is often a reflection of all that is subconscious.\"

Harry nodded along slowly. The bit about him somehow sounded dark and depressing, but he couldn\'t dispute its accuracy. When he really thought about it, there wasn\'t one thing he wanted above all else.

\"This mirror will give us neither knowledge nor truth, Harry. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. The mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, and I ask you not to go looking for it. If you ever do come across it again, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live. Remember that. Now, how about you put on that admirable cloak of yours once more and get off to bed.\"

Harry got about halfway to his cloak when an odd question struck him. \"Professor Dumbledore... can I ask you something?\"

Dumbledore smiled once more. \"Obviously, you have just done so, but you may ask me one more thing.\"

\"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\"

There was a beat of silence before Dumbledore answered in a very measured and modulated tone. \"I see myself, many years ago, mending a great many things that I so wish were repairable.\" His serious demeanour washed away all at once. \"Now, I think it\'s time for bed.\"

Harry nodded and left the room, thinking on a great many things as he did so, once more back under his new invisibility cloak.

***December 29, 1991***

***A Tower Overlooking a Lake***

***8:14 AM***

On this fateful morning, the water was turbulent and churning, rising from its prison and slamming hard against the rock faces of any nearby mass of land. The sky was grey and overcast and the light breeze tore across the water\'s surface, seeming to laugh softly at the water\'s futile struggle to break free from its confines.

Surrounded by a great many mountain peaks sat a high, imposing tower. One that was much too tall and much too protected to ever be taken down by a storm, no matter how intense it might be.

From the top-most window of this imposing fortress, one would be able to see the sky and the lake just fine.

But the figure inside the tower\'s highest room saw none of this.

His emaciated body broke free from its fit of twitching and shot up to a sitting position with exuberance one might expect from a man nearly a century his junior. He was skeletally thin and his wrinkled, leathery skin was pulled tight across his perpetually aching bones.

Well, perhaps not perpetually because for the first time in years, the figure felt no ache.

Nor did he feel old, nor bored --- two sensations which had dominated his psyche for many years.

The man may not have seen the world outside through his then closed eyelids, but what he did see, to him, was far more beautiful than any bit of scenery that had ever existed.

The man\'s bluish-silver eyes --- which still shone with just as much intellect as ever --- were dancing with a malicious light not seen within them for decades as the one-time dark lord uttered, in reference to all he had just seen, the first word he had spoken in an age.

\"Hervorragend.\"

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***7:07 PM***

The rest of Harry\'s winter break had passed much more routinely after his conversation with Dumbledore standing before the Mirror of Erised. True to his word, he hadn\'t gone looking for the entrancing artifact again, though a small part of him did wonder where the mirror was now. For that matter, a small part of him wondered why the mirror had been at Hogwarts in the first place. It seemed like an odd thing to just be lying around a school, but perhaps there was something Harry was missing.

He and Cassius had wanted to go flying again, but the late December and early January weather of the Scottish highlands had other ideas. There hadn\'t been much snow falling in the past week or so, but the air had been frigid and the strong winds had been as bitingly cold as they had been persistent. The two of them had tried once and ended up retreating back into the castle within minutes. Cassius had shown Harry the Warming Charm, but it was simply no match for the brutality wrought upon them by the vengeful forces of nature.

Harry spent much of his time waiting for his friends\' return either in the library, keeping himself entertained with Cassius, or exploring the castle. He had gotten a lot of the latter done lately, largely aided by his invisibility cloak. He still hadn\'t told Cassius about it, nor did he plan to. He had considered it but decided against the idea. Whether he would tell Draco, Pansy, Theodore, Crabbe, and Goyle... that was more complicated.

He hadn\'t quite decided by the time they poured back into the common room alongside the rest of the returning Slytherin students.

\"Harry!\" Pansy squealed upon entering the room, rushing over and chattering at him at a million miles an hour. Harry\'s eyes nearly glazed over trying to keep up, but Draco saved him a minute or so later.

\"Let him breathe, Pansy. Merlin only knows how strange it must feel going from speaking with only Cassius to speaking with you.\"

\"And what exactly is that supposed to mean?\"

\"Just that Cassius is calm and quiet. You\'re a lot of things, but those are not two of them.\"

Pansy shoved Draco hard in the chest. \"Prat.\" She turned back towards Harry. \"How was your holiday?\"

\"It was good. A bit slow, but not in a bad way.\"

\"Any interesting gifts?\"

This was the moment his mind had been contemplating over for so long.

He had of course gotten a number of interesting things. Some of the books --- the more questionable ones, in particular --- had been unexpected. There had been the formal letter of introduction sent by Lord Black --- one Harry had very carefully responded to that next day --- as well as the golden watch from Lucius. He had taken Cassius\'s advice and looked into that. The only thing he could find in his book of etiquette was that watches were a traditional wizarding gift. Some lords passed them down to their heir upon their arrival at Hogwarts, while unrelated parties often distributed them for a wizard\'s seventeenth birthday. Since neither of those things seemed right, Harry was reasonably sure he was missing something.

And then, of course, there was the invisibility cloak.

Harry liked Cassius, but he didn\'t trust him nearly as much as this group of friends.

Even in saying that, he wasn\'t quite sure he trusted them enough to let them in on that little secret. The cloak was his trump card. It was his most treasured artifact and by far the most mystical thing he had thus far seen in this wonderful world of magic.

He wasn\'t quite sure he trusted *anybody* enough.

Then again, maybe they could help him put together the puzzle that had been troubling him for some time.

He had eventually found a book in the library that spoke a bit on invisibility cloaks. They were extremely rare things, so the information on them was very scarce. The most known thing about them was that they were often largely composed of demiguise hair.

That wasn\'t what had interested Harry the most.

The thing that piqued his interest above all others was the passage about how invisibility cloaks rarely lasted for longer than a few years.

That did not add up.

If whoever had sent the cloak was to be believed, then it had been his father\'s. He wasn\'t sure for how long before his death the man had owned it, but that meant it was more than ten years old. According to the admittedly limited amount of information at Harry\'s disposal, that should have been impossible.

Yet here it was.

Part of him wanted to ask Draco, Theodore, Pansy, or perhaps even Diana about this oddity.

But a larger part of him thought it was safer to keep at least one secret close to his chest.

He trusted these people --- trusted them more than anyone he had ever met in all of his life --- but he didn\'t trust them unconditionally.

The way he had been raised didn\'t lend itself well towards unconditional trust.

It wasn\'t that he didn\'t believe what they were telling him or that he thought they were lying. He trusted them in that regard.

What Harry worried about above all other things was that eventually, they would abandon him or turn their back on him. Just like his supposed family had done in the muggle world. Just like every friend he had made at school quickly did once Dudley had imposed his will upon them.

Harry couldn\'t shake the feeling that one day, he would be left alone once more.

From that paranoia stemmed a certain instinct to preserve oneself.

It was this instinct which led to Harry deciding not to tell his friends about the invisibility cloak.

***January 10, 1992***

***The Dungeons***

***9:34 PM***

Whilst at home over the holiday break, Theodore had apparently taken an interest in duelling. That led to Harry, Theodore, Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle mock duelling that first Friday night back at Hogwarts.

Draco had easily trounced Crabbe and Goyle. Not that such a thing was an accomplishment worth writing home about. Harry liked both of them; they were quiet but loyal and not quite as dim as everyone thought. Like them or not though, Harry could admit that saying Draco had trounced the pair was like saying your favourite Quidditch team had beaten the Chudley Cannons. It had probably happened, but it really didn\'t mean anything in the grand scheme of things.

Draco and Theodore\'s duels had been relatively competitive, but Theodore had the clear edge and Draco hadn\'t managed to beat him even once. Harry and Theodore had by far the most interesting rounds of duelling, but it was really a similar situation to when Theodore had duelled Draco, just in reverse. Whilst he didn\'t get embarrassed, Theodore never managed to win. He actually knew a number of spells Harry didn\'t, but Harry was just miles better at the spells he did know and Theodore\'s Aegis Vocar shield didn\'t hold up against spells like the Full-Body-Bind.

Harry felt exuberant after the duels. They had pumped life through his veins like blood, a feeling he had never experienced in this way before. Flying brought on a somewhat similar sensation, but it was nothing like this. This was something completely of its own nature and it was something Harry greatly enjoyed.

Though as they re-entered the common room to join back up with Pansy, Harry couldn\'t help but notice how Theodore seemed uncharacteristically quiet.

***February 2, 1992***

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***8:30 PM***

The night before February\'s first week of classes were to begin, all of the Slytherin first years were gathered around the fire in the centre of the common room. They had all been summoned by the prefects, all six of whom were sitting alongside them. Harry could see that Gemma Fawley --- the Head Girl and seventh-year prefect --- seemed to be the ringleader.

\"That\'s all of you?\" asked Marcus Flint, a sixth-year prefect and the captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team.

All of the first years nodded and the prefects all looked towards Gemma, who spoke next.

\"Exams take place every June at Hogwarts, as you all know. Academic performances play a large part in winning the House Cup, and those exams will make up the bulk of at least your practical marks in each subject.\" She looked intently at each of them in turn. \"Slytherin has won the House Cup for the past six years. It\'s not a trend we want to break, least of all me whilst I\'m Head Girl.

\"We know that as first years, taking exams can be stressful and a bit overwhelming. It\'s not something you will have done before, so we want to make sure you all succeed to the best of your abilities. That\'s why you\'re here. We\'ve gotten all of your grades from Professor Snape and looked them over. The idea is that each of you will have a student between fifth and seventh year to help tutor you and guide you through the process. Almost all of you will be tutored by sixth years, since fifth and seventh years have major exams of their own to worry about. There are a few exceptions though.

\"Obviously, you won\'t all be paired with a prefect, since there\'s more of you than there is us, but we\'ve gone through your grades and decided who to pair each of you with. You will meet with your partner at least once a week. It will be on a fixed day that the two of you can discuss. If you think you need more help, ask. More meetings can be arranged, but you\'re expected to meet at least once per week. Now, the pairings.\"

Draco was paired with Marcus Flint, which the younger boy was immensely smug about. Flint had quite the reputation among the younger years and even plenty of upper years. He was a demon of a chaser and a brutal captain. He wasn\'t an academic genius, but Harry had heard he did well at the practical side of magic. Defence Against the Dark Arts was his preferred area of study, but beyond all else, the hulking boy just had an intimidating aura about him.

Not that Draco cared all that much about that.

Harry knew all too well Draco was thrilled to be paired with Flint because, at least in his friend\'s mind, this was Draco\'s in with the Quidditch team next year.

Harry was the last of his friends to be paired up, and he couldn\'t help but be surprised by the identity of his partner.

\"Lastly,\" said Fawley, \"Potter, you\'re with me.\"

Harry had not expected that.

He had assumed she would use her authority as Head Girl to get out of the assignment. Especially with her N.E.W.T.s on the horizon. That seemed by far the more Slytherin thing to do and Harry couldn\'t see any valid reason why she hadn\'t done it.

Not that he was complaining.

She would probably be a great help, not just in preparing for the exams, but hopefully in learning some extra-curricular material. He wondered whether she would be averse to answering questions not directly related to the exams. He had put a considerable amount of work into magical theory since his lecture from Flitwick, and having somebody on standby at least once a week to answer his questions and help further his musings would be invaluable.

He supposed he would just need to wait and see how it all played out.

***February 14, 1992***

***The Dungeons***

***6:36 PM***

Harry and the others had awoken the morning of Valentine\'s Day to a completely different atmosphere than they were accustomed to. Many of the older students seemed quite touchy with one another. Harry personally had not needed to see several older boys chasing kisses with their girlfriends in the common room that morning. It made him more uncomfortable than it perhaps should have, but at least all the others in his group --- sans Pansy --- seemed to agree with him.

It didn\'t stop there, either.

There were two suits of armour standing guard outside the Great Hall that morning, both of them colourfully themed for the holiday. Their armour had been turned a lurid pink and they were armed with bows and arrows as opposed to swords and shields. The walls inside the Great Hall seemed also to temporarily have been painted red.

\"No great mystery who\'s done all this,\" Theodore muttered, glaring in the direction of the staff table.

In his throne-like chair sat Dumbledore, wearing robes of a vibrant pink that would put the armour outside the hall to shame. The old man\'s eyes were twinkling like mad and he also wore a smug smile that practically screamed of how proud of himself he really was.

\"Old codger\'s losing it a little bit more every day,\" murmured Draco, glaring up towards the Hogwarts Headmaster as though he had done him a great personal disservice.

None of that was the most awkward part of the morning.

The most awkward part of the morning had been when dozens of owls had flown into the hall and down towards the Slytherin table, depositing a mountain of post in front of Harry.

This hadn\'t been the first time a similar event had taken place.

He had been informed by Professor Snape that he had been the target of copious amounts of post on Samhain. The professors had anticipated this and decided to subvert Harry\'s post that day since they had thought it might have been a touch tasteless. Snape had told him the post was his to collect at any time, but Harry had never been inclined to do so. The last thing he needed was a bunch of people he had never met telling him how sorry they were about his parents just because he was famous. Most of them probably had never even met his mother or his father and they were likely just writing in hopes of getting a response from the wizarding world\'s magical celebrity.

He had gotten some mail on Yule as well, but it hadn\'t been a terribly large pile. He had wondered if the teachers had chosen to have the bulk of it subverted as well.

If they had, they had clearly forgotten that Valentine\'s Day existed. Or, perhaps, they just hadn\'t considered how it might affect the most famous student to ever go through Hogwarts.

To his ever-lasting embarrassment and his friends\' sadistic pleasure, it seemed as though every girl under the age of ten --- and some much older --- in the country had sent Harry well wishes. Some of them were more... personal than others. By the end of the meal, he was flushing so red he would have put Ron Weasley\'s hair to shame and he was all too eager to get out of the hall when their classes necessitated it.

The group of first-year Slytherins were presently walking back up to the Great Hall, this time for dinner, and Harry was receiving no small ribbing for the morning\'s events.

\"I can\'t believe that girl from Liverpool sent you her---\"

\"Don\'t!\" moaned Harry, burying his head in his hands as his friends laughed uproariously.

Until the fire spell sailed towards them.

Harry, head still in hands, felt a great force he would later learn to be Goyle shove him out of the way. The boy howled in pain right after. He had been struck full in the face by a spell that made his skin break out in horrible boils and his cries of protestation could be heard throughout the dungeons.

Harry felt numb. He was no stranger to having minor jinxes fired at him. Some of the brasher Gryffindors had been doing it for some time and some of the harsher blood supremacists within Slytherin had taken their own potshots on occasion.

This time was different.

This was a legitimate curse fired off in the hall with no regard for those around him.

Harry reacted instinctively.

Years of being bullied by Dudley and his brutish gang had trained a respectably fast reaction time into Harry and on this occasion, he was quick on the draw.

Still stumbling from Goyle shoving him out of the way, Harry threw himself to the floor, rolled, and got back to his feet, wand now in hand.

He recognized their assailants right away and though he was nervous, he knew it could have been much worse.

It was Travers and three of his friends, all of whom were second years.

Harry and Travers struck at the same time, just as Draco and Theodore engaged two of his friends and Crabbe charged forward towards the other.

Travers\'s spell missed, but Harry\'s didn\'t. Travers did manage a hasty Aegis Vocar, but the Full-Body-Bind fired from the end of Harry\'s wand tore straight through it and Travers fell face-first onto the hard stone floor of the dungeons.

Theodore had managed to best his opponent as well. Draco\'s duel was ongoing and Crabbe had somehow ended up on top of the boy he had charged, now pummeling him with furious blows that had the boy curling in on himself. Harry and Theodore both took aim at Draco\'s opponent and the boy fell quickly.

\"What, exactly, has happened here?\"

Harry felt his blood run cold at the sound of Snape\'s cool voice. The professor had never liked him. If he had seen him curse Travers...

\"We were attacked, sir!\" Harry was actually taken aback by how convincing Pansy sounded. She hadn\'t duelled at all, but she sounded for all the world as if her mother had just been murdered in cold blood. \"They just started firing spells. I-I panicked, but Harry, Draco, and the others didn\'t.\"

\"Is this true?\" Snape asked one of the fallen boys, whose face was covered by his now overgrown hair and whose legs were stuck together.

The boy could do nothing more than nod with great trepidation.

\"Off with you,\" Snape told Harry and his friends. \"I will... deal with this from here.\"

None of them protested. It was the first time any in their group had truly seen their Head of House angered and it was not a sight they cared to see again.

Harry, in particular, would have been far more shaken had his mind not been firmly fixated on what had just happened.

The bad news was that now, he might have just made himself some enemies. The good news was that he had not only been able to best a second year, but he had put the prat that was Damian Travers in his place.

Whether the shocking amount of savage pleasure he felt at such a thing was worth it or not, only time would tell.

***February 22, 1992***

***The Grounds of Hogwarts***

***10:13 AM***

Ron was practically glowing by the time his teammates finally allowed him some breathing room.

They had played a match against Hufflepuff that morning and Ron had managed to outfly their seeker and steal the snitch. It hadn\'t been a quick catch, nor had it been easy, but he had done it. There had been no drama with his sleeve this time; it had just been a straightforward race to the snitch, with Ron outmanoeuvring his counterpart and snatching it, signalling an end to the game and setting Gryffindor up as the favourites to win the Quidditch Cup for the first time in over five years.

His teammates had mobbed him and even in the dressing room after the initial, on-pitch festivities, there had been a considerable amount of celebrating. Ron knew too from the aftermath of the last match that there would be a long-running party in the common room that night.

He was actually looking forward to it, but his attention was currently in other places.

One specific place, actually.

That place was the forbidden forest, which he now glided through on his broom, doing his best to follow the hooded figure making its way deeper and deeper into the forest\'s depths.

Ron knew the hooded figure to be Snape, for he had seen him making off towards the vast expanse of forestry before he had pulled his hood up to obscure his sallow face and long, black hair.

He had not yet pulled up his hood when Ron saw him begin making his way towards the forest.

Ron may not have had adequate justification for following, but he was a curious, eleven-year-old boy who despised the bat and considered him to be a greasy old wankstain. He had also seen his mangled leg days after the incident on Halloween, so seeing him sneak off into the forest was sounding alarm bells in his mind.

So he had followed him, gliding stealthily through the canopy on the Nimbus 2000 the school had purchased for him all those months ago. He was presently sitting on a high-up tree branch, veiled mostly by leaves.

He wasn\'t entirely sure what he had expected to see, but the situation\'s reality certainly was not what he had been prepared for.

Snape walked out into a clearing into which a certain degree of light was allowed to stream via the canopy of leaves high above being thinner than the path that had led there. Snape had been in said clearing for but a second before another figure shimmered into existence, causing Ron to gasp. Neither man seemed to hear him, so he refocused, now even more determined to stay out of sight and not make a sound

\"Ah, yes, Severus. Thank you for meeting me in such short order. I know the notice given was less than ideal.\" Snape just nodded curtly at Dumbledore. \"I trust you have continued to keep tabs on our mutual interest?\"

\"Naturally.\"

\"Have any of your findings been of import?\"

\"Your suspicions about the cerberus were correct. It is the primary obstacle in his way and it is a puzzle piece he has not yet solved.\"

\"Very good. Let us hope that mystery continues to baffle him for some time.\"

\"You think it only a matter of time until a solution is found?\"

\"I do.\"

\"May I ask why? He is competent, but I would not have pegged him as such a threat.\"

\"Oh, I am far from certain. I suspect a great deal, but in truth, I know very little.\" Ron could see even from his vantage point that Dumbledore smiled after saying that. \"Well, I suppose I do know a great many things, but none of them directly correlate here, I\'m afraid.\"

\"Shame,\" Snape said dryly, lip curled up in distaste.

\"Indeed. Do you have anything else for me?\" Snape shook his head curtly. \"Very well. While we are here, is there anything of note regarding our... other interest?\"

\"You mean Potter?\"

\"Indeed.\"

\"Not of interest to you. Not much has changed, though the opinions of some in the house towards him are souring.\"

Dumbledore hummed as Ron\'s brain began to work at top speed, trying to figure out what all of this meant. \"Do keep me abreast of such things. I think his Slytherin sorting will be quite the interesting tale to watch unfold.\" Snape nodded jerkily. \"Well, we will meet again in one month\'s time and see if anything of significance has changed. I do thank you for your assistance, Severus. It has been and continues to be invaluable.\"

Dumbledore vanished into thin air, leaving a pensive-looking Snape and a very confused Ron behind him.

Ron had gleaned little of the meeting\'s true intent, but he did know one thing.

Somebody was after whatever lay hidden under that trapdoor protected by the massive, three-headed dog. Somebody who was trying to get past it.

Perhaps it was time to set Hermione down the path of cerberus research. It seemed like a project she would be thoroughly interested in.

\'Well,\' Ron thought with an exasperated half-smile, quietly sliding back onto his broomstick as he made to depart the clearing. \'There aren\'t many projects that girl wouldn\'t be interested in.\'

***March 20, 1992***

***The Dungeons***

***9:08 PM***

Harry had firmly settled into his Hogwarts routine by this point of the school year. He would wake up in the mornings and explore the castle until breakfast, at which point he would join his friends in the Great Hall. Classes would come next --- unless, of course, it was a weekend --- which would take up most of the day. When both classes and dinner had concluded, Harry would usually spend the nights studying, either in the library or by the fire. He was often in the company of his friends, but he frequently paid only half attention to the conversation.

He had taken to using the fast-approaching exams as an excuse to bury his face in books. Really, the truth of the matter was that since diving much further into magical theory, he had just become far more interested in learning it. He was fairly sure at least Theodore and Pansy saw through this farce, but neither of them had thus far called him out on it.

The only nights of the week during which his plan slightly altered were Thursdays and Fridays. Thursdays were spent at a table warded for privacy in the library with Gemma. It had been the day of the week that worked best for her and Harry had been agreeable to just about any time. She did help him study the theoretical portions of some of the courses, but it wasn\'t what made Harry look forward to those sessions.

He had taken by now to reading second-year material in Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, and Charms. He hadn\'t run into any significant setbacks yet, but it was still nice having Gemma to help him with the material. She was surprisingly willing and it was really quite helpful. His professors were busy helping his own yearmates with their actual coursework for Harry to realistically ask them second-year questions. He could have asked Snape, since the man was his Head of House, but the Potions Master still usually pretended Harry didn\'t exist. That was preferable to outright hostility, even if Harry was still more than a little bit bitter. He didn\'t want to risk having a man with so much power over him become openly antagonistic, so he had held his tongue.

Tonight had been another one of his meetings with Gemma and he was feeling pretty good about the whole thing.

\"Oi, Potter!\"

Until an older-sounding voice called out to him and he froze, turning to face the source of the sound.

The boy was tall and lean --- obviously an upper year --- and he looked vaguely familiar. Harry couldn\'t quite place why, for he was sure he had never actually met this boy before.

\"Yes?\"

\"I heard you gave my brother some trouble a while back.\"

Harry\'s face scrunched up as he tried to think what the boy could be talking about. Then, it clicked. The reason this boy looked familiar was because, in many ways, he greatly resembled an older-looking version of Damian Travers; the boy who had antagonized Harry back in December and then jumped him and his friends on the way to the dungeons back in February.

\"He started it,\" argued Harry. \"He fired the first spell. I just defended myself. Besides,\" he continued when he saw that the boy and his two friends whom Harry didn\'t recognize were not looking at all appeased. \"That was like... two months ago now.\"

\"And I would have dealt with it back then had he not waited to tell me. I could tell something was bothering him and it took me ages to get it out of him.\" The boy stepped closer to Harry in a menacing sort of manner. \"I don\'t appreciate people hurting my family, Potter. I\'ve left you alone so far --- even though I think your sorting is disgraceful. Don\'t test my patience.\"

Harry logically knew that he should be terrified, but he wasn\'t.

Instead, he was furious.

He was being blamed for something he hadn\'t done. It really had been Travers who had both started and escalated the whole thing. Harry had just been on the defensive, and now he was being accused of something that hadn\'t been his fault.

There were very few things that annoyed him more than that.

Years of having that unfortunate thing repeatedly happen while under the Dursleys\' rule had grated on Harry. Every time it happened now, it was like a torrent of fire would rise up in his chest, sticking out a fiery tongue and licking at his innards like a snake trying to find a well-hidden exit.

His hands clenched into fists as he tried very hard to resist the urge to go for his wand. He knew he would be hopelessly outmatched by any of these three boys, let alone the trio working together.

But the feeling was just so intense and he found the urge so powerful.

One of the nearby torch brackets exploded, spewing flames straight towards the elder Travers, whose eyes widened as he dove to the side. Harry just stood there wide-eyed, transfixed, and confused by the event that had just occurred.

Had he made that happen?

A wall of force slammed into his chest before he could come to a logical conclusion and he suddenly felt weightless as he soared backwards, slamming hard into the stone floor a moment later. The three boys were marching towards him now. Judging by the looks of hatred and fury on their faces, they at least clearly thought he had somehow caused whatever had just happened.

He tried to get up, but couldn\'t. It wasn\'t that he was in pain so much as that his body just wouldn\'t respond. He couldn\'t properly breathe and without the necessary oxygen, his brain just didn\'t seem to be sending and receiving signals the same way. It was like a satellite responsible for providing muggles with television, but one that was covered in debris of some kind. It still technically worked, but it was choppy and operating at a lower rate of success than usual.

Harry recognized this feeling. He had experienced it enough in his youth, usually during rounds of \'Harry hunting\' that hadn\'t ended favourably for him.

The wind had been forcefully knocked out of him.

\"Protego!\"

A translucent barrier of magic shimmered into being between Harry and his older assailants before they could accost him any further.

\"Travers, what the hell do you think you\'re doing?\"

Harry recognized the voice now. He had heard it not ten minutes ago --- it was Gemma Fawley.

\"This doesn\'t concern you, Fawley.\" snapped back Travers.

\"I\'m the Head Girl and you and your group of thugs are attacking a defenceless first year. I think this is the exact sort of thing that concerns me.\"

\"Defenceless,\" said one of the other boys. \"He made one of the torches explode and spray us with fire and he didn\'t even have his wand!\"

\"Don\'t be ridiculous, Rowle,\" said Fawley. \"Wandless magic of that sort isn\'t possible for any first year. I don\'t know what happened, but that wasn\'t it. Now, move along or this will be taken to Snape.\"

Grumbling and cursing all the way, Travers and his group of thugs, as Gemma had called them, made their reluctant retreat.

\"Are you all right?\" the girl asked, offering her hand and helping the rather small first year to his feet without much trouble.

\"Fine,\" muttered Harry, casting a contemptuous glare in the direction the three older boys had made off in. \"I wasn\'t paying attention. I was surprised by the whole torch thing and then I just got blasted in the chest by something and was flying backwards.\" Harry frowned. \"What was that spell? It seemed really useful.\"

\"Probably either a Banishing Hex or a Knockback Jinx,\" said Gemma. \"The former is a fourth-year spell, so I doubt you would be capable of it just yet.\"

\"What about the other?\"

\"Mid-to-late second year depending on the professor.\"

\"Can you teach me?\"

Her lips twitched. \"Not tonight, but yes; I think teaching it to you should be easy enough. I\'m actually interested in seeing you cast magic instead of just talking about it.\"

\"Next Thursday?\"

She smiled. \"Next Thursday.\"

Despite all that had just happened, Harry smiled back, the anger and worry over the night\'s events temporarily wiped away, if only for a second.

They would be contemplated on in short order, but for now, he simply looked forward to learning a new trick.

***April 12, 1992***

***The Library***

***3:44 PM***

\"Well?\" asked Ron once Hermione had returned from scouring the section of the room they\'d seen Hagrid looking through just a minute or so earlier. \"What was he looking at?\"

So far, Hermione had been completely unsuccessful at finding any bits of information relating to a cerberus, but this was one thing she did not fail at.

She held up several books, all of them pertaining to a single topic.

Ron\'s brain blanked.

No\...

But Hagrid had been acting so suspicious and all of these books...

Surely not...

Surely not even Hagrid would be so daft as to raise a dragon in a wooden hut, for Merlin\'s sake!

**Author\'s Endnote:**

**The pace has picked up dramatically and we are nearing the end. Four more chapters left to go.**

**This will be a much longer AN than usual because I do want to respond to what has really been the only bit of criticism I\'ve gotten so far.**

**Largely, it seems to boil down to the fact that people just have an inherent dislike of Ron and therefore are not fond of him being painted in a favourable light. I make no apologies for how I will be writing Ron. I don\'t believe in needless bashing of characters as I think it is mindless, counterintuitive, and usually not at all reflective of human psychology.**

**However, I will address the concern that Ron is just canon Harry. I can see where that would be an assumption right now, but give it some time. Harry in *The Philosopher\'s Stone*** **was really just a cookie-cutter Gryffindor, so it isn\'t super hard to see how Ron ends up on a similar path here, since not much has canonically changed thus far. I have tried to vary it as much as I can --- by example, he has not navigated Quidditch with the same ease as Harry. Despite Ron coming from a wizarding background, he is canonically not as good at playing quidditch. Nor is he in this fic. This is why we see him making a much less graceful catch of the remembrall, plus a longer match with Hufflepuff in this chapter. This hasn\'t come up, but the only reason Ron has not panicked in Quidditch matches is because when you\'re eleven, you are much less prone to overthinking things as opposed to someone who is fifteen.**

**The last two chapters of this year make much more significant changes to canon that will begin sending Ron down his own path. Trust me, his flaws are still very much there; they just aren\'t the sorts of things that naturally manifest at the age of eleven.**

**I hope this has dissuaded some of the concern regarding his character. If you just want me to bash Ron because you dislike him, this just isn\'t the fic for you, which is fine.**

**For the record, I can\'t wait for the bang that ends this year off...**

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***4:46 PM***

It was the Friday before classes would resume after the Easter holiday break and Harry, along with most of his friends, was sitting around a table in the Slytherin common room. Theodore was playing chess against Pansy, whilst Crabbe and Goyle munched on some sweets and Harry read his book on intermediate magical theory.

Draco was out doing... something. Harry wasn\'t exactly sure what; his friend had been odd as of late.

He seemed to have developed a sort of fixation with Ron Weasley. Ever since Gryffindor\'s Quidditch win all the way back in February, Draco\'s disdain of the boy seemed to have reignited anew. His taunts had grown more frequent and he spoke more and more about Weasley in the company of his friends. The vitriol didn\'t quite match that which Draco had spouted after the first game between Gryffindor and Slytherin, but it was by far the worst Harry had heard since that match had taken place.

Harry had quietly cut in once when Draco\'s incessant criticism of Weasley\'s character had just become too much to bear.

It wasn\'t that Harry had any attachment to Weasley. He didn\'t know the boy, nor did he care about him one way or the other. He hadn\'t been among the bitter contingent of Gryffindors who had been subtly jinxing him in the hallway, but he hadn\'t stopped them either. Harry had seen him shooting a glare or two in the days immediately following the sorting, but they really hadn\'t interacted much beyond that.

He understood the concept of a blood traitor and he didn\'t completely disagree with the stance. The magical world was infinitely superior to the muggle one in every way Harry could conceive. It made no sense to him why anyone would choose to associate with the mundane world, but he didn\'t quite see why purebloods got all up in arms about it. Perhaps they thought these blood traitors were implicitly saying the muggle world was superior. Harry hadn\'t really interpreted it that way. The disregarding of customs was a tad disrespectful in his opinion, but it wasn\'t really something he thought worth holding centuries of prejudice over.

None of that really mattered to Harry. While he thought Hogwarts celebrating Halloween and Christmas instead of Samhain and Yule was a touch disrespectful, he couldn\'t really blame the Weasleys or other families for not following traditions to the letter.

He didn\'t care about Ron Weasley in the slightest. It was just that he didn\'t care at all about Draco\'s hatred for the boy.

The youngest member of the Malfoy family had been surprisingly quiet about his distaste of Weasley ever since, at least in the presence of Harry. His hateful streak hadn\'t stopped though. Recently, he had even cursed Neville Longbottom in the hallway. Though Harry knew Draco disliked Neville due to their families\' disagreements, he thought it had as much to do with Longbottom\'s association with Draco\'s red-headed rival. Draco had even been saying that Weasley was \'up to something.\' He didn\'t know what that \'something\' was, but he was insistent that he was going to find out and somehow use it against Weasley.

None of his friends had taken him seriously until that night, but that all changed when a frantic and breathless Draco Malfoy exploded into the common room, rushing over to his friends with a demented-looking smile.

\"What\'s got you so excited?\" asked Theodore, looking up from the chess game and unmistakably stalling for time to think.

Draco then immediately wiped all notions of chess from their minds. \"That oaf Hagrid is raising a dragon in his hut!\"

Harry felt a painful jolt in his stomach. \"A... dragon?\" he asked. Draco nodded eagerly. \"There aren\'t dragons in Britain, are there?\"

\"Not many,\" said Pansy, \"but they do exist. You wouldn\'t have heard about them in the muggle world. When muggles come across them... well, they usually don\'t live to tell the story.\"

\"And even if they did,\" said Theodore, \"they would be obliviated.\" Harry looked puzzled, so the boy elaborated. \"Obliviated is another word for taking away someone\'s memories of something. There\'s an entire squadron in the ministry that takes care of that. Usually, it has to do with making sure the muggles don\'t find out about us.\"

To Harry, that sounded like the most dangerous spell in the world. He knew exactly the damage not clearly remembering something could cause. His failure to remember exactly how his parents had died had been what forced him to live in ignorance for ten long years. Had it not been for Hagrid\'s intervention, he might have never learned the truth.

The potential for things like that to be artificially inflicted upon others through the wave of a wand... it made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up and his heartbeat quicken.

He did not like the sound of that spell, even if he could see it was necessary for maintaining the International Statute of Secrecy. If there was a way of defending oneself against it though, Harry was one day going to master it.

\"Owning them is illegal,\" Draco spat with vicious satisfaction. \"I\'ll get the oaf thrown out for this.\"

\"Why?\" All of Harry\'s friends looked towards him with various degrees of confusion evident upon their faces. \"Why do you want Hagrid gone? He hasn\'t done anything to you, has he?\"

\"Well... no,\" Draco spluttered, blushing.

\"It would be a right shock to Weasley though,\" Theodore said with a vicious grin. \"Bet he\'d love that, eh Draco?\"

Draco\'s malicious expression returned with vigour. \"Exactly. It\'s not about the oaf. I mean, it is illegal and he should really be charged for breaking the law, but I don\'t much care about him. It\'s about Weasley. He was there, you know? He and Granger. Probably Longbottom too, but I couldn\'t see through the curtains. If that idiot gets caught for raising a dragon, maybe he\'ll take those three twats down with him.\"

Harry felt very torn.

Draco was his best friend, but he did like Hagrid. They exchanged letters every couple of weeks and he was probably the only adult Harry had ever somewhat trusted. For Draco to casually talk about getting him arrested just to hurt Weasley hit Harry in a way that made him unsure of what to do next.

For now, he would remain quiet. It seemed best to let the situation evolve. After all, there was a very real possibility that Draco would be unable to follow through on his threats. If Harry stayed neutral and this prospect came to light, he could remain on the best of terms with both Draco and Hagrid without risking himself in the process.

Yes, neutrality really was best --- at least for now.

***Meanwhile, in the Gryffindor common room...***

\"He\'ll have to get rid of it,\" Hermione was saying. \"Now that Malfoy knows Hagrid is raising the dragon, there really is no way he can keep it.\"

Ron snorted. \"Yeah, because raising it in a wooden hut would have gone so well.\" He rolled his eyes in an exasperated manner. \"Honestly, I don\'t know what Hagrid was thinking. I doubt even Fred and George would think that was a good idea, and those two are lunatics.\"

\"Getting rid of it isn\'t going to be easy though,\" put in Neville. \"Not now that Malfoy knows. I doubt he\'ll just let it go. Some of his friends, too. Potter\'s one of the best in the year, and if Nott\'s anything like his father---\"

\"Well, it\'s not exactly like we\'re planning for them to find out, is it?\" Ron asked rhetorically. \"That\'d just be stupid. We\'ll convince Hagrid to get the dragon off the grounds and just make sure Malfoy and his group of gits never figure out what we\'re doing.\"

Neville glanced at Hermione, but she could do little more than shrug. \"It\'s probably the best idea we\'ll be able to come up with,\" she admitted. \"Obviously, we need to work out the details and make sure we\'re clever about the whole thing, but I don\'t really see any other option.\"

Reluctantly, the three of them got to work.

***April 30, 1992***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***8:46 PM***

\"That\'s really all we can cover for the first-year material,\" Gemma was telling Harry. \"You\'ll ace your wanded subjects with no issue. The theory-based classes will really just come down to how much you study. You know all of the material, it will just be about remembering all of it on the day.\"

\"Thanks, Gemma,\" said Harry. \"This has actually been really helpful.\" He hesitated. \"If we\'re done with the first-year material and you don\'t think we can do much more preparing for the exams, does that mean these sessions are over?\"

There was a note of hope in Harry\'s voice. Not for the sessions to be over, but for the prospect of their continuation. He had truly enjoyed them and had learned a great deal. His absolute highlight of these sessions had been when Gemma had taught him the Knockback Jinx. He had mastered it in no time, something that had impressed her greatly. He felt as though she could teach him a great many more things, so a part of him hoped this wasn\'t the end of these sessions.

Gemma frowned. \"It technically should be,\" she said slowly. \"I was meant to help you prepare for the exams and I\'ve done that.\" She paused, taking in the openly nervous expression her younger counterpart wore. \"I\'m not all that worried about my N.E.W.T.s, though. I know I\'ll get the necessary grades and this is only an hour a week anyway. I... could continue if you\'d like; there just really isn\'t any need.\"

Harry had a difficult time asking people for things. It was something that had been trained out of him by years of living with the Dursleys. It took a great deal of effort to overcome the impulse to stay quiet, but he managed it. He knew that if he did not speak up now, his request would never be met.

\"Whataboutteachingmethesecondyearstuff?\"

Gemma blinked. \"Come again?\"

Harry blushed. His question had come out rushed and garbled. He took a deep breath. \"What about teaching me some of the second-year stuff? Maybe even just some useful spells for duelling like the Knockback Jinx? I\'m really interested in Defence and that was really fun.\"

Gemma considered him for a moment. \"Okay,\" she agreed. \"I\'ll teach you, so long as you\'re willing to learn anything I ask of you without questioning it.\"

Grinning, Harry nodded, happy that they had come to an accord so easily.

***May 2, 1992***

***The Grounds of Hogwarts***

***8:13 PM***

Ron, Hermione, and Neville left Hagrid\'s hut that night with very mixed emotions.

On one hand, they had finally managed to convince their giant of a friend to transport the dragon off of the grounds.

Hagrid had always gotten on well with Ron ever since the boy had arrived at the castle back in September. The Gamekeeper had greatly enjoyed his brother Charlie and he had invited the Gryffindor trio into his hut for tea after Ron caught the snitch in Gryffindor\'s opening match of the season. After they had realized what he was raising, entered his hut, called him out on it, and *still* kept his secret, a deep bond of trust had been formed.

Ever since the egg had hatched and Draco Malfoy of all people had become aware of it, the trio had been doing their best to convince Hagrid the dragon needed to be moved. He had been more than a little bit resistant to the idea at first, but tonight, they had finally made him see reason.

Though they had come to several other revelations.

Apparently, the three-headed monstrosity in the third-floor corridor belonged to Hagrid. Hermione still hadn\'t been able to learn anything about cerberuses, but this one was also named Fluffy, of all things. The fact was one Hagrid had slipped when speaking of how the tale of his monstrosity had drawn the attention of a hooded man in a bar. A hooded man who then gave Hagrid a dragon\'s egg after a game of cards, but not before Hagrid had told him exactly how to get past his pet monster.

Ron, Hermione, and Neville were reasonably worried this man had nefarious goals in mind. They had been sure for months that the dog was in the castle for the sole purpose of protecting whatever lay below that trapdoor.

\"That ain\'t none o\' yer business,\" Hagrid had told them when they had inquired as to exactly what that thing was. \"Tha\'s between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.\" He had then frozen with the look of someone who had just had a bucket of ice-cold water dumped over their head, snapping them brutally out of whatever trance they had been in. \"I should not o\' told ya that,\'\" Hagrid had said. \"I should definitely not o\' told ya that.\"

But he had, and the trio had a new goal.

Or, at least they had.

It had taken only minutes for them to solve the question of exactly who Nicholas Flamel was. Not through any brilliance on any of their parts, but through a pure stroke of luck.

Neville had removed a Chocolate Frog from his pocket on the way back up to the castle. Its card had been one of Albus Dumbledore and there on its back was the name Nicholas Flamel.

\"He\'s in a book I have up at the castle,\" breathed Hermione, hardly being able to believe their good fortune. \"Come on, I\'ll get it when we\'re back in the common room.\"

Ron had the most peculiar feeling that whatever Nicholas Flamel was involved with, it was only going to make this whole situation all the more complicated.

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***8:13 PM***

\"So let me get this straight,\" said Theodore. \"Weasley was bit by the dragon and went to the hospital wing?\" Draco nodded eagerly. \"Then, he was stupid enough to take a letter from his brother with him? Or to leave it out on the table, depending on when he got it?\"

\"Yes,\" said Draco, pushing out his chest sounding extremely smug about the whole thing. \"But it\'s even worse. The letter basically explains exactly how they plan to sneak the dragon out of the castle. I\'m going to tell the professors and watch the idiots get caught. They\'ll be punished --- hopefully, the weasel too --- and the oaf will be gone.\"

Harry had thus far stayed quiet, but as Draco explained his plan, he came to the unfortunate conclusion that it would work.

Which meant neutrality was no longer an option.

He liked Draco and his friends immensely. He liked them more than Hagrid if truth was to be told, but he knew this wasn\'t right. Hagrid might have broken the law, but he shouldn\'t be used as some pawn to get at Weasley over something as childish as jealousy born from Quidditch success. It was stupid and Hagrid was one of the few people Harry liked. He had never thought about it before, but he supposed this proved to himself he would happily break the law for people whom he viewed in a favourable light.

That was, as it happened, a significant revelation, and it was one that he would need to think on later.

Harry pulled Draco aside some minutes later. \"What is it?\" the blond asked, still very much high on his preemptive victory.

\"Can I ask a favour?\"

Draco\'s eyebrows knit together. \"Of course.\"

\"Drop the whole business with the dragon, all right?\"

Draco\'s eyes narrowed. \"Why would you want me to do that, of all things?\"

\"Because Hagrid doesn\'t deserve to be thrown in prison.\"

\"Harry, he\'s breaking the law. He\'ll be tried just like anyone else who breaks the law.\"

\"I don\'t care about the law.\" And he realized it was true. Probably due to years of harsh rules imposed upon him by the Dursleys. It had given him an unorthodox outlook on things. Actions didn\'t matter to him so much as intentions. \"Hagrid\'s a good person. That\'s all that matters in the end, right?\"

\"I don\'t care about Hagrid,\" Draco said, the Gamekeeper\'s name spoken with obvious distaste.

\"Well, I do.\"

Draco frowned. \"Why on earth would you care about him?\"

\"He was the person who introduced me to the magical world, Draco. I know he isn\'t perfect and that he\'s... not what you would call put together. But... that first day, it means something to me. You know I lived with muggles and you know how much I hated them. Hagrid was the one who helped me get away. If not for him, I might not be here. That\'s important to me. And who really cares about Weasley? He\'s just some kid, at the end of the day. Is some fight in school really worth what you\'re going to put someone through?\"

Draco seemed to think about that very deeply. \"Fine,\" he said with a blank expression. \"I won\'t go through with my plan.\"

Harry had the oddest sense that Draco was lying. Something seemed to tingle within him, but he ignored it. Draco had never lied to him before, nor had he ever led Harry astray. The Slytherin youth couldn\'t imagine his best friend doing anything of the sort over something as important to him as this.

He smiled with relief, ignoring the odd feeling that persisted even now. \"Thanks, Draco. I appreciate it.\"

His friend\'s blank mask didn\'t change. \"Don\'t mention it, Harry.\"

***May 9, 1992***

***Hagrid\'s Hut***

***12:23 AM***

Rubeus Hagrid was dreaming.

In this dream, he imagined watching the dragon he had recently let go of soaring high in the sky, fully grown and at its majestic best. Fire spewed from the creature\'s mouth like forcefully propelled streams of molten lava as the beast let out roars that tore across the land. He also thought he heard a great banging sound, but that was most out-of-place for this dream.

He felt as though something was... stinging him, but he could not for the life of him understand why. It wasn\'t a sensation he had felt before in a dream and it was one that greatly confused him. The stinging eventually grew intense enough that, with a jolt, Hagrid woke from his deep slumber.

He awoke to the sight of a cluster of men in auror uniforms gathered around his bed, all of them with their wands levelled and hard, stony expressions upon their faces.

\"Wha... wha\'s goin\' on \'ere!?\"

\"Mr. Hagrid,\" boomed a deep, baritone voice belonging to a dark-skinned man wearing a badge that marked him as a Senior Auror who stepped forward. \"We are here to inform you that you are under arrest for the illegal breeding, ownership, and potential smuggling of a several-week-old Norwegian Ridgeback.\"

Hagrid\'s eyes bulged as the blood drained from his face and his skin lost all colour.

***About thirty minutes earlier\...***

The moon was bright on this night, nearing the end of its lunar cycle and shining mostly full in the dark, velvety sky. Its light shone and cast the massive, black outline of Hogwarts castle into sharp relief, making its shadowy form look both ominous and sinister.

Inside this castle, something ominous really was taking place. Something that was dangerous and not exactly legal, at the very least, and something that felt ominous to those carrying out the deed in question.

\"Time check,\" ordered Hermione in a hasty whisper.

\"Sixteen minutes to midnight,\" answered Neville in the same tone of voice.

\"Perfect,\" said Hermione. \"There won\'t be any prefects for the rest of the way. We\'re in the clear as long as none of the ghosts are waiting for us.\"

Sneaking through the castle at night and trying to get a crate containing a live dragon up to the astronomy tower was more than a little bit challenging. Ron --- still currently in the hospital and recovering from the dragon\'s bite --- had come up with a stroke of inspiration. It, along with an unreasonable amount of luck, was the only reason the two first-year Gryffindors had yet to be caught.

He had seen how his brother, Percy, had a schedule detailing at what time each of the prefects were to patrol each floor of the castle after curfew. The plan had been simple. Steal one of those schedules and plan their trek up to the astronomy tower around the patrol times. It wasn\'t a perfect course of action by any means, but seeing as they couldn\'t exactly become invisible, it was the best thing they had.

And thus far, it had worked, they had only a short distance left to traverse.

The two of them stepped out from their hiding place --- a small space behind one of the many suits of armour that was cast into dark shadow by the lowly-lit torches flickering in their brackets all along the corridor --- and made their way towards a tapestry across the way. Pushing it aside, they revealed a long staircase; one that led straight up to the astronomy tower.

They ascended carefully, hearts racing in their chests like hastily beaten drums as they did so.

They had made it.

No patrols were set to be atop the astronomy tower for the next number of hours. They had actually done it; they made it through the entire castle without being stopped!

The dry air of the night hit them as soon as they stepped back outside. The breeze seemed stronger now that they were so high above the ground which stretched out far beneath them. The two of them actually took the time to exchange victorious glances, both of them in total disbelief that their plan had actually worked.

\"And what exactly are the two of you doing at such an ungodly hour of the night?\"

The cold, silky drawling voice made both Gryffindors\' blood run cold.

From out of the darkness near the edge of the tower stepped the Hogwarts Potions Master, his eyes glinting ominously in the night as he loomed towards them; eyes that fell on the crate in their arms.

\"Oh dear,\" he said in barely more than a whisper. \"I do hope the rumours of what is in that crate turn out to be falsehoods. If they don\'t, I fear that a number of people are in a great deal of trouble.\"

***Back in the present, in the headmaster\'s office...***

Neville shakily finished retelling his side of the story, adding to what Draco Malfoy --- who sat in a third chair across from the Headmaster alongside him and Hermione --- had already stated. Draco was looking more annoyingly smug than Neville had ever seen him and Hermione had been quietly crying for the duration of the meeting.

Dumbledore sat back in his chair and sighed whilst Professors Snape and McGonagall --- both of whom stood nearby --- remained still and silent.

\"I hope the both of you, as well as Master Weasley, understand just how serious this transgression really is.\" Hermione\'s crying became deep sobs at that and Neville was looking anywhere but at the wizened man sitting across from him. \"I would have expected better from the both of you. You, in particular, Miss Granger. You are an immensely talented witch and I had hoped the events of October the 31st had taught you a very valuable lesson.\"

\"I-I\'m s-s-so sorry, H-H-Headmaster,\" sobbed Hermione. \"It\'s a-all my f-f-fault. I should never have d-done it and now I\'m g-going t-to be exp-p-pelled.\"

Her voice broke on the last word and she began shaking uncontrollably, sobbing heavier than ever and looking altogether like she was having a complete and total breakdown.

\"Miss Granger,\" said Dumbledore in a voice that was surprisingly soft and kind given the situation at hand. \"Please do cease the more extreme bits of your reaction. I can tell that you are most upset and this is indeed a very serious matter. I can, however, assure you that, on this night, you are not going to be expelled from this institution.\"

\"I\'m not?\" asked an awe-struck Hermione just as an incredulously furious Draco exclaimed \"WHAT?!\"

\"Do calm yourself, Master Malfoy,\" Dumbledore chided gently. \"I won\'t have such shouting at this time of the night.\" Draco snapped his mouth shut, though his glare did not waver. If Dumbledore noticed, he didn\'t show it, choosing instead to let his stare fall on Hermione and Neville once more. \"No, Miss Granger,\" he said, \"you are not being expelled tonight. Neither is Master Weasley, nor is Master Longbottom.\"

\"But... we broke the law.\" Neville stomped painfully on Hermione\'s foot in an attempt to get her to shut up. He was hardly going to complain about not being expelled; his gran might have actually killed him if that event had come to pass.

It was in Hermione\'s nature to speak on such things, though. It wasn\'t that she was arguing with Dumbledore and stating that she wanted to be expelled. It was that, according to the rules, she should have been. She was simply trying to understand why they weren\'t being followed to the letter.

\"You did,\" agreed Dumbledore. \"You broke both law and curfew tonight and under the rule of many men, you likely would not be permitted to continue studying here. I, however, have a habit of seeing the best in people and situations alike --- as my many critics will happily tell you.\" He looked towards Draco with complete and total innocence. \"Why, young Draco here has surely heard his father harp on that quirk of mine many a time. Isn\'t that right, Master Malfoy?\"

Draco spluttered, obviously having no idea how best to answer that question. Dumbledore was merciful enough to continue the conversation as if nothing had happened, though Neville did notice the corners of the old man\'s lips threatening to tug upwards.

\"I believe in second chances, Miss Granger. While what you did tonight was very serious and something that is undoubtedly wrong, it is not something I can categorize as evil. I have never expelled a student from this castle, and the first time I do so will not be for three first-year students going out of their way to help a good-hearted man out of a most unfortunate position. Whilst the actions themselves are flawed, the intent was good and pure.

\"Oftentimes, actions are merely the manifestations of poorly thought out ideas and the results of flawed execution. An action can spark from a great many things, not all of which accurately reflect the person who carried them out. Intentions are pure, undiluted, and quintessentially reflective of whomever it is that has them. In my humble opinion, it is intent, not actions, which define a person. Actions are in many ways the brain meddling in things it sometimes shouldn\'t. Intentions are, in the purest form, the most vibrant picture of a person their heart can possibly paint.

\"I will not have either of you, nor your friend, Master Weasley, expelled for acting on such pure intent. Of course, you did break both the rules and the law, so these actions cannot go entirely unpunished. Gryffindor will lose 150 points --- 50 from the both of you and Master Weasley --- and you will all serve detentions once a week until the end of the school year.\"

Malfoy looked livid at this, clearly unable to believe they were getting off --- in his opinion --- so easily. \"What about Hagrid?\" he spat.

Dumbledore suddenly looked very old indeed. \"I have no power over what happens to poor Rubeus. I can only hope the authorities are merciful and advise him the way I think is best going forward.\" Dumbledore glanced up at the clock on his wall. \"On the note of Rubeus, I would like to depart for the Ministry of Magic as soon as possible to see if the Department of Magical Law Enforcement might just hear my take on things. It is already quite late, all things told, so I think I\'d best be on my way if nobody has anything else to add to this late-night meeting.\"

Nobody spoke.

\"Very good. Minerva, Severus, please escort your charges back to their respective common rooms. Master Malfoy, we thank you for your courage in coming forward. You did what was right instead of what was easy, which is an admirable quality in any young wizard. For your courage and upstanding acts, take twenty-five points for Slytherin.\" Dumbledore clambered to his feet. \"And with that,\" he said, striding over to a nearby table, taking a handful of floo powder, and throwing it into the fire. \"I must be off. A good night to all of you.\"

He stepped into the roaring flames and vanished, leaving a very tense silence behind him.

***May 9, 1992***

***The Great Hall***

***8:22 AM***

***HOGWARTS GAMEKEEPER ARRESTED FOR THE BREEDING, OWNING, AND ATTEMPTED SMUGGLING OF A LIVE DRAGON!***

***By Rita Skeeter***

Harry\'s hands shook as he held Pansy\'s copy of the *Daily Prophet* and read the lurid headline.

Draco had been looking extremely smug up until that moment. When Harry took note of the massive decrease in rubies filling the Gryffindor\'s hourglass and then saw the newspaper, Draco\'s face had paled and all swagger was gone.

As for Harry himself, he was furious.

Not only was one of his few genuine friends in the world now in serious trouble with the law solely because of another member of that same, exclusive group, but Draco had lied to him. He had done it to his face and without showing even the slightest sign of guilt.

The worst part was, Harry had known it.

He had almost always known when he was being lied to as a child and he had felt it that day speaking with Draco. The sense that the boy\'s words hadn\'t been honest, but he hadn\'t wanted to believe it.

He had wanted to believe that his new friends were different and that they wouldn\'t lie to him with the same cruel callousness deployed by the Dursleys for ten long years.

The newspaper in Harry\'s hands burst into flames, causing several screams from nearby as it curled into ash on the table in front of him. He looked up to meet Draco\'s eyes and suddenly felt an odd sensation of panic that was most definitely not his own.

It did nothing to quell his rage.

Draco\'s glass exploded, spraying his morning tea this way and that, scalding those unfortunate enough to be in its path.

Harry didn\'t care.

He had gotten to his feet before the glass had fully exploded and --- before any of his friends knew what was happening --- had stormed straight out of the Great Hall.

Still sitting transfixed and frozen in his wake, Draco Malfoy wasn\'t sure what worried him more.

The painful burns that now coated his hands and face, or the livid look his sister was levelling him with. A look that screamed of how, this time, he might truly have ruined everything.

**Author\'s Endnote:**

**Well, this one ended up being longer than I had planned --- especially considering it was at one time going to be conjoined with chapter 9 --- but I\'m actually quite happy with it. I\'ve personally never seen Hagrid actually take the fall for the dragon, which baffles me, so I thought I would switch things up a bit with this story.**

**If you can\'t tell, the ripple effects to what might seem like a minor change will be quite substantial.**

**Two more chapters left to go in book 1, so I hope you\'re already for the climax of first year!**

**Also, I would respectfully ask people to please stop asking about the pairing. I will never answer questions about it and you will not change my mind. It exists, it is not slash, and it is not multi. Beyond that, you will have to keep reading to find out.**

***The Entrance Hall***

***11:00 PM***

It was abnormal for Ron, Hermione, and Neville to be out of bed this late. Curfew had come and gone some time ago and now, the castle was eerily quiet. It was because of this silence that they could hear each shuffling footstep from the squat man who approached them, holding aloft what appeared to be a gas lantern of some sort.

\"Come with me,\" growled Filch, walking straight towards the castle\'s exit without making sure his three charges followed.

They did, but not before exchanging nervous glances.

Glances that only grew all the more fervent as they were led down the sloping lawns, drawing closer and closer to both Hagrid\'s hut and the outskirts of the dark forest that stretched beyond it.

\"Sir,\" asked Hermione in the most polite tone of voice one could possibly imagine. \"Where exactly are we going, if you don\'t mind my asking?\"

Filch took the time to glance at them over his shoulder. The moon was bright in the clear sky and so was his lantern. In their combined light, the three children had no difficulty making out his twisted, cruel expression.

\"The forest is where you\'re goin\'.\" He sounded extremely satisfied, as if nothing could have brought him more pleasure.

\"The f-forest?\" asked Neville.

\"Yes, the forest. Maybe if you opened your ears and listened the first time, you wouldn\'t have to ask the second.\"

Neville flushed a colour as crimson as the hair belonging to the tall, gangly boy who walked alongside him. \"S-sorry,\" he stammered, \"it\'s just... the forest is supposed to have all sorts of dangerous creatures, isn\'t it?\"

Filch shrugged in an unconcerned sort of way, though all three of them could tell he was greatly amused by the whole thing. \"Shoulda thought of them creatures before you went and broke the rules, eh?\"

Ron opened his mouth, but he closed it promptly when Hermione stomped painfully on his foot. They had not only violated school rules, but they had quite literally broken the law. As far as she was concerned, they had gotten off easy. It wasn\'t something she wanted to risk making worse, particularly in light of that fact.

\"Is that you, Filch?\" It was a voice none of the Gryffindors had heard before. A voice that sounded rough, but also as though it belonged to an old man.

\"The first years, Professor Kettleburn,\" Filch said oily. \"Here for their... punishment.\"

\"I know why they\'re here, you cantankerous old lump.\" Filch opened his mouth, then closed it, grinding his teeth together whilst the other man huffed indignantly.

\"They\'re here to be punished, remember,\" Filch gritted out through clenched teeth. \"You mustn\'t be too nice to them---\"

\"I haven\'t even spoken to them yet, you miserable old prune.\" Filch spluttered, looking more and more furious by the second. \"Just because I enjoy making you look like an arse doesn\'t mean I don\'t know what detention is. Really, I think that\'s your problem. What would you have done with them, you greasy codger? Strung them up by their wrists and ankles while you whipped them until their skin was raw?\" He huffed. \"Honestly, between you thinking I can\'t hear and don\'t understand what the hell a detention is, and the tossers on the board of governors thinking I can\'t teach just because I\'m missing a finger or two, this job is getting old very fast.

\"Now,\" he said, gesturing sharply in the direction of the castle. \"If you can\'t tell by now, your pitiful presence isn\'t needed or wanted. Off with you, you miserable old goat.\" Filch looked livid, but he shuffled back up towards the castle\'s hulking outline nevertheless.

\"Pathetic,\" the professor muttered under his breath. \"He\'s as useless as that Merlin-forsaken poltergeist. Honestly, we have house-elves for a reason. Why can\'t we just bin the git?\" He shook his head as if realizing where he was and who was standing in front of him. \"Right, sorry about all that, lads and lass. I\'ve never gotten on with that useless sack of dragon dung.\"

Ron and Neville were too busy trying to not crack up to respond. Hermione looked utterly appalled, but she managed to compose herself and speak nonetheless. \"It\'s... okay, Professor\...?\"

\"Kettleburn,\" he said. \"I\'ve been teaching Care of Magical Creatures since before any of your parents were even thought of.\" Neville gave an odd twitch at this. Ron didn\'t notice and Hermione didn\'t quite understand why, so the moment passed without comment.

\"Sir,\" asked Ron, finally over his amusement and now shifting back and forth in obvious discomfort. \"Are we really going into the Forbidden Forest?\"

\"Yep,\" said Kettleburn, sounding entirely unconcerned. \"I\'m just gonna get that old hound from Hagrid\'s hut, make sure you lot at least know how to shoot up sparks, split us into two groups, and we\'ll be off.\"

\"But... why are we going in there?\" Ron asked. \"Isn\'t it supposed to be really dangerous?\"

\"Most of what\'s in there is harmless to us. Just don\'t piss it off and we\'ll be all right.\"

\"And... why?\"

\"Hm? Oh yes, that. Something has been attacking unicorns and one\'s been injured for days, just stumbling around and waiting to die. We\'ll be finding it and hopefully saving it.\" The man grimaced. \"More likely, we\'ll be putting it out of its misery.\"

Neville gulped. \"And... what if whatever\'s killing the unicorns finds us before we find the one it\'s been hunting?\"

Kettleburn waved his hand, which did indeed appear to be missing two fingers. \"Semantics, my dear boy. Now, come with me; let\'s get this old, fat dog some exercise.\"

***A few hours later, in the Slytherin dorms...***

Harry stood in a dark, cavernous room; the likes of which he\'d never seen before. The closest comparable he had were the underground tunnels at Gringotts. Somehow, he could tell that this room was situated far beneath the earth\'s surface. Harry felt like the ceiling was very high, though the room itself was so dark, he couldn\'t possibly be sure.

As if the thought had spurred them on, oil-fuelled torches burst into light all around the room, flickering ominously and casting long, dark shadows across the floor and walls; all of which seemed hewn from the same, rough stone.

Then, something else caught Harry\'s attention.

There was but one thing in this vast, mysterious place, but Harry recognized it at once.

An ornate mirror taller than he was, one which showed him only the barest outlines of shadowy things he could not identify. The mirror\'s surface sparkled invitingly in the torchlight, but this time, Harry averted his eyes. He remembered what Professor Dumbledore had told him about this particular mirror.

\"*This mirror will give us neither knowledge nor truth, Harry. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. The mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, and I ask you not to go looking for it. If you ever do come across it again, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live. Remember that.\"*

He averted his eyes from the mirror just as a rushing sound erupted from behind him. He spun to see towering black flames roaring and impeding what seemed to be this place\'s only exit.

Or, perhaps, they were an attempt to block its only entrance, for the silhouette of a figure could be seen in the fire not a moment later.

Before Harry could identify the hooded man whose face was cast in shadow, he almost gasped at the sight of glowing red eyes. Then, a wand was brandished and there was a horrible flash of blinding green light. Harry jolted awake in the Slytherin dormitory, shaking and sweating as if he had a horrid fever.

Harry stood shakily, trying to gain control of his breathing as he tried to ignore his pounding headache and made sure not to wake Draco. His eyes fell on his treasured cloak.

He needed a walk.

***Later, in the Forbidden Forest\...***

The foliage only grew thicker as Neville, Hermione, and Fang strode deeper and deeper down their chosen path. Ron and the eccentric Professor Kettleburn had gone in a different direction, but not before encountering several centaurs. Kettleburn had merely greeted them, inclined his head, and moved on, though all of them could feel the creatures\' eyes following them as they continued on their respective paths.

It had been difficult to track the unicorn blood for quite some time. The forest canopy obscured much of the light coming from above, which was mostly limited. Though the moon shone brightly, the thick veil of clouds seemed to scud in its way, obscuring its luminescent light.

Thankfully, the blood itself was a silvery colour that was hard to miss. It was now growing thicker as, up ahead, the two students and one boarhound could make out a break in the foliage.

They stepped into the clearing just as the clouds seemed to take pity on the moon, allowing its silvery spotlight to reach them once more.

The scene the light illuminated before them was as majestic as it was appalling.

A brilliant creature laid prone and helpless in the centre of the clearing, legs jutting out at odd angles and head lulled. It was clear the creature was dead, though judging by the blood still gently oozing from the gaping hole in the unicorn\'s side, it hadn\'t been that way for long.

The silvery substance pooled all around it, gleaming in the moonlight in magical ways, seeming to send impossible sparks of light dancing incomprehensibly, as if the very photons were mourning the death of such a precious manifestation of purity and happiness.

Naturally, the scene of morbid tranquillity set out before them could not persist for long.

There came a rustling from across the clearing, like some great serpent slithering menacingly across the fallen leaves. Hermione instinctively clasped her hand over the boarhound\'s mouth to stop it from crying out as it had earlier that night when a similar sound had made itself known.

This time, they got to see exactly what was causing it.

A figure strode purposefully forward. It was of average height for a man and was donned in a black, hooded cloak. The cloak was long; it covered the figure\'s hands and the garment was obviously what had been rustling the leaves.

It crept slowly towards the fallen unicorn without a glance around the clearing. That at least was fortunate, for it most definitely would have spotted the two youths watching it, as well as their four-legged companion.

Fang shook free of Hermione\'s grip just as the figure bent its hooded head over the gaping wound and began to drink the creature\'s blood.

Neville gagged and Hermione paled, but Fang\'s booming bark was what alerted the figure to their presence.

By the time it stood, the hound had bolted, pulling Hermione --- who had attempted to take hold of his collar --- to the forest floor, where she lay prone and terrified.

Neville felt the start of panic tear at his innards, but the boy suddenly had an epiphany not too dissimilar from the one he\'d had the night of Samhain. The one that he credited as the beginning of a much-needed shift in his character.

He was not going to let his friend die here in this forest.

He was the son of Frank and Alice Longbottom, two of the best aurors the Ministry of Magic had seen in decades. He was the heir to not only their legacy, but a Founding Twelve family, and he was also a Gryffindor. It was times like this when one needed to choose between what was right and what was easy.

He drew his wand and stepped forward, levelling it at the figure and hoping it didn\'t see the way his arm shook. \"Who are you and what do you want?\"

The figure didn\'t respond. It instead reached into a pocket of its robes and withdrew its own wand. It was long and dark, and it was what the figure aimed at Neville with.

Neville simply reacted, firing off a Leg-Locker in hopes it might take the figure off guard.

Since he had purchased his new wand, Neville\'s performance during class had indeed improved. He wasn\'t all of a sudden Merlin or any such nonsense, but he had definitely progressed in his ability. Transfiguration still gave him problems --- to say the least --- and he was far from outstanding at Charms. Potions was really best left unspoken of, though he was at least good at Herbology.

As well as Defence Against the Dark Arts... Neville seemed to have a talent for that class.

The spell he chose was an early second-year incarnation and it flew towards the figure at top speed.

Neville was somewhat surprised he\'d gotten it to work so well, but all pride died in his chest when the figure casually batted it away with a mere flick of his wand, the tip of which was now glowing a vibrant red colour as it aimed directly at Neville, who realized by now he would die at any moment.

Before the blow could come, the foliage exploded and out of it charged a creature Neville had only seen once before. It had been earlier that very night, in fact.

The centaur leapt through the air, lashing out at the figure with its hoof. The cloaked being barely evaded, casting several spells to hold the centaur at bay before it fled from the clearing at a run, leaving the half-man, half-horse creature alone with a shaking Neville and a quietly sobbing Hermione.

\"Are you all right?\"

Its voice was deep and smooth, and it spoke of concern and worry. More than anything, though, it stayed calm and did not waver.

\"Y-y-yes,\" stammered Neville, his eyes still fixed on where his assailant had stood. \"What-what was that?\"

The centaur didn\'t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at both Neville and Hermione --- who was once more on her feet --- and his eyes lingered on the former.

\"You are the Longbottom boy,\" he said. \"You had better get back to Kettleburn. The forest is not safe at this time. Can the two of you ride? It will be quicker this way.

\"My name is Firenze,\" he added as he lowered himself onto his front legs so that both Neville and Hermione could clamber onto his back.

There suddenly came the sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Two of the centaurs from earlier that night came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.

\"Firenze!\" the more fierce-looking of the two thundered. \"What are you doing? You have humans on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\"

\"Do you not understand who these humans are, Bane?\"

\"What have you been telling them?\" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?\"

Ronan pawed the ground nervously. \"I\'m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,\" he said in a gloomy sort of voice.

Bane kicked his back legs in anger. \"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\"

Firenze suddenly reared onto his hind legs in anger, so Neville had to grab his shoulders and Hermione had to grab Neville to stay on.

\"Do you not see that unicorn?\" Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane. Yes, with humans alongside me if I must!\"

Firenze whisked around with the pair of first years on his back clutching on as best they could. They then plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.

\"What was that about?\" asked Neville once they were out of hearing range. \"Why are they so upset? And what was that thing you saved us from?\"

Firenze slowed to a walk, warning both of his passengers to keep their heads bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Neville\'s question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Neville thought Firenze didn\'t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when the centaur suddenly stopped.

\"Do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\" he asked the two of them.

\"No,\" said Neville, startled by the odd question.

Even Hermione seemed perplexed. \"We\'ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\"

\"That is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn,\" said Firenze. \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenceless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\"

Neville stared at the back of Firenze\'s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.

\"But who would be that desperate?\" Hermione wondered aloud. \"If you\'re going to be cursed forever, death is better, isn\'t it?\"

\"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else --- something that will bring you back to full strength and power --- something that will mean you can never die. Do either of you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\"

\"The Philosopher\'s Stone! Of course --- the Elixir of Life! But I don\'t understand who---\"

\"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, Miss Granger? Nobody who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\"

It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Neville\'s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, Neville swore he could hear his own heart beating along with the rhythmic padding of his escort\'s hooves.

There had been rumours for years among the most well-educated of Britain\'s wizarding population. Rumours that an event so integral to the country\'s history hadn\'t quite gone exactly as the media had portrayed it. Why, even his gran had her doubts as to whether that fateful night had been quite as magical as some had thought.

But surely, Firenze couldn\'t mean...

\"Neville, Hermione!\" It was Ron\'s voice calling to them as he, Kettleburn, and Fang --- who must have found them after bolting off into the forest --- approached.

\"Go to them, but remember what I have said,\" intoned Firenze. \"Remember all you have heard and remember that Mars shines bright tonight. It is a herald of things to come.\"

Just like that, Firenze prompted their dismount and bolted back off into the forest; a state of awestruck shock, disbelief, and terror befalling the both of them.

Could it truly be possible that Lord Voldemort was seeking to return to power?

***Sometime later, atop a balcony overlooking the grounds\...***

Harry had wandered the school for some time before he realized sleep wasn\'t going to be an option. His mind was now active and reeling, thinking on a great many things; things that most certainly did not lend themselves at all well to the realm of Morpheus.

He tried to get his mind off of the dream he had experienced. Exploring the castle had worked for a time, but the thoughts could only be held at bay for so long before they reared their ugly heads with renewed vigour and resolute determination.

The problem was that even before that time, his default thoughts --- not associated with the dream, that is --- were of his friends. While that wasn\'t a bad thing in and of itself, it made him think of his current predicament with Draco.

That was... complicated, and it was most certainly not what he wanted to think about at this time of night while less than emotionally stable.

It was that thought which had brought him to the same balcony he had shared twice with Diana earlier in the year whilst they had spoken of things which had, at the time, left him in a state not too dissimilar to the one he found himself in on this night.

It was only now that Harry realized this place had become a sort of haven for him.

The sun had not yet risen, but it had begun to tease the horizon with its bright halo of light. The moon could still be seen high in the sky, but its light was less vivid now. The sky around it was becoming brighter, and Harry was beginning to be able to see the grounds and all that they contained more clearly.

What they contained on this morning appeared to be a procession of four walking towards the castle.

This piqued Harry\'s interest and he squinted.

It was difficult to tell exactly from this height, but he could definitely make out the vivid red hair of a Weasley, and he thought one of the figures looked an awful lot like Hermione Granger.

The question was, what on earth were the two of them --- and presumably Longbottom --- doing out on the grounds at this ungodly hour of the morning?

Harry knew it was a question best left unanswered and one that he certainly didn\'t have the necessary pieces to solve.

But still... he couldn\'t help but feel it was oddly significant somehow. He couldn\'t help but feel he was missing something important.

Something that was connected to why they were there in the first place.

***Several hours later, at Malfoy Manor\...***

Malfoy Manor\'s immaculate informal dining room was mostly quiet aside from the occasional clattering of cutlery as the lord and the lady of the house finished their meals in silence.

Narcissa was not a morning person, so Lucius was surprised she was even awake. He would have been even more surprised if she were talkative at this time of the morning, and he\'d never had an aversion to spending time with his own thoughts. It was often when many of his more ingenious ideas would come to him.

*CRACK!*

He could have sighed aloud when one of the infernal creatures that manned the house appeared before him as if summoned by the mere thought of his enjoyment of solitude.

He took a long, languid sip of tea as he enjoyed how the pitiful thing squirmed before him, obviously worried what mood it might find its master in this morning.

\"What is it?\" When Lucius finally spoke, his voice was cool and emotionless.

\"A letter, sir and miss,\" said the elf, his tennis ball-sized eyes looking anywhere but at his masters.

\"Give it here.\" The elf levitated the envelope onto the table. It knew it wasn\'t to touch anything its master might touch soon after. That had led to punishments in the past.

Lucius opened the envelope with a lazy flick of his wand and withdrew the plain-looking bit of parchment within.

Its contents were anything but plain.

By the time Lucius had finished reading the very brief missive, he was deathly pale. His wife had leant over to read it as well, but before she could, the envelope burst into flames, curling into ash on the table.

Ash which briefly rested in a very distinct shape on the table before it too vanished.

A skull --- one with a serpentine tongue protruding from its mouth.

***On the Way to the Slytherin Common Room***

***8:49 PM***

It had been an odd few weeks for Harry since the dragon incident had been not-so-peacefully resolved.

None in the castle had seen Hagrid since that night, which caused many rumours to spread like hissing wildfires. If Pansy was to be believed --- and she was rarely wrong about such things --- Hagrid would be put on trial in July. Until then, he would be held at the ministry in a holding cell. The wizarding government of Magical Britain apparently wasn\'t all that concerned with making this trial punctual. Pansy said it just wasn\'t really that important in the grand scheme of things, but Harry didn\'t see why they couldn\'t at least do Hagrid the favour of a quick trial.

He hadn\'t spoken with Draco since that morning in the Great Hall when he had inadvertently set his newspaper ablaze and caused the youngest Malfoy\'s mug of tea to explode. Allegedly, Draco needed a burn salve from Madam Pomfrey, but Harry wasn\'t punished for the incident. He had been asked to stay behind in Potions the next time the class arose on his timetable, but Snape had just advised him to keep a much firmer grip on his emotions.

It had really been awkward ever since that morning. Theodore had been the one who had stuck most closely with Harry. They spent much of their time in the library; with Theodore mostly studying for the fast-approaching exams and Harry looking ahead to the second-year material. Pansy flitted between Harry and Draco, trying to play diplomat between the two of them. Draco apparently felt quite awful about what had happened, but Harry couldn\'t bring himself to care. Unless Draco had the stones to come and tell it to him in person, Harry would be having none of it.

Diana had briefly approached Harry, but she hadn\'t pressed him about the incident with Draco. It had just been a reminder that her brother could be a right prat sometimes and that if Harry ever needed to talk, she was always available.

Tonight was one of the rare instances Harry was alone. Theodore was studying in the library, but Harry hadn\'t been all that interested. He had been more inclined to explore the castle under his invisibility cloak; an activity which had become a favourite pastime of his ever since he had received the magical artifact on the night of Yule.

He was nearing a staircase that would take him down to the castle\'s ground floor when he stopped. He had an odd feeling he was no longer alone; a feeling that was validated seconds later when Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Neville Longbottom came around the corner.

Harry\'s attention suddenly piqued for reasons he could not entirely articulate. Their heads were pressed together and they were discussing something in frantic, hissing whispers. Harry could feel it was important. It was much like the way he could tell when somebody was lying; he could feel their unease and guilt as they spoke. He could feel the nervousness, anxiety, and downright fear rolling off these three first years in waves.

He wasn\'t sure what made him follow them, still under the guise of his cloak, but he wanted to know what it was that had terrified them so much. Especially after spotting their ascent up to the castle at such an ungodly hour earlier in the week. What was it that could make those who dwelled within the house of the brave so very worried?

\"\...he\'s not going to hold out much longer,\" Granger was whispering as the three of them stepped into an abandoned classroom. Harry just managed to follow stealthily behind them right before the door closed.

\"What happens if he gives in?\" Longbottom\'s voice was frantic, panicked, even.

\"We\'ll have to do something,\" said Weasley. \"It might get us into trouble if the teachers find out how much we know, but we can\'t let Snape get the stone. Especially not if he really is going to give it to... him.\"

The... stone? What on earth could Professor Snape want with a stone? A bezoar, perhaps, but if they were talking about that particular kind of stone, surely they would have called it by name.

\"I think we\'re all forgetting something,\" said Granger. \"If it really is You-Know-Who that\'s coming after the Philosopher\'s Stone, wasn\'t it said that Professor Dumbledore was the only one he was ever afraid of?\"

\"Yup,\" said Ron while Harry felt a wave of shock bowl straight over him. \"Even when he was strongest, the dark git never attacked Hogwarts.\"

\"Well, there you go. So long as Professor Dumbledore is here, we should be safe, right?\"

Harry knew she didn\'t believe it and he was pretty sure neither Weasley nor Longbottom were fooled either.

Though he couldn\'t be certain.

He was far too busy reeling from that last revelation.

You-Know-Who after a Philosopher\'s Stone?

The only Philosopher\'s Stone he had ever heard of had been featured in muggle myths. A stone so fantastical that Harry couldn\'t even believe it existed in this wild world of magic. If he was remembering correctly, it had the power to turn any metal into gold and make the drinker immortal.

If such a stone existed...

If Granger, of all people, was talking about such a stone, it wasn\'t terribly far out of the question that it may well exist.

And if it did...

Voldemort going after a stone like that... Suddenly, he was back in the shack on that rock again and Hagrid\'s words were ringing in his ears once more.

\"*Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\"*

Could it really be possible that Voldemort was alive and seeking the Philosopher\'s Stone? He knew that the official stance was that Voldemort had died the night he attacked Harry and his family, but he also knew that some, like Hagrid, were more sceptical of that conclusion.

But if he was back...

He had wanted to kill Harry and his parents before. Was it possible he would try and kill Harry again? Even if he hadn\'t been the true target the first time, he had sought to kill him. More importantly, he had failed. Harry didn\'t know much about Voldemort, but from the little he did know, he could easily see vengeance being a powerful motivator. If Hagrid was to be believed, many thought the reason he\'d attacked the Potters in the first place was that they had refused to join him.

That made the idea of him attacking Harry as soon as he returned to power all the more probable.

But, surely, this was all ridiculous.

Weasley, Granger, and Longbottom were all schoolchildren, just like Harry. He knew too well the tendency most schoolchildren had to exaggerate events. It was far more likely that they were making fantastical tales out of things they didn\'t really understand.

Yes, that would probably be it. If Voldemort really was alive and on the prowl once more, it wasn\'t as though Weasley, Granger, or Longbottom would know about it.

That was what Harry told himself, anyway. He needed to tell himself *something* to keep the terror at bay, even if that thing wasn\'t entirely successful at doing that.

***June 4, 1992***

***The Entrance Hall***

***3:52 PM***

The sound of bustling students could be heard all throughout the castle. Most of the students in question were flooding into the castle\'s entrance hall and out the large, oak front doors.

It was only natural, of course. Exams had just concluded and with their passing went any educational obligations the students had until September. This alone would have driven most out of the castle. Add to that the fact the sky outside was a vibrant blue so bright and unblemished that its presence would not have seemed out of place in some fantastical utopia, and it was really a no-brainer for the students to flock out onto the ground.

Such was the case for almost all in the castle, but there were a few notable exceptions.

Namely, a trio of first-year Gryffindor students who had just sat their final exam of the year --- History of Magic --- and who were actually just as stressed as they were relieved.

Days had passed since they had overheard Quirrell wilting under the pressure applied to him by Snape and they knew the Potions Master\'s time was running out. If he or Voldemort were to make a move on the Philosopher\'s Stone, it would need to be made soon.

And something seemed auspicious about this day.

Perhaps it was the utopian feel of it all. Maybe it just felt too perfect and the fact was triggering the youths\' paranoia. Or perhaps striking on a day like this really was the most Slytherin thing to do and all three of them knew it.

They just felt like something was going to happen and they felt it finally time to make the man in charge of the castle they resided in aware of such things.

They had spoken at length about the whole situation quite frequently over the past few days and had come to a number of disturbing revelations.

Not least of which was that it had been distinctly odd how Hagrid had gotten his massive hands on the egg. The thing he wanted most in the world just so happened to show up right in front of him, just as the person delivering it seemed to have been oh so interested in something the giant man himself owned.

It was a touch too convenient for the trio\'s liking.

\"What if it was You-Know-Who under that hood?\" Ron had asked. \"It seems the obvious thing to do, doesn\'t it?\"

Neither Neville nor even Hermione had been able to dispute the logic of such things. Hermione had managed to convince the others to wait until exams were over before running off to Dumbledore --- but the time for stalling had now officially come to an end. They could not wait idly around any longer.

\"What are you three doing inside?\"

It was Professor McGonagall and she was carrying a large pile of books.

\"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hermione.

\"See Professor Dumbledore?\" Professor McGonagall repeated with narrowed eyes. It was clear even to the three Gryffindors that their unusual request had raised the woman\'s suspicion at once. \"And why exactly would you want to do that?\"

\"It\'s sort of\... secret,\" said Ron, unable to think of anything better on the spot. He suddenly wished he had because Professor McGonagall\'s nostrils flared.

\"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\"

\"He\'s gone?\" Neville said frantically. \"Now?\"

\"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Longbottom, he has many demands on his time---\"

\"But this is important,\" cut in Ron.

\"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic?\"

\"Look,\" Ron continued, throwing caution to the winds. \"Professor... it\'s about the Philosopher\'s Stone---\"

A resounding crash echoed through the hall, clear remnants of Professor McGonagall\'s most recent action, which had been dropping the stack of books that had been precariously balanced in her arms a second earlier. She looked both livid and shocked, and it was a combination that put all three students on edge.

Hermione spoke next, obviously realizing that allowing Professor McGonagall to begin on a tirade would be unwise. \"Professor, we think --- we know --- that Sn-that someone\'s going to try and steal the stone. We\'ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\"

McGonagall now looked a mixture of dazed and annoyed, as well as more than a tad flustered. \"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\" she said finally. \"I don\'t know how you found out about the stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it. It is far too well protected.\"

\"But, Professor---\"

\"Granger, I know what I\'m talking about.\" She gathered up the fallen books with a wave of her wand. \"I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.\"

But they didn\'t.

They did a far more Gryffindor-like thing than simply following orders.

They acted and made a plan of their own.

***Meanwhile, out on the grounds...***

It really was a beautiful day, Harry thought as the warm summer breeze rustled his unkempt black hair and teased his skin. He bathed in the warmth and light of the day as he flew like a bird through the sky, laughing and shouting alongside his older companion, who flew beside him and basked in the glow with an equal amount of delight.

Harry had just finished his final exam and with it, his first year was all but in the books. Now, he had only to wait for the final weeks to pass and for his marks to come back.

There was a small part of him that dreaded the fast-approaching year\'s end because with it, he might well need to return to the Dursleys. The best thing about the year hadn\'t been the magic, nor the people, nor even the castle itself; though Harry had immensely enjoyed all of those things. The absolute best part of the year had been that, for its duration, he had been free of the people who had made his life hell since before the age of two.

He still planned to ask Dumbledore whether or not he could stay at Hogwarts over the summer holidays, but his hopes were not high. He had subtly brought it up to Draco a couple of months back when they had still been on speaking terms. The blond had responded by saying that, as far as he knew, no one had ever stayed at Hogwarts during the summer.

Despite the dread and worry that threatened to flood into his chest, Harry managed to stay feeling light and free. A protective bubble of happiness seemed to be keeping those dark thoughts at bay, and it was something Harry was very grateful for.

\"Down there!\" called Cassius, catching Harry\'s attention and gesturing to a large tree near the lake.

Beneath the massive tree sat Diana and her friends as well as Draco, Pansy, Theodore, Crabbe, and Goyle. Harry and Cassius swooped around the tree and came in for a landing much the same way Harry and Draco had all those months ago when Cassius had first seen Harry fly.

When they landed, Harry\'s emerald eyes briefly met the stormy grey of Draco\'s, but they didn\'t linger long. Harry\'s attention was instead drawn to Diana, who was laying out a full-scale picnic for all of them, whilst her friend --- Yaxley --- spread out a blanket large enough to accommodate all present.

\"To the end of another year,\" said Diana once everyone had a beverage in hand. \"And to many more good ones to come.\"

They all toasted and drank. In that moment, Harry couldn\'t perceive a thing that would effectively manage to burst his bubble of euphoric happiness.

It truly was just a day worth celebrating.

***Later that night, in the dungeons...***

Harry breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Draco slipping off towards the dormitories. He had been pursuing Harry for the better part of the day, but the last Potter just wasn\'t at all interested at the moment. He had been having quite an enjoyable day. The last thing he wanted at the moment was to have a deep, potentially emotionally charged conversation. He would talk it out with Draco and he really did hope they would re-establish their friendship. He just knew that today wasn\'t that day and that it would need to wait until he was in a different state of mind.

He had also been experiencing horrible headaches for the last day that he couldn\'t quite explain. Having that discussion right now really wasn\'t the best of ideas.

Once Draco had gone off to bed, Harry decided it was time to go exploring. He had discovered many secret passages and other interesting oddities of the castle over the year. Rather than satisfy his thirst, they had only made him all the more insatiable, which was how he found himself stalking out of the dungeons under the invisibility cloak on this particular evening.

One floor he hadn\'t explored quite so thoroughly was the third. There was of course the out-of-bounds corridor on the right-hand side, so Harry had avoided the floor as a general rule. Before he\'d had the cloak, he had been worried about getting caught anywhere near the off-limits corridor. That was no longer a problem, but the habit had already been long-established by the time he had received his most prized possession.

With exams for the year over, however, Harry suddenly felt bolder than he had before, so he thought tonight was the night.

After arriving on the floor in question, it took about three seconds for him to find something of interest.

Muffled voices were coming from around a corner and Harry stealthily snuck towards them, curious to see what it was that was happening.

\"I heard you,\" Peeves was saying in a sing-song voice, eyes flitting all around the corridor. \"Peevesey knows he heard you. Come out, come out, wherever you are, little students. Peevesey just wants to play.\" No one moved and the poltergeist crossed his arms. \"If you don\'t come out and Peevesey finds out, he\'ll turn you in to the greasy old caretaker.\"

Still, no one moved and this time, the poltergeist actually huffed before zipping off down the corridor, clanging every suit of armour as he went; probably as a way of venting his obvious frustration.

Harry wondered what that was all about until three figures stepped out from an alcove Harry actually had not yet found. He was somewhat taken aback by how unsurprised he was to see Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom, and Hermione Granger. It was as if these three were everywhere.

\"That was close,\" he heard Weasley mutter. \"Imagine we\'d been caught by Peeves. Wouldn\'t even make it to the bloody corridor.\"

\"Shh,\" urged Granger, briefly covering Weasley\'s mouth with a hand before leading them off towards what Harry immediately realized to be the off-limits third-floor corridor.

He actually found himself incredulous a moment or so later when the very door that had been shrouded in such mystery yielded to a simple Unlocking Charm.

The three Gryffindors were in the corridor and had closed the door before Harry could see what it was that lurked inside, but his heart was racing as his brain began to connect the dots.

Weasley, Granger, and Longbottom had been talking days earlier about the Philosopher\'s Stone and of how Snape --- or maybe even Voldemort --- could potentially be after it. Harry had dismissed these comments as heresy. He still found the idea of either Snape or Voldemort going after the stone ridiculous, but it was said that oftentimes, the truth laid between two extremes.

So was it possible at least part of the trio\'s tale had been true?

Was it possible that the famous Philosopher\'s Stone was the treasure situated in the corridor?

A lot about that hypothesis was problematic, but Harry decided it was best to at least pretend it could be viable.

He wouldn\'t be risking his life to find out, but surely there couldn\'t be any harm in waiting outside the corridor to see what happened when the trio eventually emerged.

Or didn\'t, he supposed. Out of bounds to all who do not wish to die a very painful death, and all that.

Harry shrugged; he supposed he would just need to wait and see. He was hidden under his cloak, so getting caught wasn\'t exactly a risk he needed to worry about and by now, he was much too curious to turn back.

***Sometime later, in the catacombs beneath Hogwarts...***

Neville faced the black fire before him with a resolute expression.

He still thought Hermione sending him of all people forward was one of the craziest ideas anyone had ever had, but he hadn\'t been able to come up with a good enough argument off the cuff. He was better at Defence Against the Dark Arts, and it was true she could probably get back up to the main castle to search for a professor faster than he could

That still didn\'t mean he adored the prospect of facing down what could potentially be Lord Voldemort. It might only be Snape, but that was hardly a favourable challenge, either.

He wasn\'t sure what allowed him to do it. He couldn\'t entirely quantify it; all he knew was that it was the same fire that had filled him to the brim back in the forbidden forest that previous week and in the bathroom on Samhain.

Just like he couldn\'t let his friends die, he couldn\'t let Voldemort get the Philosopher\'s Stone. Not after the monster had left so many families like his own broken and ruined in his wake of death and destruction. Even if he ignored the atrocities of the past, Neville could not allow a future to exist where Voldemort had returned. Not only would the country be in disarray once more, but people like Hermione would be hunted to extinction if the mass-murdering psychopath had his way.

He drank the potion and walked forward, marvelling at how the black flames --- which completely obscured his vision --- did little more than tickle his skin. It felt more like submerging in a pleasant bath than walking through ten-foot-high flames.

Soon enough, the sensation had passed entirely, for Neville had entered what he instinctively knew to be the final room.

It was dark and vast like an ancient cavern, with a high ceiling and smooth stone floor and walls. The room was entirely empty except for its two notable exceptions.

The first was a tall, ornate mirror with an odd engraving that Neville couldn\'t make heads or tails of. It was unlike any mirror Neville had ever seen.

The other exception to the room\'s emptiness was a hooded figure who stood directly in front of the mirror. Neville quickly realized the cloak it wore was eerily similar to the one he had seen in the forest.

He raised his wand, hand shaking, and aimed.

\"You can come out,\" called a soft voice from near the mirror. \"I know you\'re here.\"

Neville fired off three spells in quick succession, but they all splashed harmlessly against a lazily conjured shield.

Fire raced towards Neville, who dove to the side. The flames followed him but --- just before burning him to death --- their tendrils cooled, solidified, and morphed into rough ropes that bound Neville\'s arms and legs together. His wand went clattering to the floor at his feet while he himself collapsed in a heap directly next to it.

\"So it\'s you, is it?\" asked the voice that Neville actually hadn\'t been able to identify until now. He had heard it plenty of times, but it had stuttered around him.

It was Professor Quirrell.

\"I\'ll admit, I wasn\'t sure whom to expect. I was hoping for Potter, though I knew it was a slim chance at best. He seems to have more sense than to rush off into battles he can\'t win.\" His eyes gleamed. \"You though... you may actually be better suited for what I need. I\'m not quite sure Potter actually has the heart for this little trick to work.\"

Quirrell twitched his wand and Neville was jerked to his feet and dragged forward by the ropes that bound him.

\"Why you?\" he asked, knowing he had to keep him talking. \"We were expecting Snape!\"

\"Were you now?\" asked Quirrell, sounding amused. \"Severus is many things, but I do not think he is loyal to me any longer. I think that bridge was burned a great many years ago now.\"

Loyal to... me?

Snape had never been loyal to Quirrell, but according to Neville\'s gran, he had been rumoured to be loyal to another at one point.

Which meant...

\"You\'re... him!\"

The man or monster wearing Quirrell\'s skin tilted his head. \"What an interestingly complex question,\" he mused. \"I am, and I\'m not. I\'m certainly not Quirinus Quirrell, but I don\'t think I can say that I am Lord Voldemort quite yet, either.\"

\"Then who... what---\"

\"Enough talking,\" the assailant snapped. \"What I want from you, Neville Longbottom, is your compliance. Look into that mirror while thinking of the Philosopher\'s Stone and tell me exactly what it is you see. Do not lie to me. I will know if you lie.\"

\"Why should I listen to you?\"

\"Because if you don\'t, I will simply force you to do it with magic. I am not a man of many morals, but I am not a liar. You can trust me when I say it will be much easier for you if you look into that mirror of your own free will.\"

\"It won\'t matter,\" gritted out Neville. \"Hermione\'s off to get the professors, maybe even Dumbledore if he\'s back. You\'ll never get out with the stone, even if you do get it.\"

\"By the time Albus Dumbledore reaches this castle, I will be gone. Anyone short of him will be swiftly and easily dealt with. Now,\" he snapped, \"look into the mirror and tell me what you see!\"

Neville felt the ropes contract painfully around his throat and he immediately realized he had no choice but to comply.

When he glanced into the mirror, he first saw the smiling face of two people whom he recognized very well, though he had never seen them this healthy in life.

Then, the image slowly changed.

Those people were lying in hospital beds, looking much more like how Neville knew them. He was there, too, but there was something different about him. He looked more confident than Neville had ever felt as he reached into the pocket of his robes and produced two vials of golden liquid. He handed one to each of his parents before reaching into his robes once more. He withdrew a blood-red stone, turned it over in his hands, winked, and plopped it back into his pocket.

And that was when Neville felt the stone appear just where his mirror-self had put it.

\"Excellent,\" said the man behind him with satisfaction and Neville could only feel complete terror at the fact he had immediately known when the stone had appeared to him. \"I\'m afraid your questions will remain unanswered, Longbottom. Your words of the other professors hold true and this will be much easier if I make haste. I thank you for your assistance... both willing and unwilling.\"

A flash of red light illuminated Neville\'s vision and then he saw no more.

***Minutes later, back outside the third-floor corridor...***

Harry had begun to seriously consider just going back to the common room after so much time had passed; but his patience was rewarded by something of interest not minutes after those contemplations had begun.

He found himself beyond perplexed when a frantic-looking Hermione Granger exploded out of the corridor and charged down the hall at a flat sprint, disappearing quickly around the nearest corner and running still further out of sight.

This made Harry frown, but he was at least reasonably sure something more was going to happen that might pique his interest.

If he had known what said thing would be, he would never have waited there in the corridor.

It was some time before the door leading to the forbidden hall opened once more, but when it did, it was no panicked school child that exited.

It was a hooded man whom Harry recognized nonetheless as the nearest torch did indeed manage to cast his face into sharp relief.

Seeing his favourite professor exit from the forbidden corridor might have been surprising enough, but that wasn\'t the sight that made Harry gasp aloud.

That was the sight of Neville Longbottom, helpless, bound by ropes, and clearly unconscious while he floated alongside the professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts.

The same professor froze at the sound of Harry\'s gasp. \"Who\'s there?\" asked Quirrell in a voice as sharp as steel. Harry did not so much as move as he watched Quirrell\'s wand raise.

His heart stopped beating for a second. Never had he put his cloak to the test against actual detection spells. He knew they existed, but nobody had ever suspected his presence while he had been wearing his most precious piece of clothing. He had no idea whether it would stand up to whatever Quirrell was about to cast, nor did he want to know.

He liked Quirrell; the man had actually been his favourite professor --- even despite the constant headaches Harry felt while in his class --- but Harry was no fool and he thought he had a pretty good idea of what was going on here.

He, like every other student at Hogwarts, was all too aware of the supposed curse placed upon the Defence Against the Dark Arts position many years ago. Not one professor had lasted the entire year in decades and Harry had heard the phrase \'When in doubt, blame the Defence professor,\' more than once.

And here was Quirrell, a competent but also quiet and mysterious man, exiting the forbidden corridor that may or may not house the Philosopher\'s Stone at an ungodly hour.

Oh, and he had a hostage. There was also that.

Harry may have liked Quirrell, but he wasn\'t delusional.

It appeared that the Gryffindor trio may actually have been half-right in blaming a professor after all --- even if their mention of Voldemort now seemed foolishly far off the mark. They had just guessed the wrong professor, by the looks of it.

Harry just stayed hidden, pressed firmly up against a wall as he hoped beyond hope his cloak would ward off whatever detection spell Quirrell chose to cast.

\"Homenum Revelio.\"

Harry could... feel something. Like a wave rolling out from Quirrell, but nothing happened.

The man actually looked very surprised for all of a second before his jaw hardened.

\"Ventus Divinum.\"

What seemed to Harry like hurricane-force winds erupted from the end of Quirrell\'s wand. His cloak may have protected him from the previous spell, but it was not impervious to physical effects. It fluttered in the wind and came straight off of Harry when the boy himself was flung through the air like a carelessly discarded ragdoll.

He hit the ground hard, feeling the air leave his lungs as Quirrell dispersed his spell with a sweep of his wand.

\"Ah, Potter,\" said the professor with a gleam in his eyes. \"I had wondered whether or not I might run into you. Fate does have a funny way of meddling in the affairs of greater men.\"

\"S-sir,\" stammered Harry, doing his best to play dumb, \"what\'s---\"

\"None of that from you, Potter. You are too sharp to suddenly be ignorant and your mind is as open as a book. I know you have correctly interpreted the situation and I must say, your deductions are quite impressive, if not entirely accurate.\" The man\'s face hardened. \"Unfortunately, that only makes you all the more dangerous. You know too much and I won\'t have you be my undoing yet again. You have two choices, Potter, and I urge you to choose wisely. Join me and forever hold your tongue, or oppose me and die.\"

Harry only half heard the final bit of Quirrell\'s monologue.

\"*I won\'t have you be my undoing again.\"*

That didn\'t fit Quirinus Quirrell. Harry had never done anything to oppose him. It wouldn\'t have fit Snape, either. The man clearly didn\'t like Harry, but the Slytherin youth had never done anything to warrant such an opinion.

No, that statement would only hold true if this was one man. A man who many thought to be dead and a man whom Weasley, Granger, and Longbottom had seriously considered as a legitimate suspect.

\"Voldemort,\" Harry breathed out in little more than a hissing whisper, his throat constricting as his heart beat faster and faster.

\"In a sense,\" the Dark Lord mused, all urgency seemingly forgotten as he fixated on the boy who had held his quiet interest for the better part of the year. \"I am far from what I once was, thanks to you. Do you see what you have done to me, Harry? For years, I have been little more than a vengeful spirit hoping beyond hope he might one day find a way back to the glory he once basked in. Even now, so close I am to what I have sought for so long, I must poach off the bodies of lesser men and drink the blood of unicorns simply to keep this body from failing.\"

The Dark Lord\'s eyes were practically boring a hole in Harry now as if trying to memorize every detail. For his part, the youth in question was frozen and unable to move from fear. His limbs felt as though the blood within them had been frozen solid and they now weighed a hundred pounds each.

\"But that all ends tonight,\" hissed Voldemort. \"I will have my own body once more when the elixir of life is mine and for that to happen, I need only to escape this castle with the stone in hand.\"

He looked positively demented and even whilst in another\'s body, Harry had no difficulty envisioning this man as a mass-murdering psychopath simply from the look on his vessel\'s face alone.

\"But... how?\" he breathed. \"Your power was supposed to be broken.\"

\"Oh, it was, but the greatest among us always find a way. Those who have pushed the boundaries of magic further than any other aren\'t bound by the same restraints as the mere mortals cowering around them.

\"But you are different,\" Voldemort purred. \"I have seen it in you this year. You remind me more of myself than any child I have ever met. Potential the likes of which have not been seen since my departure from this castle and a beautiful inner darkness that can be honed into so many wonderful things.\"

\"Potential... inner darkness?\"

Voldemort ignored him. \"You don\'t need to suffer the fate of those foolish enough to oppose me, Harry. You can be greater than them, but only alongside me will you fulfil your true potential. Do not waste it by throwing your life away so carelessly. Not after your parents gave their lives for you. Do not repay them with a deluded sense of morality that will only see their sacrifice be for not.\"

\"You... want me to join you?\"

\"I do... very, very much.\"

\"Even after you killed my parents?\"

Quirrell\'s face tightened. \"It was a necessary evil. I take no pleasure in ripping families apart. Especially not when spilling pure, magical blood like that of your father. I will not apologize for what I have done. You do not deserve to be lied to by your parents\' murderer, but I will apologize for all of the hardships my actions have caused you. Allow me to atone for those evils by giving you things you could never have without me.\"

\"What things?\" By now, Harry was grasping at anything that might keep the Dark Lord talking.

\"Standing alongside me, you could help forge the world anew. You could tear down the corrupt system that would have seen your mother relegated to little more than a mere housewife. And the muggles... I know you have no love for them. Surely, you see the threat that they pose after having lived under their mercy for so long? You have seen their evil, seen how they live in constant conflict, and seen how they destroy anything they fail to understand? You must see the threat they pose if the Statute of Secrecy was ever to fall?\"

\"But it hasn\'t,\" countered Harry. \"The Statute has been strong for three---\"

\"Lies! That is nothing more than perpetuated propaganda. The Statute of Secrecy is weak and it has nearly crumbled on a number of occasions. Both world wars saw it come scarily close, and Gellert Grindelwald nearly tore it down single-handedly more than once.

\"There have been others, too. The French Revolution had its worrying moments and it has come so close to collapsing in America that wizards are forbidden from associating with muggles of any sort.\"

This was... a revelation for Harry.

He had no love for muggles, as Voldemort had correctly assumed. He had seen their cruelty first hand and he knew all too well that the Dark Lord spoke the truth.

One thing in particular that Voldemort had said hit home with Harry.

How they destroy anything they fail to understand.

That had been the crux of the matter, hadn\'t it?

Nobody had understood him, and thus everyone had lashed out against him. The Dursleys had been the worst, but they hadn\'t been the only ones and it could be argued that, if others had spent as much time with him as his wayward relatives, they might have done just as much damage.

The Dursleys were not exceptions, from what Harry had seen. They might have been the worst he had witnessed, but no muggle had ever treated him with anything resembling kindness. The other kids had labelled him a freak and his teachers had been neglectful and only helped feed into the Dursleys\' abuse. The child services had failed as had every other system ever put in place by muggles.

All because they failed to understand.

And wouldn\'t that be the case for each and every wizard from what Harry had seen? What would happen if Voldemort was right and the Statute of Secrecy really did fall? The muggles would surely wage war on the wizards and though the magicals were, of course, superior in every way imaginable, there would surely be massive amounts of death and destruction on both sides. It would probably be more devastating than either world war and the effects of those were still being felt all across the globe today.

All of these thoughts formed solidly in Harry\'s mind for the first time and now, he saw the world in an entirely different light. Just like that, his entire worldview had shifted and now he stood, dazed, confused, and frozen before this man who had destroyed so much.

But had he been acting for a noble cause?

Did that excuse his actions? Did it excuse the horrible truth that he had murdered Harry\'s parents and sent his life into a downward spiral that he was only now just beginning to recover from? And what of his parents? What had they believed? Did it even matter? Could Harry possibly side with their murderer even if he agreed with the man\'s ideologies?

He had become so lost in thought he only now heard the frantic pounding of footsteps racing towards them down an adjacent corridor. He could practically feel the magic in the air as they drew closer.

\"Your time is up,\" snarled Voldemort, looking worried for the first time. \"Choose!\"

\"I... I...\"

Voldemort slashed his wand towards Harry. There was clear regret on his face, but there was also something animalistic in those eyes.

Harry dove to the side and managed to avoid the spell, but he landed quite painfully on his wrist.

Voldemort made to sprint from the corridor, but he was too late.

\"A pleasure seeing you tonight, Quirinus.\"

Harry recognized the voice and he wasn\'t sure how to feel about its arrival, likely because he now wasn\'t sure how to feel about the man who had just attacked him.

\"Dumbledore.\" Quirrell\'s voice escaped in a hiss, but it didn\'t sound fearful. Just unbelievably hateful.

\"That is my name, yes,\" Dumbledore spoke calmly and politely, but there was the unmistakable undertone of steel. \"I must admit, I find myself less confident that Quirinus is the name most appropriate for you. Can I assume that in a warped sort of way, the brilliant young Slytherin I taught all those years ago really did get the Defence Against the Dark Arts job he once claimed to want after all these years?\"

\"I tire of your games, old man. Step aside, allow me to pass, and nobody needs to die.\"

\"I\'m not sure you are in the position to make threats. You most certainly are not at full power in your current form, else you would never have sought Nicholas\'s stone in the first place. I\'m also not sure it would be wise for you to cast the Killing Curse in such a form. Least of all when your unsteady balance has been so reliant on unicorn blood as it is.\"

\"I don\'t need that curse to kill.\" When Dumbledore didn\'t budge, Quirrell\'s lips twisted up in a terrible smile. \"You always were a stubborn old fool, but your weaknesses have always been as glaring as the hideous robes you enjoy so much.\"

Voldemort twitched Quirrell\'s wand and Neville was thrust between himself and Dumbledore. The boy inverted so that he was upside down and very slowly, his head began to bend backwards.

\"Enough,\" said Dumbledore, and Voldemort stopped. Neville\'s head was positioned at a horrible angle, but his neck had not yet broken. Any with eyes could see, however, that another couple of centimetres would do it.

\"I am going to count down from five,\" said Voldemort, speaking in much the same way he might use if discussing the day\'s weather. \"If you do not step aside by the time I am done counting, this boy will die faster than you could possibly hope to prevent it.\"

\"If I agree, you will leave him---\"

\"That isn\'t how this works, old man; you\'re losing your touch. I will be taking him with me to the gates of this castle. All the while, I will be waiting. If I sense so much as a bead of magic form on the tip of your wand, this boy will die as quickly as he would have had you simply failed to stand aside. When I reach the point from which I can apparate away, I will leave the boy for you to retrieve.\"

Quirrell\'s eyes were dancing with mirth as the monster who occupied his body smirked cruelly at Dumbledore. \"What\'s wrong, Dumbledore? Is your convoluted game of chess not as fun when you\'re playing a fellow grandmaster? Surely by now, you\'ve learned that to win the game, you need to sacrifice some pawns?\" Dumbledore didn\'t answer and Voldemort smirked before becoming much more businesslike. \"My patience has thinned; your move, old man.\"

The pain in Harry\'s head --- which he now realized was somehow emanating from his scar, of all places --- had reached a fever pitch so intense he thought he might vomit.

But even through the pain, one thing was glaringly clear.

This was wrong.

He agreed with Voldemort that the muggles were a real threat. This was a startling revelation he had come to over the past number of minutes, but he couldn\'t support the death of an innocent child. Perhaps it was because he was young and naive, and perhaps he would grow out of it in time.

For now, though, it reminded him far too much of the way he had suffered. Nothing more than collateral damage in a bigger game. It was like the Dark Lord said. He had been a pawn Voldemort was willing to sacrifice.

He didn\'t want that to happen to Neville.

It wasn\'t even so much choosing Dumbledore\'s side as it was choosing to not allow one of the few things Harry held as evil from taking place.

Slowly, he began to crawl towards the Dark Lord.

\"Very well,\" said Dumbledore, sounding as though he had just swallowed a poisonous lemon. \"You may go.\"

Voldemort used Quirrell\'s face to grin in a way that spoke of a long-awaited victory as he marched forward with the air of a prince who was about to ascend to the throne he had sought for so long.

Until a small form belonging to a young, bespectacled boy launched itself forward and tackled him around the middle, sending them both sprawling.

Harry really had thought he was helping. He thought that by catching the Dark Lord by surprise, he might save his hostage\'s life.

What he failed to account for was that Voldemort could react much faster than other men.

When he made impact with Quirrell\'s body, something horrible sounded out from in front of them. It was as if a child had become bored playing with the delicate branch of a tree and chosen to snap it, but so much worse.

The sound echoed through the corridor, seeming to reverberate in impossible ways, speaking of the death and implications it brought with it.

Harry wasn\'t entirely sure how he would have reacted if rational thought was possible, but it was most certainly not. Even in the best of situations, he was reasonably sure that he would have fallen into shock.

On this occasion, he didn\'t even do that, for his head exploded with unadulterated agony.

Harry hadn\'t thought the pain in his head could get worse, but by Merlin it had.

When he touched Quirrell, his very scar seemed to explode, releasing years of pent-up agony and torture which all rolled over Harry at once.

Years later, Harry would vehemently claim the pain he felt in that corridor was far worse than the Cruciatus Curse, but he somehow soldiered on.

Voldemort --- whose wand had been knocked from his hand --- had reached for Harry\'s throat only to scream a high, terrible scream. The skin on his hand began to sizzle and burn away, revealing the very bone underneath.

And that\'s when Harry knew that Voldemort couldn\'t touch him.

Harry wasn\'t even really sure why he was still fighting. He supposed it was just a natural feeling of paranoia, now. Voldemort had gone for his throat. Any time someone had done that in the past, it had ended badly.

So Harry went for a vital point of his own.

He buried his fingers so deep into Quirinus Quirrell\'s eyes that they embedded themselves knuckle deep in the man\'s eye sockets, tearing through Quirrell\'s eyes as if they were no more than styrofoam.

The pain was too much for both of them.

Harry and Voldemort both gave one final scream of united agony before, almost in unison, their bodies slumped, unmoving, to the floor, leaving everyone in the corridor but the wizened headmaster lying motionless.

**Chapter 13: An Unexpected Detour**

***June 8, 1992***

***The Hospital Wing***

***2:24 PM***

When Harry finally awoke from many long and torturous dreams, the first sensation he felt was a burning pain behind his eyes. Probably because after so long without light, the copious amounts of it that flowed into his eyes was jarring to say the very least. Without his glasses on, the sensation was even worse as he could make out nothing around him but a bright blur closing in on all sides.

He wasn\'t sure how his glasses found their way into his hand, but they did, so he put them on; at which point he finally became aware of his surroundings --- though he was still blinking furiously from the onslaught of sudden light.

He was in an unfamiliar room with white walls and ceiling. Harry couldn\'t make out much of it, since he seemed to be isolated from most of the room. He was lying on a white, well-made bed, but there were curtains of the same colour all around him, closing him and his bed in on all sides.

\"Good afternoon, Harry.\"

Harry almost jumped at the voice. He did jolt, but he quickly slumped back down against his pillows when it sent a horrible stab of pain through his head.

\"Do be careful,\" the voice said. \"I would hate to be thrown out of my own hospital wing by an angry matron due to injuries you suffered on my account.\"

\"Professor Dumbledore?\" Harry asked, recognizing the voice from the few times he had heard it before.

He glanced towards it. Dumbledore was indeed there, sitting in an armchair that looked remarkably out of place. Somehow, Harry had a feeling the Hogwarts Headmaster had conjured it himself.

\"It is good to see you awake at last,\" the man said, and Harry couldn\'t help but notice how old and weary he appeared. He hadn\'t looked this way when they had spoken in front of the Mirror of Erised. Not even in that conversation\'s darkest moments.

Harry thought back to the last time he had been conscious. It was all really quite fuzzy and it took him at least a minute to begin putting the pieces together.

When he did, dread filled his stomach as something horrid ripped at his heart, trying to tear the strings like a vengeful child taking out their frustrations on an old, weathered guitar.

\"Neville,\" said Harry, voice breaking. \"Is he... I remember---\"

\"It is likely that you remember correctly.\" Dumbledore\'s voice was completely flat, which affirmed to Harry more than anything else that he did indeed have a clear memory of the events. \"I am sorry, Harry. I know you did your best to prevent that very thing from happening, and what took place on that night is nothing a child of your age should ever see.\"

\"It was my fault,\" Harry whispered. \"He said that if you attacked him, he would kill L-Neville. I... I thought he was only focusing on magic. I thought... I thought---\"

\"That if you surprised him with a physical assault, you might break the control he had over young Neville and create an opening for me to intervene?\" Harry nodded morosely.

Dumbledore sighed. \"First and foremost, I must dissuade you of any notions that this is in any way your fault. You did what you thought was best. It is true that it wasn\'t the most well thought out course of action I have ever seen, but such things are perfectly reasonable. You are still so very young, much as I know you hate to hear that. I said before that no child your age should ever see such things. Things like that... well, they make well-trained adults panic and do things that are not always wise. What you did was not the most appropriate thing in the moment, but it was perfectly reasonable given the context of such events. It would have been ridiculous to have expected anything different from you.\"

\"I still shouldn\'t have done it,\" whispered Harry. \"He said exactly what would happen if someone attacked him and I just ignored it.\"

\"You did not ignore it,\" Dumbledore said kindly. \"If you had ignored it, you would not have acted the way you did. You would not have realized the precarious position I myself was in, so it is likely you would have allowed me to react.\"

\"I don\'t want it to ever happen again.\" Harry\'s voice shook and though he hated the fact, he could do nothing to stop it.

\"Let us hope you are never again in a situation like the one you found yourself in that night.\"

\"But that isn\'t good enough,\" Harry argued. \"What if I am? What happens then? I... I don\'t want to panic again. It... it scares me. Making mistakes like that... Neville is dead because of it.\"

\"You think too singularly,\" said Dumbledore. \"There is no one reason Neville Longbottom is dead. Did your attacking the vessel of Lord Voldemort have an impact? Of course it did. Did a great many other things have an equal or greater impact? Yes, they did.\"

\"What other things?\"

Dumbledore didn\'t answer at once. \"Where to begin?\" he said at last. \"I could really start with all of the things that made Lord Voldemort the monster he is today, but I will not bore you with such things. Not unless it one day becomes necessary. Instead, I will go back to the final day of October in 1981. The very second Voldemort\'s power was broken, it was inevitable he would one day seek to return. It is not in his nature to accept failure and so long as even a part of him survives, he will always seek to return by any means necessary.\" Dumbledore\'s face suddenly scrunched up. \"And then, of course, there are my own mistakes to account for.\"

\"Your mistakes, sir?\"

\"Oh yes, Harry, and what a great number of them there are. You see, if there is any one person who should be blamed for the death of Neville Longbottom, you are looking at him.\"

\"I... don\'t understand.\"

\"No, I\'m sure you don\'t.\" Dumbledore took a minute to ponder his next reply. \"You remember the analogy that was made in that corridor about chess?\" Hesitantly, Harry nodded. \"It was... more apt than I would like it to be. I\'m afraid that when dealing with this particular situation, I tried to play so many moves ahead that it cost others dearly in the short term.\"

\"I\'m... missing some bits.\"

\"Hm? Ah yes, I suppose you are. You of course know that Lord Voldemort was after the Philosopher\'s Stone?\" Harry nodded. \"Did you also happen to know that the stone was created by one named Nicholas Flamel?\"

Harry shook his head but scrunched up his face. \"I\'ve... heard that name before.\"

\"I\'m sure you have. He is quite famous. I myself worked with Nicholas on alchemy for many years.\"

\"That\'s it,\" breathed Harry. \"He\'s on your chocolate frog card.\"

Dumbledore actually chuckled despite the mood. \"He is, yes. An interesting introduction to a most intriguing man. Nicholas is a man of many great achievements, but by far his greatest is the creation of the Philosopher\'s Stone.\"

\"So... he asked you to keep it, or something?\"

\"In essence, yes. Nicholas became worried for the stone not long before the school year was set to begin. You see, there was an attack on his property in France and it was deemed by both him and myself as too well-orchestrated to be the work of any but a most skilled practitioner of the darkest of arts.\"

\"So you moved it to Hogwarts?\"

\"It was much more complicated than that, but yes. It was first sent to Gringotts while I ensured certain protections were in place at the castle. Other things were considered, too. The Fidelius Charm was taken under strong consideration, but I dismissed it. Nicholas has participated in the charm\'s casting as many times as a person can and I confess, I wanted to save my available usages of it for a later date.

\"So, I decided it would be best for the stone to be hidden at Hogwarts.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"I had my suspicions even then that it was Voldemort who was after the stone. I was sure the protections I had set forth at Hogwarts were infallible and that he would not be able to pass them. Not through all of them, at least.\"

\"You were sure you could keep Vol-sorry. You-Know---\"

\"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.\"

\"Yes, sir. You... really thought you could keep Voldemort away from the stone?\"

\"I did, yes. If you will forgive my saying, some of the traps really were quite ingenious. Professor Snape had a most compelling puzzle, but I will admit, I was most fond of my two additions.\"

Harry felt an odd sense of curiosity. He was sure he wouldn\'t understand them now, but he wondered exactly what kind of protections the greatest wizard since Merlin would have come up with. He already hadn\'t understood one bit of the conversation --- something about a Fidelity Charm, or something --- but he was interested nonetheless.

\"Can... can I ask what your ideas were, sir?\"

\"Certainly. Between the two of us, a man like myself does grow bored of having his own genius stroked. In saying that, it is nice to explain one\'s thoughts to others from time to time.

\"If you pushed past that door and stepped into the corridor, you would come face-to-face with a cerberus.\" Dumbledore studied Harry. \"Do you know what makes that specific beast so deadly?\"

Harry shook his head. \"The only thing I know about them is that in muggle myths, they have three heads.\"

Dumbledore\'s lips twitched. \"They do indeed have three heads, but there is far more to it than that. You see, a cerberus is a very unique and powerful creature. Every single one of them is different. They cannot be killed nor even severely harmed by almost any magic we know of. Why, even the spell that took your parents away from us would be completely ineffective against a cerberus --- though many don\'t realize this.\"

Harry looked surprised. \"So they\'re invincible? How did Voldemort get past it then?\"

\"Ah, no, they are not invincible. Magic is, at its core, all about balance. The cerberus cannot be harmed by almost any magic so long as and only if they are protecting something, but they all have a weakness. It is different for each beast. No two cerberuses will have the same weakness, but they all have one. For Fluffy --- Hagrid\'s beast and the one who guarded the stone --- that was music. Play even a somewhat competent attempt at a tune and the beast would be asleep in seconds. Where magic comes in and balances these beasts is one of the things I find most fascinating. You see, if you have something valuable to protect, a cerberus will never be loyal to you. It is truly an interesting dichotomy. A creature that is tailor-made to protect will never be loyal to any who has something that is in need of protecting.\"

\"But it worked here because Hagrid didn\'t need the stone protected, Flamel did?\"

\"Precisely.\" There was an odd twinkle in Dumbledore\'s eyes as he spoke.

\"And the other protection?\"

\"That one will take much less explaining. I told you back months ago that the Mirror of Erised would be relocated, do you remember?\" Harry nodded; he was unlikely to ever forget anything about that mirror. \"Well, it was relocated and served as the final obstacle protecting the Philosopher\'s Stone. Above even the cerberus, this protection was why I was so sure Voldemort would be unable to get his hands on the stone.\"

\"Why\'s that, sir?\"

\"Think about how the mirror works, Harry, and now imagine for a moment that I have placed the stone within the mirror. I did some... tweaking of the artifact\'s enchantments and by the time I was done, it would have been impossible for Voldemort to remove the stone. You see, only those who did not want to possess the stone for any selfish reason could have looked into that mirror and had the stone given to them.\" His expression darkened. \"I did not, unfortunately, account for the possibility that students might go looking for it and that Voldemort might use one of them to remove the stone for him.

\"Do you see my mistake, Harry? I was so focused on combating the genius of Lord Voldemort that I forgot to account for the spontaneity of circumstance. It is a mistake I should not have made after so much time on this earth, but alas, I am the furthest thing from perfect.\"

\"You could never have known though,\" defended Harry.

\"True,\" said Dumbledore, \"just as you could never have been expected to react differently than how you did.\" There was a long, awkward pause.

\"I believe we have come to an impasse,\" Dumbledore continued. \"Let us cease this foolish game of trying to assign a force so arbitrary as that of blame. I am sure you have questions after the ordeal you went through.\" Harry nodded with a considerable amount of reluctance. He had never exactly been encouraged to ask questions by adults before. \"Ask away then, dear boy, and I shall answer; for I believe you have the right to know a great many things. Particularly in the wake of Master Longbottom\'s tragic and untimely passing.\"

\"What... what\'s going to happen with Neville\'s family? What will his parents do?\"

Harry wasn\'t sure why, but he immediately knew that he had said something wrong. Or at the very least, something that spoke of far deeper implications than he realized.

\"Nothing will change for Neville\'s parents.\" Dumbledore\'s voice was suddenly as hard as steel. Harry had never heard him like this; not even while confronting Voldemort.

\"Are-are they dead?\"

\"No, death would be far preferable to what Frank and Alice Longbottom went through.\" When Harry only looked at the Headmaster with wide, curious eyes, the man relented with obvious reluctance. \"Neville\'s parents were aurors --- they\'re something like the wizarding police, but they are a force consisting of the best of the best. They were very good ones, too. They defied Voldemort directly on multiple occasions and lived to tell the tale.\"

His expression darkened. \"Unfortunately, this painted a target on their back. In the days following your defeat of Voldemort, many of his followers grew restless in their search for their fallen master. Some of the worst of them attacked Neville\'s family, obviously hoping they had information as to where their master might be. Neither of them did, but their attackers cared not. They were both tortured into insanity and currently reside in a very specific ward in the magical hospital of Saint Mungoes. A ward for those whose minds have been torn so asunder by magic that they are not fit to live in our society anymore. Those in this ward have no hope of ever recovering.\"

\"Does... *did* he have any family?\"

\"His grandmother, yes. I have spoken with her already. It... was not an easy discussion to have.\"

\"Does she know what happened?\"

\"She does not.\" Dumbledore pierced Harry with his blue-eyed stare. \"The public does not know that Lord Voldemort survived that night. Many of them believe him dead and some are better for it. If it ever became public knowledge that he had not died that night, people might rally around him once more. At the very least, panic would sweep across the nation and do irrevocable damage. I know you must not understand, but the fear felt when Voldemort was at the height of his powers was unlike anything these isles have ever seen. It is imperative the secret of his survival stays between the two of us. I will not bind you to this secret by any means I know, but I will ask you, man to man, whether or not I can trust you to keep this secret?\"

Harry hesitated for only a second. He loved this new world far too much to see it fall into complete and total disarray. \"Yes, sir; you can trust me.\"

\"Very good. Now, I\'m sure you have more questions?\"

\"Voldemort still hasn\'t really gone then, is he? He\'ll try to come back again, won\'t he?\"

\"No, Harry, he has not gone. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to take over... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. I would say he left Quirrell to die, but there was none of him left. You never knew Quirinus Quirrell. You know only Voldemort, for it was merely Quirinus\'s corpse under that monster\'s complete and total control. He was weakened greatly by this form, but it was better than death, and so what if it cost an innocent man his life?

\"Lord Voldemort shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time --- and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.\"

\"How... what happened when I tackled him? His skin, it... it burnt.\"

\"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\'t realize that love as powerful as your mother\'s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Voldemort, full of hatred, greed, and ambition could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\"

\"Voldemort will just try and use the stone again, won\'t he?\"

Dumbledore suddenly became very interested in a bird on the windowsill outside. \"That isn\'t something we will need to worry about in the future, no.\"

Harry blinked. \"What?\"

\"Nicholas and I have had a chat about this very subject, and we both thought it best for the stone to be destroyed.\"

\"Destroyed?\" Harry asked, incredulous. \"But... that means... he\'ll die, right?\"

\"They have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.\"

Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry\'s face. \"To one as young as you, I\'m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicholas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all --- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\"

\"Sir?\" asked Harry, trying to stall for time whilst he worked out how to phrase a... riskier question. \"How long was I unconscious?\"

\"A little over three days, I\'m afraid. Your friends have been quite worried. You will no doubt have noticed the tokens of worry and friendship they have sent you.\" He gestured to piles of sweets and other confections lying around the room that Harry had failed to notice up to that point.

That gave him another idea for a question to ask while he tried to put his thoughts into safer words. This one really was something he did want answered.

\"Sir... what\'s going to happen to Hagrid?\"

\"I wish I could be sure myself. He will stand on trial at some point in July. The Wizengamot will decide his fate, and I can only hope they will be merciful.\"

Finally, Harry felt comfortable in attempting to phrase this next question.

During the confrontation, he had wondered about his parents. He had wondered about their ideologies and how they compared to Voldemort\'s. He had wondered how it was they had differed and now, he wondered what they would think of Harry\'s inherent distrust of muggles. A distrust that Voldemort had effectively cast into sharp relief during their short but enlightening --- if terrifying --- discussion.

\"Sir... why did Voldemort attack me and my parents?\"

\"What is it that inspires this line of questioning, if you do not, of course, mind my asking?\"

\"Just... some things Voldemort said.\"

\"I see.\" There was a pause of a few seconds during which Dumbledore seemed to be considering something. \"I should not tell you,\" he said. \"You are far too young for such truths, but you are also far too young to have seen what you have already seen. I will not tell you today, but I will make a bargain with you.

\"Starting at the beginning of next year, I will teach you --- if you are willing, of course --- to protect your mind. Once I am satisfied with the progress you have made on that front, I will give you an overview. I will state from the onset the details will not be revealed to you until you are older. There are things it\'s really best you don\'t know just yet, but I will at least answer your question in general terms. Is this agreeable to you?\"

It wasn\'t the answer Harry was hoping for, since it really didn\'t answer his question at all. If Dumbledore was only going to give a vague idea, it might not answer his question in the long run, either.

But something the man had said had piqued Harry\'s interest. \"Defend my mind, sir?\"

\"Indeed.\" Dumbledore studied him closely. \"There is a branch of magic known to men like Voldemort that allows them to manipulate the minds of others. I will not explain such things here, but I think with the threat of Voldemort reemerging once more, it is important for you especially to learn this fine art.\" His eyes began to twinkle once more. \"It also provides a number of other benefits that are most useful if properly applied. I will warn you though, these benefits are nastily tricky to learn.\"

The choice was a foregone conclusion. Just like when Theodore had told him about obliviators, Harry\'s imagination ran through all the horrid things he didn\'t want somebody to be able to do to his mind. If there was a defence of any kind, he would be learning it.

\"I\'ll learn it, sir.\"

\"Excellent!\" Dumbledore glanced at a clock on the wall. \"I do believe I have overstayed my welcome, unless you have any final questions?\"

\"Um... a couple?\"

\"Ask away, then.\"

\"Do you know who sent me the invisibility cloak?\"

\"Ah --- your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it. They are such useful things... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\"

\"And there\'s something else...\"

\"Fire away.\"

\"Can I stay at Hogwarts over the summer holidays?\"

Dumbledore\'s face fell. \"I am afraid not, Harry. Much as I do not believe them to have treated you with the kindness you deserve, the Dursleys are your family. Perhaps that is another mistake I have made over the years. I was the one who allowed them to obtain guardianship over you in the first place. I can only say that at the time, I had genuinely believed they would treat you with the utmost kindness. Alas, the deed is done and undoing it would be a great deal of trouble for all involved. Yet no matter what, you are safe there; more safe than anywhere else in the world. Powerful magics are in place on that home. Magics that draw directly from the power of your mother\'s sacrifice. So long as you reside there, no outsider who means you harm can lay so much as a finger on you.\"

Harry had to try hard not to let the anger, bitterness, and frustration show on his face. So it had been Dumbledore who had gotten him stuck there. \"I understand, sir,\" he said in a bland voice that came out a touch cooler than intended.

If Dumbledore noticed, he made no comment. \"Very good. Now, how about you begin on the mountain of sweets your friends have left for you, hm?\" He reached out and picked up a package of Bettie Botts Every Flavour Beans. \"Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit-flavoured one, and since then I\'m afraid I\'ve rather lost my liking for them --- but I think I\'ll be safe with a nice toffee, don\'t you?\"

He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, \"Alas! Earwax!\"

***June 19, 1992***

***The Great Hall***

***1:00 PM***

It had been nearly two days before Harry had been allowed out of the hospital wing. He had lightly protested, but he actually hadn\'t minded that much. His books had been brought to him so he could at least read. Not for too long, or his head would begin to ache --- but it was a nice distraction. More than anything though, he had wanted to spend time alone.

He needed time to process all that had happened. The revelation that Voldemort had not only survived but was threatening a return, the death of a fellow student despite his intervention, and all the other things that had transpired since his last bout of consciousness.

That wasn\'t to say he was alone.

His friends were allowed to visit him the day after he awoke. Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy, and Theodore poured in alongside Diana, Cassius, and the rest of their friends.

There had been an awkward moment during which Harry and Draco had stared intently at one another before the blond finally broke.

\"I was an idiot, all right? I should have never done it. You told me not to and I gave you my word. I\'m not sorry I did it, but I\'m sorry I did it without telling you. I should have at least been honest and said what I was doing. I\'m sorry, Harry. I hope we can be friends again and that I can earn back your trust. I promise, I won\'t lie to you again.\"

Slowly, Harry nodded.

Things had been tense between Harry and Draco for the next few days, but they had mostly smoothed over. Harry didn\'t trust Draco nearly as much as he had before the incident, but then again, he wasn\'t sure he trusted *anyone* nearly as much as he once had. This year had left a deep and lasting impression on him. Draco was just more directly under his line of scrutiny than most because of what had already transpired between them.

The day before the train was set to bring them all back to London, the leaving feast was held in the Great Hall.

When they entered, it was clear there was more at play and Harry had very little doubt of what that was.

The hall was decorated in Gryffindor colours despite Slytherin\'s House Cup victory. The decorations were muted though. Dark, tasteful reds as opposed to vivid scarlets. Any gold that was used was done so very sparingly.

The school had of course been made aware of Neville\'s passing, if not the specific details that had accompanied it. As always, the Hogwarts rumour mill had been running roughshod. Most had linked his death to Quirrell\'s sudden disappearance. Some had even gone as far as to group Harry in somehow since he had spent a number of days in the hospital wing directly after the fact.

The mood of the school had been heavy, though there had been a brief break in that mood when --- on the back of their captain, Oliver Wood, and their star seeker, Ron Weasley --- Gryffindor captured their first Quidditch Cup in seven years. Weasley had, according to some, almost not been medically cleared to play, but he had persevered and beaten the young Ravenclaw seeker to the snitch.

It had served as an apt tribute to Gryffindor\'s fallen hero, though the mood in the hall was heavy in spite of that.

The hall was deathly silent even before Dumbledore took to his feet at the staff table, but he still waited a moment before speaking.

\"Another year gone,\" he began. \"Though this was no ordinary year. As you will all by now be aware, we lost one of our own in the closing weeks of this otherwise magical year.\" His eyes roamed the hall and fell on the Gryffindor table, where there were plenty of muted expressions and downcast faces.

\"Neville Longbottom was a boy who personified everything it means to be a Gryffindor. Godric himself would have felt great pride at having young Neville in his house. This was not publicised at the time, but I think it only right now to give the son of Franklin and Alice his credit for he, like them, was a hero.

\"It was Neville who disposed of the troll on Halloween when it invaded our castle.\" Muttering erupted through the Great Hall at this, ranging from awed to disbelieving. \"He did so at great personal risk and with the safety of his friends in mind. He was undoubtedly brave and stunningly kind. He put his friends before himself until the very end. He chose to do what was right instead of what was easy and for that, he will be fondly remembered by all.

\"In dark times like these, I think it only prudent we learn all we can, for it is best to make light of any and all situations. Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, so long as one remembers to follow the light. Whether you knew Neville or not, I urge all of you to take the time and effort to hold each other up. Use this as an opportunity to unite together and grow stronger. Do not allow his loss to weaken your resolve or your friendships; it is the opposite of what a boy like Neville would have wanted.

\"Before we move onto the awarding of the House Cup, I think it only right we stand and take a moment of silence for a boy who was good, kind, and brave.\" All in the hall stood, glasses in hand as they followed the lead of their Headmaster. \"To Neville Longbottom,\" Dumbledore thundered, and the students chorused back. Even the Slytherins chanted along, and Harry did not see even a single person sitting down.

\"Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six, and Slytherin have four hundred and seventy-two.\"

A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Had it not been for the mood befallen on Harry by the rousing speech about Neville, he would have joined Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle in banging their goblets against the table whilst the rest of the house stomped and cheered.

\"Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent events must be taken into account.\"

The room went very still and the Slytherins\' smiles faded a little.

\"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes... First --- to Master Ronald Weasley, for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"

Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to shake quiver. From across the hall, Harry could see Ron Weasley\'s multitude of brothers dogpiling on top of him as if he had just won them the Quidditch Cup for a second time that month.

\"Idiots,\" hissed Draco. \"It\'s not like those points matter.\"

Dumbledore cleared his throat and the hall fell silent once again. \"Second --- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"

Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves --- they were a hundred points up, even if they were still sixty points behind Slytherin.

\"Third --- to Master Harry Potter...\" said Dumbledore. The room went deathly quiet as the Slytherins\' ears perked up. \"For pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Slytherin house sixty points.\"

The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Slytherin now had five hundred and thirty-two points --- once more ahead of the lions by over a hundred points.

A hundred and twenty, to be exact.

Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.

\"To Master Neville Longbottom, for the ultimate form of bravery that can never be measured and will never be forgotten, I award Gryffindor house one hundred and twenty-five points.\"

Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table.

Slytherins up and down were cursing at the top of their lungs, but Harry could hear none of them over the eruption of noise from the other three tables. He felt the pang of anger in his stomach like the rest of his house, but he found himself not nearly as upset as his companions.

He knew all too well what Neville had sacrificed trying to stop Voldemort. Even if he still wasn\'t sure what he thought of the objective, that kind of bravery deserved far more than a house championship trophy. Losing the House Cup stung and Harry did feel quite cheated, but he could at least understand why Dumbledore had done it --- even if he may not have liked the decision.

\"Which means,\" Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we need no change of decoration.\"

And so the feast itself began.

When it finished sometime later, many of the Slytherins were muttering harshly as they exited the hall. Harry stayed quiet, not so much as looking up until a hand rested on his shoulder.

\"Headmaster?\"

\"I do apologize for the loss in the standings,\" said Dumbledore. \"You really did deserve more points than I awarded you, but I thought a Gryffindor victory more... thematically appropriate.\"

Harry\'s expression didn\'t change. \"I understand, sir.\"

\"Very good. I do hope you enjoy your summer.\"

***June 20, 1992***

***The Hogwarts Express***

***11:23 AM***

It had been a rough few weeks for Ron and Hermione, who now sat alone in a compartment on the Hogwarts Express as the train raced back towards London.

Losing Neville had been very hard on the both of them. Ron was quite popular, especially after the win he had secured Gryffindor in the Quidditch final, but most of the people who followed him around didn\'t really captivate his attention. He enjoyed the attention and happily basked in it, but he wouldn\'t really call any of those people friends.

Hermione didn\'t have many, either. Her bookish nature turned most people off of her, so she treasured the few friends she did have.

Neville had defined what it had meant to be a friend. The boy had begun to come out of his shell as the year had drawn on, and both Ron and Hermione had been glad for it. He was the kindest of all of them and Hermione couldn\'t help but remember the way he had stood between her and the figure in the forest, or the resolute expression he had worn before they departed for the final time down in the catacombs on that fateful night.

Even now, more than two weeks later, both of them were sombre as the train departed from Hogsmeade Station. They didn\'t speak for twenty long minutes.

Not until a knock came from the door and it opened to reveal a tall, handsome boy the two of them recognized as a Hufflepuff. Two younger girls followed in his wake. One had blonde pigtails whilst the other had dark red hair pulled back in a loose ponytail.

\"Hi,\" said the older boy, who was clearly the ringleader. \"Can we sit here?\"

Ron and Hermione exchanged glances before hesitantly nodding.

\"Thank you,\" said the boy, levitating all of their trunks up and into the overhead compartment with well-practised precision. \"I\'m sorry for your loss; I know you two were closest with Neville. I didn\'t know him well, but he was always kind to me and he was a great model of exactly what Gryffindor should be. I wish I could have known him, but I\'m hoping I can get to know those he called friends. If he thought you two were worth hanging around with, then I\'m sure we\'ll get along fine, if you\'ll let us.\"

He held out his hand, first to Hermione. \"I\'m Cedric Diggory. This is Hannah Abbot and Susan Bones. I hope we can become good friends in the future.\"

Ron and Hermione couldn\'t help but smile. There was just something about Cedric Diggory that spoke of a potentially happy future.

***About ten hours later...***

Harry had spent most of the train ride back to London in silence while his friends discussed a wide number of things and played games of all sorts.

He didn\'t even read; he just stared out of the window, watching the lush green fields and quaint little towns race past as they sped down the tracks for hours and hours.

There was nothing he dreaded more than returning to Privet Drive and his anxiety was higher than it had ever been before. It had only gotten worse when, before leaving the feast, they had all been given a reminder that magic was not to be performed out of school unless they were of age. Harry had known this already, but seeing the reminder in his hand really drove the point home.

He would be at the mercy of the Dursleys once more and forced to live like a common muggle for the next two and a half months.

\"Don\'t worry,\" Draco had told him. \"I\'m sure Father will get you out of that dump quickly enough. He\'ll need to confirm some things, of course, but I\'m sure he\'ll have no trouble... convincing the muggles to let you out.\"

Draco\'s words hadn\'t reassured Harry as much as the blond had likely hoped, but he was grateful for them nonetheless.

By the time the door to their compartment slid open just minutes before they were set to arrive at King\'s Cross Station, Harry\'s heart was beating unnaturally fast.

\"Your end-of-year grades,\" said Gemma, who had stepped through the door to deliver their missives. She levitated the envelopes to each of them, but her stare didn\'t leave Harry. \"Can you come with me for a moment, Potter?\"

\"Um... sure.\"

Harry stood and followed her out of the compartment, opening his envelope and peering down at the parchment within as he did so.

*Dear Master Potter,*

*Please find enclosed your end-of-year results. We thank you for your dedication this year and would like to sincerely congratulate you on all of your achievements.*

*Yours truly,*

*Minerva McGonagall*

*Deputy Headmistress*

*Passing Grades:*

*O = Outstanding.*

*E = Exceeds Expectations.*

*A = Acceptable.*

*Failing Grades:*

*P = Poor.*

*D = Dreadful.*

*T = Troll.*

*Harry James Potter Has Achieved:*

*Astronomy - A*

*Charms - O*

*Defence Against the Dark Arts - O*

*Herbology - E*

*History of Magic - O*

*Potions - E*

*Transfiguration - O*

Harry internally thanked Professor Flitwick for what must have been the hundredth time for making him see the importance of magical theory. He was gifted enough in Transfiguration and Defence Against the Dark Arts that it honestly might not have mattered. In Charms though, he would never have scored an O without the dedication to theoretical material. He was very good at Charms, but Flitwick\'s class had a *heavy* emphasis on magic\'s theoretical components.

His Astronomy grade was low, but he cared not at all for the class. As far as he could tell, its only applications were in knowing when certain potions ingredients were at their most optimal. He doubted he would ever be a master potioneer and if he somehow ever became one, he would be using a star chart anyway. He viewed the class as being useless and couldn\'t wait to drop it entirely after fifth year.

Herbology was useful, but it had never been of great interest to Harry. The same could be said for Potions. History was really just a joke. Harry spent most of the class studying magical theory while Binns droned on and on in the background. Harry had just read thoroughly through the relevant portions of the history textbook. He had actually read through much more than that since he genuinely did find the subject interesting when Binns wasn\'t teaching.

Next year, he thought, he would just stop attending History lessons and see if anyone of importance even noticed. He would still get an O; of that, he had little doubt.

Gemma cleared her throat, drawing Harry\'s attention back onto her. \"I won\'t be seeing you next year,\" she said. \"Not with me going off into the world and you going back to Hogwarts. I wanted you to know that you were a pleasure to teach and that you have the potential to be special.\" Her eyes gleamed. \"I\'m not the only one to see it, either. Other people see it in you, Harry. When you meet them, I think you should listen to what they have to say.\"

Harry wasn\'t entirely sure what she meant by that, but he nodded along anyway as Gemma removed yet another envelope from the pocket of her robes.

\"Something to remember me by.\"

Harry reached out and took the envelope, immediately feeling as though something was wrong. It seemed to... tingle under his fingertips.

\"Ziel erreicht!\"

Gemma Fawley\'s barking proclamation was the last thing Harry heard before the oddest sensation gripped him.

It was as though a hook had attached itself right underneath his navel and was pulling him forward at break-neck speeds. The world blurred around him as distorted colours and shapes raced past faster than the eye could perceive. He was spinning like a top, faster and faster as he travelled through space and time so quickly he was sure he would explode at any moment...

But he didn\'t.

Harry\'s feet slammed hard into something solid, sending him sprawling.

He didn\'t know where he was, but he knew it was not the Hogwarts Express.

The air in this place was different. Drafts of wind seemed to whistle through its halls as if the space within was open and vast. Harry glanced up but it was dark. There were no windows facing him and even if there were, it was night outside. The only light came from a scarce number of dim torches hanging in ancient-looking brackets dotted conservatively on the walls.

This place reminded Harry of a dungeon; though he had the distinct impression that, wherever he was, it was at least above ground.

Then, he saw the bodies.

There were three of them lying nearby and for a moment, he thought they had been deposited here like him.

He crawled towards the nearest one and reached out to shake his shoulder, keen on asking if any of them knew what the hell was happening.

It became immediately clear none of these men knew anything now.

When Harry got closer, the gruesome sight laid out before him made itself known. It was only all the more nightmarish by the fact the bodies were cast in shadow, and the red pools around their heads were only visible at all because they were just barely illuminated by the flickering torchlight.

Harry wanted to gag.

Not even the smell of Quirrell\'s burning flesh or the feeling of his fingers tearing through his eyes like a child\'s might rip through bubble wrap had given him this sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach. He hadn\'t eaten all day out of stress but still, the very acid of his stomach threatened to rise at the horror scene he was now a witness to.

All three bodies were prone as if asleep, but the truth was much, much worse.

Their heads had all been twisted so far their necks had not just broken, but the top of their spines had pierced their very throats. The bone could be seen jutting up and out of their skin like skewers through kebabs. One of the heads had been inverted a full one hundred and eighty degrees, and the top of his spine stuck straight up and pierced through his jaw like a morbid caricature of a tongue, exposing that bone and muscle as well.

It was like something out of a horror movie, and it made anything Voldemort had done this year at Hogwarts seem tame by comparison.

Only a monster could do something like this. It would have made Jack the Ripper proud and whoever was responsible was surely the magical equivalent of him --- or even worse.

\"We meet at last.\"

The voice came from the shadows behind Harry, where he had yet to look as he was so transfixed with horror by the scene that had greeted him.

The voice was accented. Harry was no expert but to him, it sounded vaguely German. It was soft, smooth, and amused of all things.

It was *amused* by all of this!

Harry did not stand. He couldn\'t, for he knew his shaking legs would have given out beneath him from fear, nausea, and horror.

But he did turn himself around and look into the shadows from where the voice spoke.

Between him and it was a set of bars so close together that not even a skeleton could have fit through them. It was difficult to see inside the cell, but Harry thought he could make out the vaguest outline of a bed near a window that overlooked a dark, churning body of water far below.

And there was a figure on the bed... a shadowy figure that was standing and moving towards him.

Harry tried to get to his feet, but couldn\'t. His legs gave out, just as he knew they would, and he was left to stare in transfixed terror at the man approaching him.

Just as he neared the bars, the man held out his hand and in it, light burst into being, casting his weathered face into sharp relief.

He had the look of a very handsome man who had not aged well. His face was thin and gaunt, but Harry could see where it had once doubtlessly been chiselled and youthful. The man was mostly bald, but there were a few wisps of white hair remaining, dotted haphazardly upon his skull; with skin stretched so tight that his head resembled that of a fleshless skeleton.

Except for the eyes.

His eyes shone with so much intelligence that Harry immediately knew this man had orchestrated all of it. From inside his very prison cell, he had somehow orchestrated the death of these guards and probably even Harry\'s arrival.

\"A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mister Potter, and welcome to Nurmengard,\" the man said in that smooth, accented voice, his eyes dancing with unmasked hunger. \"I am Gellert Grindelwald, and the two of us have much to discuss.\"

**TO BE CONTINUED IN**

**BOOK 2:**

**HARRY POTTER AND THE EROSION OF INNOCENCE**

**COMING OCTOBER 3RD, 2021!**

**Author\'s Endnote:**

**A note on the release date for book 2:**

**I do apologize for the delay, but I am writing the entirety of book 2 before I post a single word of it on FFN or AO3. I also hope to compete in Tokyo this summer, so that will hopefully occupy much of my time as well. With these two things to consider, I hope you will forgive the absence.**

**It will start uploading earlier than that on my Discord server. If you want to get book 2 a little bit early and haven\'t joined that yet, I would recommend doing so. There are more than 2,000 people on there to chat with while you\'re at it, and I myself am quite active.**

**For those of you reading on FFN, the link can be found on my profile. If it doesn\'t work for you the first time, try updating your browser and it should work fine. If not, you can always shoot me a PM and I can help get you sorted. If you\'re reading this on AO3, just click the Discord link in the chapter notes at the top. It should take you right there.**

**About half of book 2 is already written and is available RIGHT NOW for those who sign up to my P\*T\*E\*N page. You are under no obligation to do so, but the option is there if you want the chapters immediately. I believe there are twelve unreleased chapters up on there, at the moment.**

**Also, book 2 and all future books will be posted under this one story. They will not be posted as separate stories, so you just need to stay following this story to keep up to date on the fic.**

**Now, onto the actual chapter notes:**

**First year is a difficult one to make interesting, largely because it always seems to end in the same way. I have obviously not done that, so I hope you found the first year --- its final few chapters, in particular --- to be both unique and entertaining.**

**On the note of first year, a massive thank you to those of you who consistently review. I read each and every single one of them and they mean the world to me. A special shoutout is extended to The Tale of Fate for leaving an extremely well thought out and very insightful review on the last chapter. I would really have loved to discuss it with you, but your profile does not allow me to send messages. Just know that it has been read, considered, and appreciated.**

**Oh, and before any reviews come up about it, I promise there is an explanation for Harry being transported to Nurmengard and it is consistent with Grindelwald being unable to escape. It is explained in book 2\'s first chapter. :)**

**Speaking of shoutouts, I can take almost no credit for any of the cerberus lore. That was an idea had by my beta, Regress, and it is one of the cooler magical theory concepts I have heard in quite some time.**

**As I said, we will be diverging further and further from canon as the story progresses, so I hope you enjoyed its opening instalments.**

**My advice to those reading on is simple.**

**Expect the unexpected.**

**Please read and review.**
