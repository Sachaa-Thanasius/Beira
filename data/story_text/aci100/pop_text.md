***A Rock in the Sea***

***11:56 PM***

Perched haphazardly in the vast, churning sea, a small, barren rock lay exposed and helpless to the infinite power of the world around it. It lay bare to the elements which often sought to ravage it, as well as any who were unfortunate enough to be occupying the rock in question at that most inopportune time.

Around this small refuge, the sea stretched out as far as the eye could see, displaying its vast power by crashing forcefully against the island\'s side, as if it were trying to capsize it like a helpless canoe caught in the ruthless grasp of a vengeful current.

Situated on the rocky and remote island was a small, rickety shack. The wind brutally tore across the island, making the lone shelter shake. Between that and the surging waves occasionally crashing against the island with such force one might think it would be pulled under at any moment, it really was a wonder the shack still stood at all.

The dilapidated shack hardly gave the impression of sanctuary, and it would be apt to think someone criminally insane for going anywhere near it, let alone seeking refuge within the structure that seemed poised to fall at any moment.

The last people one would ever expect to see in such a structure were a rather well-off family who prided themselves on being perfectly normal. They were, in their opinion, the very pinnacle of what the sophisticated section of Britain\'s upper-middle-class should look like.

Oh, and their nearly eleven-year-old nephew.

He was... not quite so normal.

Even now --- whilst doing nothing that would truly be called out of the ordinary --- the small, bespectacled youth lying on the hard, moisture-soaked floor of this ravaged shack stood out from the picture of uniform normality his relatives always tried to put forth. The three of them were all fast asleep, with the parents in the bedroom while their obese, blond-haired son occupied the cramped confines of the only couch in this out-of-the-way place.

This boy, on the other hand, was very much awake.

His intense green eyes were wide open as he peered around the dark interior of the shack, reminiscing on a great number of things as thunder shook the island he rested upon, chasing the flashes of lightning that lit up the otherwise pitch--black sky. They seemed as bright in the night as ethereal camera flashes.

Harry Potter felt the island shake and he could imagine the way the jagged lines of electricity lit up the sky outside, but he wasn\'t focusing on any of that. He was actually doing an admirable job of ignoring it --- though to do so completely would have been impossible.

Most of his attention was currently focused on something much more mundane than the unusually fierce storm raging outside, a fact his relatives may have actually been quite proud of had they not detested this boy as much as they did.

Most of Harry Potter\'s attention was focused on the small watch stretched to its breaking point on his cousin\'s fat wrist. In particular, the way both its hands ticked towards the number twelve at a pace so slow it physically pained him. When they reached the offending number, Harry Potter would no longer be ten years old. He would be eleven; and there was a small, naive part of him that liked to wish everything would change with the shifting of his age, even though he knew such thoughts were foolish and wishful.

Harry thought it reasonable to say he had never been particularly fortunate, and he couldn\'t see how the changing of his age might break that trend --- as much as he wanted to believe it was somehow possible.

At a year old, Harry had lost his parents to a car crash and been left on the doorstep of his relatives, who would later become constantly neglectful and occasionally abusive.

From an unreasonably early age, he was forced to take on all sorts of tasks around the house, some of which had been blatantly unsafe for a child of his age to partake in at all. He had been forced to rise early and then most of his day would be spent doing a vast number of things for his horrid relatives. The worst part of all, in Harry\'s opinion, was living in the cramped confines of the cupboard underneath the stairs.

He had always considered this last part to be needlessly cruel. His cupboard was terribly short on space, horribly uncomfortable, and not at all sanitary. The worst part of all was that his cousin Dudley had an entire spare room for his toys. Harry could have very easily slept in there, but the Dursleys had always viewed the cupboard as more than sufficient. In the often-vocalized opinion of his uncle, Harry should shut up, cease his moaning, and be grateful that they had taken him in at all.

For a long time, he had wished they hadn\'t.

He had desired nothing more than to be shipped off to an orphanage. For years, he naively believed the Dursleys to be exceptions as opposed to the norm. He had believed them to be the absolute worst of their kind, with no other possibly comparing to their cruelty and neglectfulness.

That belief had lasted until he started to regularly attend primary school.

Harry was a good student. He got stellar grades most of the time and did what he was told, keeping his head down along the way.

He had tried to make friends at first, but that hadn\'t lasted long. Dudley was surprisingly popular for reasons that Harry couldn\'t remotely comprehend. The boy had about as much brainpower as Uncle Vernon had neck. That was to say, none at all. Trying to hold a stimulating conversation with Dudley would have been as futile as attempting to outrun a cheetah. Impossible and a complete and utter waste of time, as well as possibly being detrimental to the health of any foolish enough to try.

Harry supposed his befuddlement over the situation mattered not. Dudley was much bigger than Harry, who was quite small for his age. On his own, Dudley was a handful at the best of times. With his posse of pandering followers who were almost as large and stupid as he was, Dudley was an absolute menace.

Not only did Dudley and his gang hunt Harry daily whilst at school --- doing their utmost to beat him to a pulp whenever they were able --- but they were shockingly effective in ensuring nobody came to his aid. No one wanted to cross Dudley or his gang. Therefore, no one wanted to befriend the strange, messy-haired youth who the group so often antagonized. The few children brave enough to break that unspoken rule had been made rather clear examples of, as had those who had picked Harry early when being team captains in PE or anything of a remotely similar nature.

This had been bad enough on its own, but what had been even worse was how the adults at the school had utterly failed him. They had ultimately turned out to be no better than the Dursleys; a fact that had been so crushing its oppressive weight was hard to describe.

None of the teachers went out of their way to help him and all of them sided with Dudley whenever they were presented the option. Perhaps if Harry had been a bit older and wiser, he might have considered the possibility of the Dursleys poisoning their perception of him from the onset. Unfortunately, at such an age, he hadn\'t thought with such rational clarity. It had only solidified his belief that he was alone and that no one was going to look out for him.

A belief that only grew stronger when strange, mysterious things had begun happening around him.

He hadn\'t been the slightest bit appalled when his teacher\'s hair had suddenly turned blue soon after falsely accusing him of cheating on a test on which he had earned a perfect score. What *had* appalled Harry had been the way she had somehow managed to blame it on him, landing him in trouble with the Dursleys in the process.

These odd instances had been yet another thing about his life. One that had not at all helped his living situation as the Dursleys detested anything odd. Harry personally thought they detested anything that was even mildly interesting, but that was a thought best left unsaid.

He had sometimes considered sneaking to the phone and calling the child services number he had heard mentioned on the television. He had never done so though, as every other adult he\'d ever known had failed him. They had still shown up once though.

Mrs. Figg, the old, odd cat-lady from across the way had called them, but they had failed just as Harry had feared they would.

They had been chased off quite easily by the Dursleys and had never returned. That had been one of the most severe punishments Harry had been subjected to, even though he hadn\'t done anything wrong.

He was actually quite surprised he hadn\'t been punished for his most recent escapade involving the boa constrictor at the London Zoo beyond time in his cupboard, nor for the hundreds of letters that had followed the Dursleys all across the country. All addressed in vivid green ink to a Master H. Potter.

Then again, he supposed being stranded on this desolate rock in this shell of a shack might have been punishment for many. It was certainly not comfortable, but at least it was interesting. It was far more stimulating than looking up at the dull underside of the Dursleys\' stairs, though not nearly as stimulating as the books he had frequented any time he was able to slip off to the library or sneak them into his cupboard, but he had never been able to count on those. In the last year or two, he was able to read much more frequently, but still not as much as he\'d liked.

The Dursleys monopolized most of that time, as did Dudley and his cruel group of friends.

*BANG! BANG! BANG!*

The thunderous slamming of something on the front door made the entire shack shake more than the ear-shattering claps of thunder had. Harry would likely have jumped so high he would have put his head through the boarded ceiling if not for the fact he was lying down.

He was understandably paranoid and hated sudden jolts.

How ironic that this sudden jolt would lead to his discovery of a mythical world of magic. One that might one day present him with the things he wanted above all else.

***Later that day, in Diagon Alley...***

By the time the afternoon began to age, Harry had resorted to numbly following in Hagrid\'s wake and remaining mostly silent. He was having far too much trouble processing all he had learned internally to focus too much attention and energy on vocalizing his thoughts and feelings externally.

They had just exited Flourish and Blotts and were presently trudging their way through the crowd. All the while, Harry was hoping beyond hope that he wasn\'t recognized again. The last thing he wanted was a repeat of the incident that had taken place earlier that day in the Leaky Cauldron.

He had found himself surprised to learn that he was obscenely famous. A fact he was blissfully ignorant about until late last night. Or, he supposed, early that morning; since it had been past midnight when Hagrid had ripped the door of the emaciated shack forcefully off its hinges and barged inside, revealing to Harry several incomprehensible truths that still had his mind reeling.

The most obvious of these truths was that he was a wizard.

All of the strange things that had happened around him and usually resulted in him landing in great trouble had been as a result of magic.

Apparently at his age, witches and wizards\' magic reacted harshly in certain situations. When magicians were particularly scared, thrilled, or upset, their magic would often react and manifest in a way that reflected their current mood. If they were suitably terrified, it might do its best to purge whatever it was that was terrifying them. If they were particularly cross with another person, it might lash out at that person.

That explained the blue hair, at least. Harry never had liked Mrs. Martin.

It explained a vast number of other things, too.

Like how he had shrunk the jumper Petunia persistently and fruitlessly tried to force him into when he was a great deal younger than he was now. How he had fixed a broken vase of Petunia\'s after being terrified of the repercussions he would face for inadvertently breaking it. It potentially explained how he had somehow set loose the snake at the zoo, and even how he had inexplicably appeared on a school roof one morning whilst fleeing from Dudley and his gang.

It had all been magic.

Magic was perhaps his new favourite thing in the world, despite the trouble it had landed him in numerous times over the course of his life.

It was due to his magical abilities that he would be escaping the Dursleys for ten full months come September. It was through magic that he had already decided he would no longer be vulnerable. Through magic, he would learn to ensure the Dursleys, or anyone else for that matter, wouldn\'t be kicking him around like a football.

Though, for all of its wonders, even magic seemed to have its evils, for it was no mere car crash that killed his parents.

No, they had died at the hands of a dark sorcerer. One the likes of which the British isles had not seen for centuries. A dark sorcerer who waged war on the entire nation through his bid for power; one whose name people up and down the country supposedly still feared speaking.

An odd name too, Voldemort. Rather... wizard-ish, Harry supposed; certainly not a name he had ever heard before that morning.

This man had supposedly decided to kill his parents when they had allegedly refused to join him. Just like all before them, they had fallen to Voldemort\'s might, but he had apparently failed to kill Harry --- then just an infant --- which made absolutely no sense to the youth in question.

It obviously made no sense to anybody, since no one had yet deduced exactly how Voldemort\'s curse had failed.

It was such a miraculous mystery that it was in fact the exact reason Harry was famous in the first place.

The Boy-Who-Lived, they called him.

Harry found this utterly ridiculous, but it was far better than anything he had experienced at Privet Drive, so he wasn\'t going to complain.

Complaining had never gotten him far in the past.

Since all of these revelations that morning, Harry\'s mind had been racing with questions and filled with unquenchable curiosity. Unquenchable curiosity that led him to purchase not only the standard array of Hogwarts-required books, but a small number of them for his own personal consumption. He would have to find some way of sneaking all of these into his cupboard, but he would manage.

Their next stop was a well-decorated shop that apparently sold every variety of robes, cloaks, and other wizarding attire that a person could ever need.

\"Listen, Harry,\" said Hagrid, wearing a sheepish expression that did not at all fit a man of his imposing size and stature. \"Would it be alright\' fer me to duck off \'n grab meself a quick pick-me-up at the Leaky Cauldron? Thought I\'d stay with yeh fer Flourish \'n Blotts, but them damn Gringotts carts do me stomach in every time.\"

Harry felt a large amount of nervousness rise like an elevator in the pit of his stomach at the prospect of being left alone; especially so soon after his entrance into a world which he was still vastly ignorant of. Yet, his immediate reaction was still to assure Hagrid that such a thing was perfectly acceptable and that Harry would manage just fine without him.

The bell chimed softly as Harry stepped through the door. As if she had been waiting for a signal, a rather well-dressed woman quickly bustled her way over to Harry, appraising him kindly as she did so.

\"Hogwarts, dear?\"

Harry nodded shyly in return. \"Yes, ma\'am.\"

She smiled at him. \"Right you are. There\'s another young boy getting fitted in the back, if you\'ll follow me.\"

Harry did just that and she led him to the back of the shop where several stepping-stools stood ready and waiting. Standing atop one of these stools was a fairly tall boy with perfectly slicked, platinum-blond hair. When Harry clambered onto the stool beside him, he could make out the boy\'s well-defined countenance and his cool grey eyes.

\"Hello,\" said the boy, \"Hogwarts, too?\"

\"Yes.\"

\"My father\'s next door buying my books and mother\'s up the street looking at wands,\" said the boy. He had a bored, drawling sort of voice. \"Then I\'m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don\'t see why first years can\'t have their own. I think I\'ll bully father into getting me one and I\'ll smuggle it in somehow.\"

Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley, something that did not immediately ingratiate this boy to him. Then again, he was considerate enough to at least speak with him, which was far more than he could say for his oaf of a cousin; who only spoke with Harry when it was a necessary component of whatever form of torment the large boy had planned.

\"Have you got your own broom?\" the boy went on.

\"No,\" said Harry.

\"Play Quidditch at all?\"

\"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.

Well, he supposed it logically must have been a game or sport of some sort --- since people apparently \'played it\' --- but that hardly narrowed it down.

\"I do --- Father says it\'s a crime if I\'m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\'ll be in yet?\"

\"No,\" Harry answered again, looking anywhere but at the boy beside him.

\"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they? I know I\'ll be in Slytherin --- all our family have been. Imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\'d leave, wouldn\'t you?\"

\"Now, now, Draco,\" said a calm, cool voice from behind them, \"no need to take shots at the poor \'Puffs. What have they ever done to you?\"

The voice --- which sounded a mix of amused and lightly chiding --- apparently belonged to a girl who appeared to be a few years older than either Harry or the boy stood beside him. He supposed the boy\'s name must be Draco, judging by this girl\'s address.

He got a good look at her a second or two later when she stepped out from behind them and instead chose to stand at their front. She was quite a bit taller than either Harry or Draco. She had the same coloured hair as the blond beside Harry, though hers was long, silky, and flowed elegantly down her back. Her eyes were grey as well, but not exactly the same shade as the boy who Harry was quickly realizing could be nobody but this girl\'s little brother. They were several shades brighter and had a bluish sort of hue to them, whereas Draco\'s were darker and purer in their colouration.

The boy beside Harry made a face at her. \"What does it matter?\" he asked. \"It\'s not like I\'ll be in Hufflepuff, anyway.\"

\"Things aren\'t always that simple,\" the new arrival said patiently. \"There are plenty of important people in Hufflepuff, even if you\'re not one of them. You would do well not to offend all of them as soon as you meet.\"

Draco turned a rather obvious shade of pink and the girl now turned her attention to Harry. This was odd, as Harry could never remember a time when an older girl had ever spared him anything more than a passing glance.

Her stare swept quickly over his battered, second-hand robes before slowly roaming up over his face. He thought he saw her eyes widen for a fraction of a second and he immediately feared she had discovered him.

But a rather polite smile was plastered on her face as she properly addressed him for the first time.

\"I\'m sorry if my brother came off a bit... brash. He\'s excited to start Hogwarts, as you can obviously tell.\"

\"That\'s... okay,\" Harry answered, having to scramble for the words, surprised that this conversation was taking place at all.

Her smile widened and she held out her hand; still standing on the floor in front of where Harry was just now getting the finishing touches put on his robes.

\"I don\'t think my brother ever introduced himself, so let me fix that. I\'m Diana Malfoy, Heiress of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Malfoy. This is my little brother, Draco. He\'ll be starting his first year at Hogwarts in September.\" Harry hesitantly took her offered hand with the air of somebody holding something particularly intriguing that might explode at any moment. \"What\'s your name, if you don\'t mind me asking?\"

There was a pause of about three seconds during which Harry seriously considered refusing to answer or giving a fake name. He quickly decided against either, as the first would be rude and the second would necessitate him coming up with a fake name --- something he was entirely too fatigued to bother with right now.

\"I\'m Harry. Harry Potter.\"

Diana\'s eyes narrowed with a look he had seen from the Dursleys many a time. A look they often wore right before accusing him of something. He couldn\'t ponder on it for long, though. He almost fell off the stool as the woman finishing up with his robes suddenly stabbed him painfully with the pin.

\"Gah!\" he exclaimed, only saved from falling by the girl in front of him reaching up and placing a brief, yet steadying hand on his shoulder. It made him tense, but it was gone so fast it hardly mattered.

\"I\'m terribly sorry, dear!\" the woman behind him exclaimed, hastening to apologize for her error. \"It\'s just... well, I was ever so surprised, you see?\"

\"Are you really Harry Potter?\" Draco Malfoy asked from beside him, stepping down off his own stool and gazing at Harry with much more interest than he had shown before.

Harry had to forcefully resist the urge to shrink back as irrational thoughts of retreating to his cupboard made themselves known at the corners of his mind.

This was not the time for nonsense like that.

\"I am, yes,\" answered Harry, looking down at the floor once more.

\"I\'m sorry if I came across as rude,\" Draco said hastily. \"You caught me on a bit of a long day, is all. Sorry if I said anything that upset you.\"

This baffled Harry more than anything else.

He wasn\'t sure if anyone had ever apologized to him in all of his life. If they had, he certainly couldn\'t remember it happening.

\"Don\'t mention it,\" he returned with a small smile, stepping off the stool as he saw Hagrid approaching down the street from out the large, front window. \"You didn\'t say anything that offended me.\"

\"Good,\" said Draco, noticeably relaxing as he held out his own hand to Harry. \"I hope we can talk more at Hogwarts then?\" When Harry slowly nodded, he smiled.

\"You can always owl, too,\" Diana reminded them.

\"Um... I\'m new to all this,\" Harry admitted reluctantly. \"How does that work, exactly? Do I need to write an address, or...\"

Draco looked about as stunned as if somebody had just punched him in the face, but Diana rested what looked to be a firm hand on his shoulder before he could speak; taking it upon herself to do so in his place.

\"There\'s no need for an address, no. Just write the name of the person you want the letter to get to. The owl will find them; they always do.\" She smiled warmly at the way Harry\'s shoulders seemed to sag in relief as all tension ebbed immediately out of his body. \"If you have any questions over the summer, we would be happy to help. Just write a letter to Draco or I, and we\'ll write back to you as soon as we can.\"

\"You\'re... sure?\" Harry asked with wide eyes, blown completely away by the sudden kindness shown to him by a complete and total stranger.

Two of them, even.

She smiled at him once more. \"Of course. It\'s no trouble at all. There\'s no reason you shouldn\'t get help if you need it, and I\'d be happy to be of assistance. Draco too, I\'m sure.\"

\"Of course,\" Draco said primly, straightening his posture and looking extremely modest. \"I say,\" he said, nodding towards the front window, \"Look at that man!\" Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\'t come in.

\"That\'s Hagrid,\" said Harry, oddly pleased to know something this Draco Malfoy didn\'t. \"He works at Hogwarts.\"

\"Oh,\" Draco hummed, \"I\'ve heard of him. He\'s a sort of servant, isn\'t he?\"

\"He\'s the gamekeeper,\" said Diana, glancing out of the window with a rather puzzled-looking expression. \"Why he would be here doing... that, I have no idea.\"

\"He\'s my escort,\" Harry explained. \"He\'s the one who took me here and is showing me around.\"

Again, Diana jumped into the conversation just as Draco was opening his mouth. His face flushed, but he didn\'t comment on it.

\"That\'s strange. If you only just found out about the magical world, it should be Professor McGonagall escorting you --- she teaches Transfiguration and is the Deputy Headmistress.\"

Harry shrugged, having no real idea how best to respond to that. It wasn\'t as if he could answer her unasked question.

\"You had better get back to him, anyway,\" Diana continued, looking back towards Harry as opposed to out of the open window. \"He seems a bit... impatient. Just remember, you can write us anytime you need.\"

\"Thank you,\" said Harry, sharing one last smile with the two siblings before thanking the shopkeeper, taking the bag of robes she offered, and striding out the door before rejoining Hagrid on this odd, magical journey.

From a ways down the street, a tall, well-dressed man with long, luscious hair watched the retreating forms of a hulking, rough-looking man and a much smaller, raven-haired boy with great interest.

Interest that only mounted when his son and daughter exited the same store that the black-haired youth in question had just left himself. Interest that swelled still more when his two children cast furtive, meaningful glances in the boy\'s direction while conversing in low, hurried whispers.

Yes, Lucius would most certainly be inquiring about all of this.

**Author\'s Endnote:**

**I won\'t go on for too long about this story, because I have an entire blog on my website in which I do just that. Just find my website through a basic google search, or through my profile, scroll down to blogs, and click the PoP release blog if you want more details.**

**I will, however, give some bullet points:**

**If any of you expect this to be anything like my story Ashes of Chaos, just curb all of those expectations right now. That is a story where I make massive changes to Harry\'s character from the onset and write ridiculously vast and admittedly over the top arcs. This is going to be my take on a realistic dark Harry. This is very much how I think Harry could have gone down a path of darkness if the series was geared towards adults instead of children.**

**There are some AU changes --- such as the inclusion of Diana Malfoy --- but Harry starts off very much the same as his canonical counterpart. No godlike wandless magic at the age of six or anything of the sort. There is a political side of this story and yes, heirs and lords will be mentioned. I can assure you, however, that there will be no eleven-year-old politicians or any such nonsense. If Harry ever enters that field, it will be years from now.**

**This is very much a slightly more jaded, slightly more well-read canon Harry in Slytherin. My goal with this fic is to really make it feel real. As a result, the years will all be subject to reasonable, novel-length pacing. By example, book 1 is 13 chapters and 86k words. It should be noted though that all years will be posted under this same story on FFN.**

**Year 1 will follow canon more closely than any other. After year 1, it will diverge fast; but again, it will do so with what I hope is a degree of gritty realism.**

**Chapters will be posted on FFN and AO3 every Sunday and Wednesday until the end of each book. At that point, there will be a significant delay between years, and then posting will continue at the same pace. This story will also be posted in audio form on YouTube and Spotify once the audio gets edited, just at a slower rate.**

**Obligatory warning right here that this story is rated M for a reason. There will be very mature themes, language not suitable to young audiences, and occasionally scenes of an especially graphic manner. I will also say right now that the actions of my characters are in no way reflective of myself as a person. I am warning everyone upfront that this story gets *dark.***

**You have all been warned and I hope you all enjoy.**

**Chapter 2: Finding the Path**

***September 1, 1991***

***King\'s Cross Station***

***10:41 AM***

Nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the first morning of September. Nothing even seemed particularly interesting or exciting, if truth was to be told.

The sky was a deep, dull grey; casting a gloomy veil across Great Britain. It personified the moods of the many muggle children who would soon be returning to school. The clouds seemed to lament the fast-approaching start of a new week; along with the country\'s older population as well, who would, come Monday, be returning to the uniform drone of work.

It wasn\'t even as though the clouds brought with them the promise of a storm, the existence of which would have at least been far less dull than the pointless sense of gloom currently presiding over the nation. All they brought was the promise of a dull, dreary day that would likely be draining for any residing far beneath them.

This is what a casual observer would have believed.

It was actually what the vast majority of the population thought, but a small, select group of beings thought quite differently about this day --- despite the seemingly dreary monotony of the sky.

For this very select group of rather abnormal individuals, this day meant the start of something truly special, no matter what the heavens might have reflected, particularly for those who hadn\'t yet experienced the majesty of this day.

Even more so in the case of a small, thin boy pushing a trolley that looked altogether too heavy for him as he did his best to discreetly weave through the whirring masses that occupied London\'s major train station.

For Harry Potter, this day not only meant the start of a magical journey that he would never have imagined five weeks ago; it also meant the escape from a far less than magical prison, one he had dreamed of escaping since he had first understood what dreams even were.

He wasn\'t actually sure which delighted him more. The thought of learning the awe-inspiring things he had spent most of his waking moments reading about over the last month, or escaping a hellacious life that he had always believed to have been inescapable.

That life had been slightly less hellacious over the month that had just died a peaceful death, but it was still one he very much wanted to escape from.

Harry had returned from Diagon Alley late in the evening on his birthday to some unexpected changes at his relatives\' home.

Uncle Vernon had not been furiously awaiting his arrival, as Harry had feared might be the case. In fact, he barely even saw his uncle or his aunt over the next month. They hadn\'t retracted their decision to give him Dudley\'s spare bedroom, much to their son\'s displeasure. They had even allowed their estranged nephew to spend as much time as he wanted in his new room, only interrupting his solitude to pass him meagre amounts of whatever meal they had eaten.

Many eleven-year-old boys would have been disheartened by this lack of human interaction, but Harry found himself in awe at his sudden dose of good fortune. No interaction with the Dursley family had ever been a positive one, and he was more than happy to be left completely to his own devices --- not to mention they had lifted the preposterously long list of chores off his shoulders.

Harry wasn\'t given anything special to pass the time, but he\'d hardly needed more than he had. He had made excellent use of the quiet and spent much of his days nose-deep in textbooks. He wasn\'t one of those child prodigies from the news who could immediately devour tomes as if they were crumpets, but by the time September the first had come around, he thought he had a strong grasp on the first-year material.

More so in Transfiguration and especially in Defence Against the Dark Arts. Those were the subjects that interested him most and they were the subjects he poured the most time into. History was another one he frequented, both to hopefully cure his vast ignorance of the magical world and because he found it genuinely interesting.

When he wasn\'t reading, he had been writing to Draco and Diana.

The latter often recommended him more books to read, which he would owl order from Flourish and Blotts --- after being informed that was indeed a thing that wizards did. All of the books Diana recommended were more culturally centred. They would be the books that would hopefully help him better adapt to the world he was entering.

He found the absurd amount of etiquette exhausting and he knew there was no hope he would ever have it all memorized by September 1st. Diana had been a great help there, pointing him in the direction of the more essential bits he needed to get down and informing him which passages could be left for a much later date.

She had been exceedingly helpful, and she very well may have saved him from a particularly embarrassing spot of trouble that might have otherwise arisen at King\'s Cross Station.

Harry had asked Uncle Vernon for a drive into London only days before he was set to catch the Hogwarts Express. His uncle had grunted in compliance and asked to see exactly which platform Harry would be boarding the train from. He\'d then taken savage pleasure in ruthlessly mocking the idiocy of wizards, pointing out that there was no such thing as a platform numbered \'nine and three quarters.\'

Harry had been forced to grudgingly concede he had a point and hurriedly wrote to Diana. She was a Hogwarts third year --- as she had told him in a previous bit of correspondence --- so this wouldn\'t be her first time through the process.

Her return letter made Harry equal parts relieved and nervous.

Relieved because he had indeed gotten the answer he had so desperately needed, and nervous because Diana was asking him to walk face-first into a stone wall.

That did not sound at all appealing, even if it was supposed to allow him to pass straight through. What would happen if the enchantment failed? Harry had no idea if an enchantment could even fail, but it had been a concern that had quickly risen to the forefront of his mind.

Diana seemed to have found his concerns quite amusing, but she had sent him a book to dissuade his worries, as well as where in the book to look. According to *Hogwarts, A History*, the platform had been fully operational for centuries. It mentioned no occasions on which it had ever failed, something that came as a small relief to Harry.

Not that it made walking straight into a wall any less daunting, but he supposed he would just have to manage.

His letters to Draco had been far more casual.

The youngest Malfoy had happily explained to Harry exactly what Quidditch was, and he had even sent him a copy of a book on the subject --- *Quidditch Through the Ages*. He had raved about not only flying, but other magical things in the wizarding world that he couldn\'t wait to introduce Harry to as well. He had also spoken very briefly about a few of his friends, but he hadn\'t given Harry a whole lot of details.

In his last letter, there had been a request for Harry to meet him on the platform. Draco said that he, his sister, and his parents would be waiting near the front of the Hogwarts Express, and he had warned Harry that the platform could be a bit of a madhouse if one waited until the last possible moment to arrive.

Harry had feared his uncle\'s spite might lead him to drop him off with just enough time to make it onto the Hogwarts Express. What he ended up finding quite amusing was that his uncle\'s unearthly desire to forever be punctual seemed more powerful than his dislike of Harry. The youth in question was dropped off with more than enough time to make it onto the platform, even while hauling the damned trolley that was far too heavy for his rather slight form.

Now, he stood just a short distance away from the barrier which was directly in front of him. To Harry, it did not look as though his path was unobstructed, though it very much was. His mind --- still hesitant to willingly walk head-first into a wall --- was playing tricks on him. It felt as though he stood at the foot of a towering precipice, one that was as steep as it was dangerous.

He closed his eyes and took a deep, centring breath, trying his best to ignore the way his own heart seemed to try and beat straight out of his chest, like a particularly rambunctious monkey pounding and rattling against the sides of the cage which held it captive.

Once his breath was finally under control, Harry opened his eyes with the air of one who had just come to terms with their fast-approaching execution after living in denial for many years. He marched forward quickly and got about halfway to the barrier before his walk became a run, so desperate he was to get the experience over with as fast as his short, knobby legs could carry him.

His heart rate quickened as the wall approached faster and faster, seeming to defy logic, for Harry could not imagine how the muscle\'s pounding could grow more intense. There was a split-second when he\'d traversed about two-thirds of the distance to the period in which he considered turning, slowing down, or coming to a full stop. The thought was brief though, and Harry marched on, shutting his eyes and praying to any higher deity that might exist that he didn\'t split his skull on the solid wall he would run into at any moment...

To his relief, he never did.

Passing through it felt odd, but not uncomfortable. Yet Harry knew at once that he had indeed passed through. His stomach dropped oddly as if he were in a speeding car racing down a steep incline.

His eyes snapped open as soon as he was sure he had crossed to the other side, and what he saw made his jaw hang slack until he managed to compose himself. He then proceeded to grin like a mad scientist whose latest experiment had yielded amusingly explosive results.

The platform was vast and open-aired, filled with people moving this way and that. Most of them appeared to be wearing what Harry thought looked to be traditional wizard robes, but there were more than a fair number donned in muggle attire that he found far more recognizable. A scarlet steam engine dominated the platform, standing proudly in the centre and drawing the attention of all, aided by the words *Hogwarts Express* emblazoned flamboyantly in gold upon its side.

Harry cast his eyes around the platform as he walked --- with no small bit of apprehension --- towards the front of the train, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Malfoy family.

They weren\'t exactly difficult to find.

Their features were distinct and their pale hair was quite eye-catching. Draco and Diana were already in robes, as were their parents.

One was a slim, beautiful woman with long, silky blonde hair that perfectly matched her daughter\'s. Harry imagined the blue hue in Diana\'s eyes came from this woman, for her eyes were a dark blue instead of the stormy grey of her son\'s and husband\'s. The man beside her had the stormy grey eyes that have already been mentioned and they only added to his imposing figure. He was tall and looked much like his son, but his hair was significantly longer.

It didn\'t take away from the intimidating image that was greatly aided by the serpentine cane he leaned on quite lazily. His relaxed demeanour only added to the air of power and danger that seemed to surround him. Everything about this man screamed power, but it did so nonchalantly and in a way that implied that he didn\'t need to go out of his way to be powerful, nor did he require effort to be dangerous. He was both of those things without effort, and that more than anything else was what did his image wonders.

The four of them were resplendent in royal-looking robes that were unmistakably of the highest quality money could buy, and all four sets of eyes belonging to the figures in question loomed ominously on Harry before he\'d even seen them; though he did not know this, of course.

\"Harry,\" Draco greeted pompously and with a small smile when the shorter boy slowly and cautiously crept his way into speaking range. \"How was the rest of your summer?\"

\"Not as exciting as yours, by the sound of it.\"

Draco\'s lips twitched upwards. \"Yes, well, not everyone can be me, I suppose.\" He turned towards the older figures, who were most certainly his parents, before looking back to Harry. \"Harry, this is my mother and father. The lord and lady of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Malfoy.\"

Harry waited for Lucius to greet him first. It was the proper decorum when meeting one who outranked you; to let them extend the offer of conversation, or to decide against doing just that.

From a hierarchical standpoint, the Potters and Malfoys were actually on even footing. They were both Ancient and Most Noble Houses, the second-highest rung of Magical Britain\'s complex political ladder.

The only rung higher was that belonging to the Founding Twelve families who were responsible for the founding of the Wizengamot nearly a thousand years ago, but most of those families were extinct or no longer relevant. Only a select few still remained.

Below them were Ancient and Most Noble Houses, which themselves were a rung above Ancient and Noble Houses, which sat atop both Ancient Houses and mere houses.

A house was a family on the Wizengamot that didn\'t meet any of the prerequisites for a higher designation. Any family could technically gain a seat, but they would need to pay the annual Wizengamot fees that were quite exorbitant, and they would need to do just that for five years to prove that they could reliably do so before their seat was granted.

Ancient Houses were families that had done this, but that had also lived within the borders of Great Britain for thirteen generations --- equating to roughly four hundred years. The two rungs above were for families who met this designation, but also ones who had a particular number of Order of Merlin recipients, Chief Warlocks, or Hogwarts Headmasters in their history. The number of any of these or a combination of the three could elevate an otherwise Ancient House to one of the next two rungs if the number itself was significant enough.

The Potters and Malfoys may technically have had equal status, but Lucius was a lord and Harry was only an heir. This was something that had confused him, but Diana had cleared it up in a letter. He was too young to be a lord, despite being the only remaining Potter alive. One day, when he inevitably took his seat on the Wizengamot, he and Lord Malfoy would be looked upon as equals, but that day had not yet come.

Draco\'s father waited a moment before stepping forward, extending a hand to Harry, who took it cautiously, mildly taken aback by the man\'s exceedingly firm grip.

\"Heir Potter,\" he greeted in a polished voice that seemed smoother than silk. \"It is such a great honour to meet you after all these years. Many of our kind have waited long and patiently for this opportunity.\"

Harry very nearly stumbled on his reply, but just managed to prevent it. He hardly imagined that would have gone far in making a positive first impression on one of the most important men in the country, not to mention one who intimidated him more than he would ever admit.

\"Thank you, Lord Malfoy. It\'s nice to meet you.\"

There was an odd spark in the man\'s eye, but Harry couldn\'t quite place it. \"It is a great pleasure to meet you as well,\" said Lord Malfoy, turning to his wife. \"I present to you my wife, the lady of our house.\"

Narcissa\'s hand was far softer to shake than her husband\'s, though her grip was just as firm. Her eyes seemed more searching than even those of Lucius, and she studied Harry in a way that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.

\"Lady Malfoy,\" he greeted with the utmost politeness.

Narcissa smiled a warm smile that had the effect of putting most subjected to it at ease. \"There\'s no need to be so formal, dear. We\'re family, after all.\" When she saw Harry\'s blank, puzzled expression, she suddenly looked solemn. \"Didn\'t you know?\" He shook his head, looking rather dejected. Narcissa tutted. \"It\'s hardly your fault, from what I\'ve heard. No matter --- we will have to remedy that in time. Your grandmother was Dorea Black, who just so happened to be my favourite aunt.\"

Harry felt his heart leap as too many butterflies for such a confined space seemed to try and force their way into his innards. \"Did-did you know my parents, too?\"

Narcissa frowned deeply. \"Not nearly as well,\" she admitted. \"I knew your father some, but we more so knew of each other than anything else. I know more about them than I knew them.\" She didn\'t fail to miss the way Harry\'s expression had begun to fall before suddenly lighting up at that last revelation. \"I would be happy to write you about them if you\'d like. I don\'t know a great deal, but I can tell you what I know.\"

\"That... yes, I\'d like that.\" Harry found speaking quite difficult, as his throat seemed oddly obstructed, but he managed to croak out those words nevertheless.

Narcissa smiled. \"Consider it done, and please do call me Narcissa. I hope you won\'t mind if I call you Harry, in return.\" He shook his head frantically, so dazed by the interaction that he hardly noticed her parting smile.

\"You three had best make haste,\" Lord Malfoy told Harry, Draco, and Diana. \"If you doddle for too long, there won\'t be any decent seats left. I won\'t have my heiress, son and their friend forced to sit with the common riff-raff.\"

Draco and Diana nodded, so Harry thought it likely a good idea to nod along. Lord Malfoy returned the gesture with his own, curt variant of it.

\"Good. Write to us often and behave.\" His eyes were fixed mostly on Draco, who nodded quickly to show he understood. \"Represent the Malfoy family with dignity and proper decorum at all times.\" His stare suddenly flicked towards Harry. \"If you require any assistance, Heir Potter, I am always welcoming owls from the likes of you.\"

\"Th-thank you, sir.\"

Lucius beckoned them all off and Harry struggled behind Draco and Diana, lugging his heavy trunk along with him. \"You didn\'t get one with a Featherlight Charm?\" Draco asked, clearly appalled by the very idea.

\"A what?\" asked Harry, having never heard of such things in his life.

\"Battered old thing, too,\" Diana observed, even though Harry thought the trunk looked quite pristine. \"We can help him get a better one when we\'re at Hogwarts,\" she told Draco. \"No doubt Hagrid never explained the right sort of things to get.\"

\"There are different sorts of trunks?\"

\"All kinds,\" Draco said with a wave of his hand. \"You\'ll want the best of the best, of course. Money shouldn\'t be an issue, being a Potter. You\'ll want the trunk with a password, Featherlight Charm, and Spatial Expansion Charm. You couldn\'t live in it or anything ridiculous, but it will give you plenty more room than *that*.\" He said the last word with noticeable distaste, and Harry suddenly felt far out of his depths compared to these two.

Diana discreetly withdrew her wand and tapped it on Harry\'s trunk. She muttered something in what sounded like Latin and the trunk really did become as light as a feather.

\"It\'s a third-year spell?\" asked Draco.

\"No, but Charms is by far my best subject.\" Diana offered Harry a kind smile. \"Don\'t let it bother you. It\'s not your fault you weren\'t properly informed. It will just be up to people like us to fix that.\"

\"Yes,\" said Draco, sounding rather smug about the whole thing. \"We\'ll make sure you get on with the right sort.\"

\"The... right sort?\"

\"Mhm, the right sort, yes. You\'ll learn pretty quickly that some families are much better than others.\"

This made perfect sense to Harry, for he had lived with the worst family imaginable. It was true that he didn\'t think at all fondly of muggles in general, and thought most of them likely not worth a bronze knut next to wizards as obviously kind as the Malfoys, but he knew some families to be better than the Dursleys. He could understand better than most that some folk were just far superior to others.

\"I\'ll stop in to see you two later,\" promised Diana when the three of them came to an empty compartment near the back, and the older girl gestured for the two younger boys to move inside. \"I\'m going to go see if any of my friends have arrived yet and save them a compartment if not.\"

\"Best of luck,\" Draco said as Harry hurriedly thanked her, listening to her fast-retreating footsteps as he and Draco took seats in the compartment after easily lifting their featherlight trunks into the overhead storage rack above.

\"I am not looking forward to this train ride,\" moaned Draco. \"It\'s going to be terribly long.\"

\"At least Hogwarts is at the end of it,\" said Harry.

\"True. A small mercy, that. I don\'t think I would be able to stand it otherwise.\" A silence stretched between them before the blond dared to ask a particularly bold question. \"Is it really true you\'ve been living with muggles?\"

Harry had told him so in one of his letters, but it seemed so unbelievable to Draco that he had to ask in person.

Harry sighed. \"Yeah, my aunt, uncle, and cousin on my mum\'s side.\"

Draco looked suddenly sympathetic. \"That must have been awful.\"

\"You have no idea,\" Harry muttered darkly.

\"Is that why you\'d never heard of Quidditch or Featherlight Charms?\" Harry nodded sorrowfully. Draco sneered. \"Leave it up to a bunch of worthless muggles to keep the heir of an Ancient and Most Noble House from knowing a thing about the world he belongs to. Scum, the lot of them.\"

Harry felt as though the morally proper thing was to disagree, but he couldn\'t find it within himself to do that, so he said and did nothing.

\"Don\'t worry, I\'ll make sure you get all caught up. So will my friends once you meet them.\"

\"Thanks,\" said Harry, looking anywhere in the compartment but at Draco. \"They... won\'t think badly of me for not knowing these sorts of things or anything?\"

Draco hesitated for a fraction of a second too long. \"I\'m sure it will be fine,\" he said after that very brief pause. \"While we\'re waiting though, it might not hurt to make sure you... have a few things straight.\"

Draco made sure Harry knew the definitions of muggleborn, halfblood, and pureblood before quizzing him on the basics of the four Hogwarts houses. Harry had answered all of this quickly, and then Draco went over a very brief summary of the political system that was earlier spoken upon before he, at last, seemed satisfied.

\"That should do,\" he decided with no small bit of satisfaction. \"Anything else, we can talk about later.\" His pale, pointed face curved into a broad smile. \"Care to see how wizard\'s chess works?\"

Harry was in awe of the magical pieces that moved on command without the need for their commander to lift so much as a finger. He hadn\'t had much experience with chess, so Draco beat him easily, but he found he was enjoying the game nevertheless and was improving with great speed.

Roughly ten minutes after the train had rolled out of Platform Nine and Three Quarters, there came a knock on the door.

A boy and a girl stood outside. The boy was taller than Harry but shorter than Draco. He wasn\'t quite as pale as the youngest Malfoy and had very dark eyes and medium-length brown hair. He had a guarded look about him and a more athletic-looking frame than either Harry or Draco. The girl beside him was a couple of inches shorter with shiny black hair, deep brown eyes, and a face that Harry cynically compared to that of a pug.

\"Pansy, Theodore,\" Draco greeted with a fond-looking smile.

\"Draco!\" exclaimed the girl whose name must have been Pansy. \"How was your summer? It\'s been ages since we\'ve last talked!\"

Draco rolled his eyes. \"Pansy, it hasn\'t been *that* long. We spent most of the day together on my birthday and the solstice.\"

\"Yes, but you\'ve been gone all of August and we never met up in July!\"

\"How was France?\" asked the boy called Theodore, whose dark eyes left Harry for the first time since entering the compartment. It was a relief they had, since they had practically been burning a hole into his face.

\"Well enough,\" said Draco. \"Not the first time I\'ve been there, of course. Mother is very fond of Paris.\"

\"Paris is wonderful,\" Pansy said dreamily. \"My parents took me for my birthday last year. They always told me when I turned eleven, they\'d take me anywhere I wanted.\"

\"Never been,\" said Theodore. \"Father has never been much of a traveller.\"

\"I don\'t reckon you have either, Harry?\" Draco asked, effectively drawing all attention onto the quietest of the gathered quartet.

Harry would have scoffed had the new pairs of eyes not made him so self-conscious. \"Never been out of Britain,\" he admitted quietly.

\"Who\'s this, Draco?\" asked Theodore, seeming to ignore the fact Harry was right in front of him and in a perfect position to be asked.

\"Oh, have I forgotten to introduce him?\" It was *very* clear to even Harry that was not the case at all.

Even he could tell that Draco had intentionally left this for the most opportune moment, better to get a reaction. This annoyed Harry, who really didn\'t want the attention, but he said nothing. He didn\'t want to upset Draco or to ruin his fun. It was harmless, really. It just made him uncomfortable, which he was quite adept at dealing with, so he remained quiet.

\"You have,\" said the boy with narrowed eyes and obvious suspicion.

Draco looked sheepish. \"Sorry, I must have gotten distracted.\"

Even without piecing together Draco\'s intentions moments earlier, Harry knew it was a lie. He could almost always tell when somebody was lying. It was one of the many strange things about him. People just couldn\'t seem to lie to him and get away with it. He could just... feel when they were hiding something and he usually had a good indication as to whether or not they were trustworthy.

\"Theodore, Pansy,\" Draco continued, and it was obvious by now he was exercising a great deal of effort not to grin like a fool. \"I\'d like you to meet Harry Potter, Heir of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Potter.\"

Nott\'s eyes widened as his jaw loosened and Pansy let out a loud, undignified squeak of surprise.

\"Harry,\" continued Draco, \"meet Pansy Parkinson, Heiress of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Parkinson.\"

\"So nice to meet you,\" the girl gushed hastily, all at once appearing to recover from the state of awe Draco had befallen upon her as she smiled broadly and extended her hand to Harry, who took it clumsily.

\"And Theodore Nott,\" Draco went on. \"Heir of the Founding House of Nott.\"

The Notts were one of the few remaining Founding Houses in Magical Britain, along with the Greengrasses, Longbottoms, Selwyns, and the Blacks. There were technically members of the Founding House of Lestrange still alive, but they currently called Azkaban prison home and were set to do just that until their final days had elapsed.

Theodore Nott didn\'t immediately extend a heartfelt greeting as Parkinson had a moment earlier. \"Why is he here?\" he asked Draco. \"Surely, th... he\'s one of Dumbledore\'s?\"

Harry had no idea what that meant, nor what he\'d originally been intending to say. It confused him greatly, but he stayed silent and trusted Draco to better speak on his behalf.

\"Relax, Nott. I met him in the alley and we\'ve been talking ever since. Harry\'s a good sort; he just has a lot of catching up to do.\"

\"Catching up?\"

Draco sneered. \"One of the reasons I doubt he\'ll have any love for Dumbledore. He was raised by muggles --- no doubt it was *the old fool\'s* idea.\"

\"MUGGLES!?\" screeched Pansy.

Draco just nodded solemnly. \"You can ask him yourself if you don\'t believe me. He is right there, you know.\"

\"Were you really raised by muggles?\" Nott asked with an interesting mix of disgust, skepticism, and something that Harry couldn\'t place. He nodded, and Nott\'s eyes narrowed once more. \"What did you think of them?\"

\"They were horrible. Worst people I\'ve ever met.\"

\"Just the ones who raised you, or others you met?\"

Harry thought about that. \"I\'ve never met a good one.\"

For a reason he couldn\'t entirely work out, Nott seemed to relax before offering his hand at last. \"Theodore Nott, like Draco said. Heir of the Founding House of Nott. I\'m not sure if you know what that means because of... muggles, but I\'m sure we can catch you up if you don\'t.\"

\"I do,\" Harry said, taking his hand and inclining his head.

Nott\'s eyebrows knit together. \"So you do know about our world?\"

\"Not really,\" Harry admitted, fidgeting. \"I only just found out I was a wizard in July. I\'ve just been reading all I can ever since. I\'m still miles behind.\" He suddenly looked down towards the floor as a horrible thought crossed his mind for not the first time in the past number of hours, days, or weeks. \"I have so much catching up to do. I always did pretty well in school, and I\'ve read over a lot of the first-year textbooks, but I\'ll probably be so far behind that I\'ll be one of the worst in the year.\"

\"Rubbish,\" Draco dismissed. \"You might start out a bit behind some of the purebloods, but you\'ll catch up. None of the muggleborns have ever used magic in their lives, and a lot of the halfbloods haven\'t either.\"

\"Even some pureblood families don\'t let their kids use magic,\" put in Pansy with obvious distaste.

\"Not any of our families, though,\" said Theodore Nott. \"We all know a bit, even if we haven\'t had much time to practice. If you\'re the right sort like Draco says, we\'ll help you catch up.\"

\"If you\'ve read a lot of the first-year books, I\'m sure you\'ll do fine,\" said Pansy. \"Even we don\'t know that much magic.\" Nott cleared his throat and she rolled her eyes. \"Okay, well Theodore\'s father showed him more than most purebloods learn, but I don\'t know very much magic at all. Just the theory and all about the world.\"

\"The same goes for me,\" agreed Draco. \"Father has taught me a few useful spells and Diana has shown me quite a few of them, but we all only just got wands back in July, too. Even if we know more magic, it doesn\'t mean we\'ve actually had enough time to practice it.\"

\"Point is,\" Nott summarized, \"you\'ll do fine, as long as you stick with the right sort.\"

Harry couldn\'t help but notice how often \'the right sort\' had been mentioned, and he didn\'t quite understand what it meant. He didn\'t much care though, for he was just relieved that all seemed to be going well.

He might just have found friends at long last, and friends who might even help him.

Perhaps all of this would go much better than he had ever imagined.

It was sometime later that the two final members of Draco\'s group joined them. These were the largest boys their age that Harry had ever seen. They would have made Dudley whimper and cower in fear. Their names were Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle; though they just went by Crabbe and Goyle, according to Draco. They were the friends Harry had heard about in the youngest Malfoy\'s letters, as they were the ones who joined him quite often in the sky on broomsticks for games of Quidditch --- a sport that sounded so magnificent Harry couldn\'t wait to see it.

After an hour or so had passed, the constant sprawl of buildings had vanished and the skyline had suddenly cleared. Now, they were speeding past vast fields that were blanketed in a myriad of brilliant autumn colours. From out the window of the speeding Hogwarts Express, it appeared as though the train was racing past immense and vibrantly painted patches of earth. The sight was made all the more lurid by the otherwise dreary look of the world brought on by the thick clouds high above, making the bright yellows and oranges stand out even more than they would have otherwise.

This all would have been quite breathtaking to Harry, but he was altogether more distracted by the conversation in the compartment. They talked endlessly of a great number of things, some of which he knew and some of which he didn\'t.

By the time their stomachs began to rumble, they had started playing poker, which Harry had absolutely no idea how to play.

Pansy was teaching him while Draco and Theodore played, and Crabbe and Goyle partook in a different, more enjoyable-looking game called exploding snap. Harry had been eager up until Draco had told him it was rather undignified, at which point he\'d sorrowfully given it up and began listening intently to Pansy explaining the rules of poker.

Apparently, some of the more illustrious families taught their heirs the game at a young age. It helped teach them to bluff, was how Theodore had explained it. Supposedly, bluffing was a major part of politics, not that Harry would have known such things.

The door slid open not long after this practice had begun and a rather plump woman with a kind-looking face stuck her head inside. \"Anything off the trolley, dears?\"

Crabbe and Goyle practically leapt to their feet and they were the first out the door. The other purebloods moved more carefully, with Harry bringing up the rear. For the first time in his life, he had actual money; and a fair amount of it, at that. He intended to buy as many Mars bars as he could carry.

But they didn\'t have Mars bars, and he found himself immensely confused by the perplexing collection of sweets that the trolly did carry.

\"Oh, I guess you\'ve never seen any of this, have you?\" Pansy asked as all the others crowded around the trolley and loaded their pockets with a bit --- or in the case of Crabbe and Goyle --- *a lot* of everything. Harry just shook his head. \"Here,\" said Pansy, \"I\'ll help you.\"

And so she did, explaining to Harry what everything was. He ended up taking a pile of Chocolate Frogs and some Cauldron Cakes, as they seemed most like the Mars bars he had been craving.

When he opened the Chocolate Frog, deftly snatching it from the air and consuming it in one bite, he eagerly withdrew the card that Pansy had told him would be inside.

The picture was of an ancient-looking man with long, silvery hair and beard, as well as deep blue eyes behind distinctive half-moon spectacles. As Pansy had told him, the small portrait was moving, which greatly fascinated Harry. What caught his eye just as quickly was the man\'s name, as he\'d heard it uttered by Draco and Theodore several times.

*Albus Dumbledore*

Intrigued, Harry read the short description below Dumbledore\'s twinkly-eyed portrait.

*Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Albus Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\'s blood, and for his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten-pin bowling.*

So this was the Dumbledore who Draco and Theodore spoke of. Odd how they seemed to speak so poorly of a man who seemed to be regarded so highly and who had seemingly done a number of great deeds.

But he had no doubt they knew far more than he, so Harry didn\'t ponder the matter long. He quickly went back to his mountain of chocolate and impromptu lesson in the art of poker.

The only other real thing of note that happened during the rest of the journey did not take place until several hours after Harry had learned of Albus Dumbledore.

It happened when the door burst open yet again, admitting a girl who was already dressed in her Hogwarts robes. One with perhaps the bushiest brown hair Harry had ever seen, as well as very distinctive teeth, some of which were too large and out of alignment.

\"Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville\'s lost one.\"

Pansy seemed to cringe at the mere idea of a toad, and Theodore sneered. Harry noticed that Theodore sneered quite a bit.

When none of Harry\'s new friends seemed inclined to answer, he did so himself. Somehow, he didn\'t find this girl nearly as intimidating as anyone else he\'d met that day.

\"We haven\'t seen one, sorry.\"

The girl deflated, but then her eyes fell on the chessboard still laid out and they lit up. \"Is that a magical chessboard? I\'ve heard they move on their own? Have any of you been doing any magic?\"

\"No,\" Theodore bit out tersely.

\"Oh, well, I\'ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\'s all worked for me. Nobody in my family\'s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it\'s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I\'ve heard --- I\'ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough --- I\'m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?\"

Dear Go --- wait! No... Merlin; magicals apparently said Merlin, Diana had told him.

Dear Merlin, this girl was... something.

Something Harry wasn\'t entirely sure he liked, but something nonetheless. He saw no need to flaunt the fact she had read some books. He supposed it was impressive if she really had memorized all of them, but it wasn\'t as if she had done something incredible.

\"People who don\'t want your company,\" Draco drawled in a tone that was shockingly condescending for an eleven-year-old.

She flushed pink and suddenly looked upset. \"There\'s no need to be rude---\"

\"Says the one who doesn\'t know how to knock,\" Theodore sniped. He had a point. Did nobody in this damned world of magic knock? First Hagrid and now Hermione Granger. \"What\'s the matter, Granger? Too busy memorizing textbooks to learn some manners?\"

That might have been a bit harsh, and Harry did feel a definite pang of guilt at the stricken look on Hermione Granger\'s face as she rushed from the compartment, but he didn\'t want to say that to his new friends, and she had been quite annoying.

Really, perhaps it was only right after she\'d barged into their compartment without warning and started flaunting how fast she could read, of all things.

\"That, Potter,\" said Theodore, \"is exactly what the wrong sort looks like.\"

It wasn\'t long after their confrontation with Hermione Granger that a voice came over the speaker and said they would be arriving at Hogwarts in five minutes. They all decided to use that time to change. Harry bowed out to do so in the bathroom; though he didn\'t say that exactly.

He had actually just said he\'d needed to use it for a while now. He was wearing robes, after all, just not his Hogwarts ones. He wanted to ensure they stayed pristine for the night\'s events, but he hadn\'t been willing to show off his usual attire. Thus, he had slipped on some basic wizarding robes in one of the train station\'s bathrooms. Underneath were his battered, second-hand rags. He didn\'t want his friends seeing those, and it terrified him to think how they might react to them. Especially after Draco\'s reaction to his trunk all those hours ago.

By the time he returned to their compartment, Pansy was back as well. All of them had been instructed to leave their luggage on board, so they were now just waiting for the train to come to a halt.

\"What house are you hoping for, Potter?\" asked Theodore, catching Harry a bit off guard.

He hesitated, not quite knowing how to answer, but Draco beat him to it.

\"He\'ll be a Slytherin, of course.\"

Theodore snorted. \"A Potter in Slytherin? That would be something to see.\"

\"No Potter has been sorted into Slytherin for centuries,\" Pansy explained when she saw the puzzled expression on Harry\'s face. \"They\'ve nearly all been in Gryffindor.\"

\"You don\'t want to be in Gryffindor,\" Draco pronounced matter of factly. \"They\'re all a bunch of reckless slobs who try and get themselves killed just so they can go brag about it to their friends.\"

Harry frowned. \"But my parents must have been Gryffindors.\"

This made Draco come up short, but it was Pansy who made the save. \"What Draco means is that *almost* all of them are like that. There are obviously a few here and there who have some sense, but most of them are rowdy simpletons.\"

\"Not to mention mudbloods and blood traitors,\" Theodore muttered. Harry had no idea what either of those things meant, so he stayed quiet, thinking of all the things his new friends had told him.

He supposed the house of the brave could lend itself to recruiting some rather rambunctious individuals. He could see how an entire house of people like that could be problematic if they were all stuck together.

He shuddered at what that house might look like if Pansy and Draco were right. He also didn\'t know the meaning of whatever Theodore had said, but the word \'traitor\' did not have positive connotations. He had already been betrayed by family in his opinion. The last thing he wanted was to be betrayed again.

And thus, Harry decided he didn\'t want to be in Gryffindor.

Soon, they had all exited the train.

The thick veil of clouds above had thinned; though it hardly mattered now, for it was by this point dark. The clouds that remained still did an excellent job of obstructing the moon, seeming to do their best to impede it every time it tried to beam its silvery light down onto the Earth below.

A booming voice called out to the first years, and they were all led to a fleet of boats by Hagrid, unmistakable and impossible to miss even in the dark gloom of this night. Harry could not help but notice the way Hagrid\'s face had twisted into an obvious look of concern when his dark, beady eyes had fallen upon him, as well as Draco, Theodore, and Pansy.

The four of them piled into a boat, leaving Crabbe and Goyle to find one of their own. They sailed across the eerily smooth surface of the dark, vast lake which carried them down into a sort of underground docking station.

Before that could happen, they caught their first glimpse of Hogwarts. Harry didn\'t even try to conceal his awe and wonder; he knew doing so would be fruitless.

The castle dominated the very sky, standing tall and imposing on the dark, high cliff they were about to sail straight under. In the velvety blackness, the castle was effectively camouflaged by the impenetrable night around it. It might have even gone relatively unnoticed that night, despite its size and grandeur, had it not been for the hundreds of lights shining from its many windows. Every one of them stood out on this dark, gloomy night, clashing with the darkness as starkly as a blinding supernova might against the all-consuming nothingness of a gaping black hole.

They drew the attention of all, casting the nearby bits of the castle into sharp relief so that they could make out its magnificent form, even on such a night.

Many of the first years thought the castle looked more like an impenetrable fortress built to stand against the sieges of vengeful dragons and vindictive deities as opposed to a boarding school built to house the best and the brightest witches and wizards of the United Kingdom. Not that the fact did anything to dim their excitement. It seemed only to amplify it as the children practically scrambled up the sloping grounds to the castle\'s towering, oak front doors.

Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked thunderously upon the door three times, prompting it to be opened not ten seconds later by a tall, thin woman in plain black robes. Harry thought she looked very stern and he immediately noted her as not being the type to cross if he could at all avoid it.

\"The firs\' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid.

\"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\"

The entrance hall was so vast, the whole of the Dursleys\' house could have fit inside of it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase that faced them led to the upper floors.

They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right --- the rest of the school must already have been present --- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small antechamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.

Professor McGonagall gave them all a rousing speech about the four Hogwarts houses and the mysterious sorting ceremony that awaited them.

Well, not so mysterious at all, since Draco quickly explained to Harry in a low whisper exactly how the students were sorted, which made a red-headed boy\'s ramblings about fighting a troll several minutes later all the more amusing.

The Deputy Headmistress temporarily left them after a not-so-subtle hint to look sharp in a few minutes\' time. She had definitely been glaring at the same red-head who\'d mentioned the troll, for he had an obvious smudge of... something on his long, distinct nose. Then again, that was better than the boy who had almost lost his toad. His cloak had been fastened under his ear. How he had ever accomplished such a thing, Harry would never know. It was oddly impressive, in a depressing sort of way.

Harry and many of the others got a horrible scare when numerous transparent beings, who were apparently ghosts, floated through the wall. Harry did think he remembered something about them in *Hogwarts, A History,* but he hadn\'t read a terribly large amount of that book yet. Only the relevant section about the barrier Diana had indicated, and some other miscellaneous passages here and there.

It wasn\'t long before Professor McGonagall returned and ushered the ghosts out of the antechamber. Harry tried hard not to gawk as they floated straight through the wall once more while he lined up and did his best to mentally prepare himself for what was to come.

He felt as though his legs had turned to lead as they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall proper.

Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table clearly designated for the professors

Professor McGonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars.

It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all and that the Great Hall didn\'t simply open onto the heavens.

Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool, she positioned a pointed wizard\'s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia certainly would never have let it in the house.

Harry thought it looked too battered to do much of anything, let alone sort them all into one of the four houses.

As if to prove him wrong, a brim on the ancient hat opened wide, and it began to sing a song. A song describing the houses in more flamboyant terms than McGonagall had just moments earlier.

The hat preached their values before bowing to each of the four tables and falling still once more. The last thing Harry heard before Professor McGonagall called the first name was the tall, gangly red-head cursing under his breath and promising to kill the older brother who had somehow gotten him to believe they would be fighting a troll.

People really were thick. Harry had been in the magical world for all of a month and even he wouldn\'t have fallen for that.

\"Abbot, Hannah!\"

Harry became distracted when the first name was called. A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat --- which fell right down over her eyes --- and sat down. A moment\'s pause\...

\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" the hat shouted.

The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table.

\"Bones, Susan!\"

\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" the hat shouted again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.

\"Boot, Terry!\"

\"RAVENCLAW!\"

The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.

\"Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers. Perhaps it was Harry\'s imagination, or perhaps all Draco and Theodore had said about the Gryffindors was playing tricks on his mind, but they looked like an awfully loud and rowdy bunch --- to the point of being overwhelming and borderline unbearable.

Harry shuddered; he liked his peace and quiet when he needed it.

\"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin, and Harry noticed their reaction was very polite, but a whole lot more subdued. This seemed more like a place he wouldn\'t mind staying, though much the same could be said for Ravenclaw, whose members had reacted in an equally acceptable way for their own new housemates.

He was definitely starting to feel sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during P.E at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.

And the sorting itself...

Merlin, what if he were sorted into Gryffindor? They didn\'t look his type and he had the oddest feeling he would immediately lose his newly-formed friendships. He didn\'t think he would be able to stand such a thing happening. It was the first time in many years he\'d had friends at all, and he didn\'t want to think how painful it would be to lose them so quickly and so suddenly.

He supposed Ravenclaw wouldn\'t be too bad, but the Hufflepuffs seemed to do a lot of hugging and touching to greet their new members. All of that was a very big no for Harry.

He began to notice the inconsistencies of the hat when it took several minutes to sort Hermione Granger into Gryffindor, yet Daphne Greengrass --- quite a tall blonde girl with icy blue eyes and soft, angelic features --- was sorted into Slytherin within thirty seconds of her donning the hat. Draco had gone to Slytherin before the hat had even touched his head, joining Crabbe and Goyle at the silver and green table.

Theodore was sorted almost as quickly as Draco, and Pansy didn\'t take much time, either. A pair of twins --- Patil and Patil --- were sorted next and then, at long last...

\"Potter, Harry!\"

As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.

\"Potter, did she say?\"

\"*The* Harry Potter?\"

\"Better be Gryffindor!\"

The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second, he was looking at the black inside of the hat.

He waited...

\'Hmm,\' said a small voice in his ear. \'Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind, either. Quite a great one, as a matter of fact, if it is just applied in the right way... yes, plenty of potential here. There\'s talent, ah, my goodness, yes --- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\'s interesting... So where shall I put you?\'

Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, \'Not Gryffindor, not Gryffindor---\'

\'Not Gryffindor?\' the hat asked in what seemed to be an utterly incredulous voice. \'Now *that* is most interesting of all things. A Potter not wanting to go to Gryffindor? I would have never thought I would see the day. Hmm... this makes things difficult. Are you quite sure not Gryffindor? It is the most natural fit, and it is by far your safest option. You would do very well there; of that, I have no doubt.\'

Harry thought about his parents very briefly and what they might think of him if he weren\'t sorted into Gryffindor. He crushed that thought quickly. If they wouldn\'t accept him no matter what house he landed in, they were no better than the Dursleys, which was a possibility he could not bear to consider. He had to believe they would have been accepting of any option.

\'Oh yes, your parents would have been most happy no matter what, I assure you. Your father definitely didn\'t love Slytherins in his younger years, but he grew out of such foolish notions in time. Your mother was once great friends with a Slytherin.\'

That did it.

\'Slytherin?\' the hat asked through a chuckle. \'My, my, you really do want to shake up the masses, don\'t you? Hmm... Slytherin, quite the risk. Much could happen, but... hm... yes, You could be great, it\'s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that. Yes, quite a risky choice, but with great risk comes great rewards. Tread carefully, Harry Potter, and I wish you the best of luck in \"SLYTHERIN!\"

**Author\'s Endnote:**

**The games have begun and I think it is already apparent how a canon-ish Harry who is naive, vulnerable, and desperate for friendship reacts to the introduction of a new group of friends. I honestly believe this is pretty much how it would have gone if Harry had accepted Draco\'s offer. He really did just latch onto the first people who showed him kindness. In this story, that just so happened to be the Malfoys.**

**Also, yes, I am using heirs, lords, and have a political system. I assure you that Harry won\'t be dipping his toes into politics beyond *maybe*** **some very basic in-house stuff for many years. No eleven-year-old political masterminds here. That will be left to the adults.**

***The Great Hall at Hogwarts***

***9:43 PM***

A heavy and impenetrable silence more total and absolute than most present had ever experienced fell over the Great Hall as soon as the hat had uttered its final syllable. The dumbstruck expressions that marred most faces dotted throughout the room might have led one to believe that an otherworldly deity had appeared in the hall\'s centre and suddenly revealed the deepest, darkest secrets of the universe. Secrets the likes of which mere humans could simply never comprehend.

Harry felt every decibel, or lack thereof, as he stood and made his way towards the Slytherin table, trying to look as though the reaction of the hall hadn\'t fazed him. Each of his footsteps echoed ominously against the ancient stone floor no matter how lightly he trod. Harry fancied that he could hear his own breath and heartbeat as he drew ever nearer to the table bedecked in green and silver.

Just as he was sure he would reach the Slytherin table before a peep escaped from the masses --- who seemed to somehow be imprisoning all sound in the world --- a single, steady set of hands began to clap. Harry realized that the set of weathered hands belonged to the same twinkly-eyed man he had seen on the back of that chocolate frog card on the way to Hogwarts.

It was Albus Dumbledore.

Very slowly and with the hesitation one might expect of a particularly frightened skydiver, the hall began to clap. Harry could not help but notice how muted the applause seemed. Not only compared to the likes of that which had come before it, but even to the tumultuous muttering that had followed him up to the spindle-legged stool.

\"Rivers, Oliver!\" called Professor McGonagall, obviously and successfully attempting to draw the majority of the hall\'s attention away from Harry, who was beginning to noticeably fidget as he took his seat at the end of the Slytherin table.

All of the first years were at the far left end of the table, as it was the only spot that seemed to have been left for them and none of the older students seemed to be moving.

The seating order was obviously alphabetical, with Bulstrode and Crabbe at the very end sitting across from one another and the others following to their right in ascending alphabetical order. Harry sat directly across from Pansy Parkinson and beside Theodore Nott, who sat across from a small, timid-looking blonde girl named Lillian Moon.

\"RAVENCLAW!\" shouted the hat, pulling Harry forcefully from his observations and thrusting his psyche roughly back into reality with a resounding jolt.

\"Well done, Harry!\" congratulated Pansy, beaming at him as though he had just been awarded the Order of Merlin, First Class.

Harry barely had the energy to respond, choosing instead to simply nod along, allowing the ever-building exhaustion brought on by the night\'s events to seep out of him, yet still somehow managing to look somewhat composed.

Draco looked extremely smug. \"As if there was ever any doubt,\" he drawled. \"I did tell both of you he would be in Slytherin, didn\'t I?\"

\"You did,\" admitted Theodore, \"but the Potters have been Gryffindors for centuries. We just had to make sure the apple wouldn\'t fall right under the same tree.\"

\"Such a lack of faith. You should put some trust in me, Nott. Things might run smoother that way.\"

Theodore scowled and shook his head just as the final boy to be sorted --- Blaise Zabini, a tall, dark-skinned boy with sharp, slanted features --- joined them at the Slytherin table. Before the conversation could continue, the man from the chocolate frog card had taken to his feet; his arms were outstretched as though to embrace the lot of them, who had all fallen silent as soon as he\'d made his stand.

\"Welcome,\" he said. \"Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!\"

The man retook his seat, but Harry was hardly focused on that. His attention was effectively captured by the hundreds of plates of food that had appeared on all tables. Heaps of pasta, piles of potatoes, stacks of roast beef, and mounds of pork chops, chicken, and steak, as well as vast numbers of other things that Harry didn\'t know. Many of them he was sure he would never have known, even if the Dursleys hadn\'t been intent on ensuring he ate the bare minimum of a select few choices.

They were, after all, perfectly normal, thank you very much. Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of Number 4 Privet Drive would never have been caught dead eating anything that was even remotely out of the ordinary.

\"Mental,\" muttered Theodore from beside Harry, cutting quite ruthlessly into a piece of beef. \"Old codger is losing it.\"

\"Is he... a bit mad?\" asked Harry.

\"Mad hardly does it justice,\" sneered Draco. \"Father\'s been saying for years anything so great about Dumbledore faded ages ago. He doesn\'t even think he\'s fit to run the school, you know.\"

\"But he beat that dark wizard, didn\'t he?\"

\"Grindelwald, yes,\" Theodore admitted. \"There\'s a lot more to that than was said on the frog card, though. And that was years ago. Dumbledore isn\'t the same man he was when he fought Grindelwald. I doubt he\'s even the same man who fought against the Dark Lord.\"

\"You mean Vol---\"

\"Don\'t say the name,\" Theodore hissed furiously, glancing sharply around the table to ensure nobody had heard him.

It appeared that no one had.

\"Potter, whatever you do, don\'t say that name. There\'s a reason witches and wizards fear speaking it.\"

\"Why do they?\"

Draco and Theodore exchanged veiled looks, but it was Pansy who answered. \"Harry, the Dark Lord was a great wizard. A terrible wizard, but a great one. He did things with magic that most people didn\'t think were possible. Some of the things he did... well, Theodore is right. There is a reason people fear his name. No one ever managed to stand against him. He took on the entire ministry *and* Dumbledore. He might have even won had it not been for you. Even after he attacked you, plenty of people don\'t think he\'s actually dead.\" She glanced nervously around the table to make sure nobody was listening in on them. \"Plenty of people believe he\'ll come back one day.\"

Harry had to resist the urge to shudder. That was ominously similar to what Hagrid had said about Voldemort. How when he wanted somebody dead, they died.

\"*No one ever lived after he decided ter kill \'em, no one except you, an\' he\'d killed some o\' the best witches an\' wizards of the age --- the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts...\"*

Harry remembered yet another thing Hagrid had told him about Voldemort. Another thing that tied into Pansy\'s monologue, and a thing that actually made him shiver.

\"*Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he\'s still out there, bidin\' his time, like, but I don\' believe it. People who were on his side came back ter ours. Some of \'em came outta kinda trances. Don\' reckon they could\'ve done if he was comin\' back.*

*\"Most of us reckon he\'s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on.\"*

The two sentiments were eerily similar, just with one, glaring difference.

Hagrid had been sure Voldemort was powerless and for all intents and purposes --- finished.

Pansy, Draco, and Theodore seemed much less sure of that fact, and it caused the hairs on the back of Harry\'s neck to stand on end.

Or perhaps that was the intense stare he could feel, practically burning a hole in the back of his skull.

He glanced up to the staff table and quickly located the source of the stare. It was coming from a man who was speaking with Professor Quirrell --- still adorned in the same ridiculous-looking turban he had worn in the Leaky Cauldron. This other man wore far more standard-looking black robes. He was thin and sallow-skinned, with long, greasy hair as black as night and deep, intense eyes as dark as endless tunnels. Where Hagrid\'s black eyes seemed to emanate warmth, this man\'s radiated the opposite and drew all warmth into them, as if they were gaping chasms or vast, black holes.

The man turned away from Quirrell for but a second to meet Harry\'s own eyes, and a white-hot stab of pain shot across his scar like the very bolt of lightning it was shaped after.

\"Ouch!\"

\"What is it?\" asked Draco.

\"N-nothing.\"

The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher\'s look --- a feeling that he didn\'t like Harry at all.

\"Who\'s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\"

If any of his new friends were surprised he knew Quirrell, they didn\'t say it. \"That\'s Professor Snape,\" said Draco. \"He\'s our Head of House and Hogwarts\' Potions Master.\" The boy smirked maliciously. \"He\'s supposed to be terribly biased towards us. I can\'t wait to see how our first Potions lesson goes.\"

Harry nodded along slowly, much less enthusiastic to spend time with this man than Draco.

He was sure Snape intensely disliked him, even if Harry had absolutely no idea why that might be. It wasn\'t as if he had done anything to the man.

Harry spent the rest of the meal mostly in silence, ignoring the concerned glances Pansy shot his way every so often. He was content to alternate between watching Snape up at the staff table and listen to the conversations going on around him.

When both dinner and dessert were finished and had vanished from the tables, the venerable Hogwarts Headmaster was on his feet once more, his presence alone commanding complete and absolute silence.

\"Ahem --- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.

\"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\"

Dumbledore\'s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of a set of red-headed twins at the Gryffindor table.

\"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.

\"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.

\"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\"

Many in the hall laughed, but most at the Slytherin table just snorted or shook their heads in disgust at what they obviously viewed as a tasteless joke.

Not Harry.

He didn\'t say it aloud, but he had the oddest, yet most persistent feeling that Professor Dumbledore was being serious.

Deathly serious.

***September 2, 1991***

***The Potions Classroom***

***9:00 AM***

Harry had risen bright and early the day after they had arrived at Hogwarts. He was used to rising early, for it had been expected of him to make the Dursleys breakfast most days.

The Slytherins had all made their way down into the depths of the Hogwarts dungeons after the feast on that first night and been led through an entrance concealed behind a brick wall that slid aside like a muggle sliding door when the correct password was spoken.

Their common room was dark with a low ceiling, and the walls appeared to be hewn straight from ancient stone. Except for the centrally-located fire blazing merrily at what seemed to be all times of the day and night, the lone lights in the common room were bright green orbs that seemed to cast a pale, ghostly light over the room. It added to the haunting feel brought on by the dark view they had out into the lake outside, as well as the long, deep shadows that the lights sent flickering across the walls.

On either side of the common room, dark tunnels lit by torches led off to the dorms and bathrooms. Each year had its own dorm section, and within each section were a number of rooms which each housed two students.

Draco had offered to bunk with Harry, who had readily accepted. That left Theodore Nott with the Zabini boy, and Crabbe with Goyle on the boys\' side. Daphne Greengrass bunked with Tracey Davis, while Pansy had practically demanded her own room, seeing as there was an odd number of females. Bulstrode and Moon hadn\'t objected, choosing to bunk together and leave Pansy the privacy she had so clearly desired.

Harry had taken the bed nearest the door, leaving Draco to the one nearest the small porthole that looked out into the lake. He had been asleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow; though he\'d had the oddest dream of Professor Snape, a talking turban, and a flash of green light; though he hadn\'t remembered it when he had awoken that next morning.

Draco had still been fast asleep, as had the others, so Harry had decided to go out and explore the castle.

He hadn\'t really found much aside from the Potions classroom and Professor Snape\'s office, but it was a start.

The former actually came in quite useful.

After breakfast with his friends, who had been mildly worried about where he\'d run off to, they were all given timetables. Their first class would be Potions with the Gryffindors, so Harry had led the way down into the dungeons and to the classroom he had found earlier that day. He sat with Draco, while Theodore sat with Pansy one row in front of them.

Draco had wanted to sit in the front row, but Harry had insistently refused to sit anywhere but in the back. The idea of people behind him was something he was not at all comfortable with. This had made no sense to Draco, but he had eventually accepted. It wasn\'t as if it made a world of difference to him.

Most of the first-year Slytherin contingent was present in the classroom before the first Gryffindor not named Hermione Granger arrived, though none dared to be late. The tall, red-headed boy who had been going on about a troll and his sandy-haired companion had cut it close, but they had just made it.

The door slammed open not ten seconds after they had taken their seats, and Professor Snape strode into the room with his robes billowing as if caught in a non-existent wind.

It was quite the image.

He started class by taking the attendance and his dark eyes paused when they reached Harry\'s name. \"Ah, yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new... celebrity.\"

Nobody dared to make a sound as Harry fruitlessly fought against his fast-rising blush. Snape studied all of them with his dark, tunnel-like eyes before his monologue began.

\"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making.\" He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word. Snape had the gift of keeping a class quiet without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\'t expect you will truly understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses\... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death --- if you aren\'t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\"

More silence followed this little speech. Harry sat stock-still, not willing to do so much as move. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she was not, in fact, a dunderhead.

\"Potter!\" said Snape suddenly. \"What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\"

Harry had no idea.

He knew what both ingredients were, but he had never heard of combining them. It was odd. Harry had read most of the first-year section of his textbook, but couldn\'t for the life of him remember any potion that combined the two ingredients. Everyone else in the room looked stumped, too; sans Daphne Greengrass, who looked strangely surprised. Even Granger no longer looked so eager, seeming much more put out and a whole lot more apprehensive now than she had a moment earlier.

\"I don\'t know, sir,\" Harry admitted quietly, trying not to redden even more than he already had whilst Snape had taken the attendance.

The professor\'s lips curled into a sneer. \"Tut, tut --- clearly, fame isn\'t everything.\" He was obviously trying quite hard not to smirk. \"Let\'s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\"

Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry knew the answer to this one, small mercy though it was.

\"In the stomach of a goat, Professor.\"

Snape\'s jaw seemed to tighten. \"Indeed you would. You should have no problem then, Potter, in telling me exactly what a bezoar is?\"

\"It\'s a small stone that forms from the goat\'s bodily fluids, sir. It cures most poisons.\"

Hermione Granger hadn\'t even had the chance to raise her hand that time, and she appeared very put out about it.

Snape\'s expression did not change. \"Correct,\" he said silkily. \"And what, Potter, is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?\"

Granger stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling. Harry noticed that Draco, Theodore, and Pansy were all glaring at her for a reason he couldn\'t entirely decipher. He supposed it was a bit rude to assume he wouldn\'t be able to answer, but if looks could kill...

\"There\'s no difference, sir. They\'re the same plant. I think it\'s also called aconite.\"

Snape looked oddly cross and he whirled on Granger. \"Sit down!\" he snapped, and she fell back into her seat with the swiftness of one commanded by a drill sergeant. \"Three points from Gryffindor for your deplorable behaviour, Granger. I would expect any civilized child with an ounce of dignity to remain in their seats while class is proceeding, and to not attempt to steal the praise of their classmates like a pathetic pet begging its owner for scraps.\"

Granger briefly looked as though she might actually cry, and Draco, Theodore, and Pansy were caught up in fits of laughter. Harry didn\'t join in, but he didn\'t laugh very often, anyway.

\"Weasley,\" snapped Snape, \"what exactly is the plant I have just mentioned?\"

\"Uh... aconite, sir?\"

\"Not the name of it, Weasley. What is it? What are its properties?\"

The boy flushed as red as his hair as many of the Slytherins laughed. Harry could not help but grin, though he hid it behind his hand.

\"I dunno, sir.\"

\"Speak up, Weasley. I couldn\'t hear you.\"

\"I don\'t know, sir.\"

\"Shame. For your information, aconite, otherwise known as monkshood and wolfsbane, is a leafy and poisonous variety of plant that is particularly dangerous and quite difficult to detect. Powdered root of asphodel when added to an infusion of wormwood creates a sleeping potion so powerful it is aptly named the Draught of the Living Death. The other questions were answered by Potter, and I will not repeat him. Well?\" Snape barked. \"Why aren\'t any of you writing this down?\"

Harry couldn\'t help but notice, ten minutes later, when Draco and Pansy were each rewarded with five points to Slytherin for answering questions far simpler than his own.

He hadn\'t been awarded so much as a point, and he was quite sure the Draught of Living Death was not a first-year potion.

***Later that afternoon, in the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom...***

After Potions, the Slytherins had attended Charms, which was taught by a diminutive man named Professor Flitwick. He was so short, he needed to stand on a stack of books just to see over his desk.

That class was nowhere near as eventful as Potions.

Professor Flitwick had fallen off his stack of books when reading Harry\'s name aloud and he had made some objects fly around the room at high speeds. Outside of that, he had covered the year\'s curriculum and mostly spent time going over safety precautions.

After Charms, they had lunch and then one of the classes Harry was most looking forward to.

Defence Against the Dark Arts.

It was by far the strangest classroom he had seen up to this point, though he supposed a man who marched around in a purple turban with no apparent justification would inevitably have his eccentricities.

It was a stiflingly hot room, with the windows veiled and the walls lit by floating spheres of magical light --- similar in colour to the ones that hung in the Slytherin common room. Everything seemed to smell vaguely of garlic despite the presence of a vast number of burning incenses. Pansy told them that Quirrell was apparently afraid of a vampire he\'d fought off while on his travels the previous year.

When they had all taken their seats, Professor Quirrell began to speak and Harry found himself taken aback.

The horrible stutter the man had been plagued with back in Diagon Alley was gone as though it had never existed, and his low, smooth tones were spoken with what sounded to Harry like a shocking amount of confidence.

It was such a drastic shift that it left his head spinning.

Or perhaps that was the smell of garlic or the odd pain that seemed to be emanating from the scar on his forehead, of all things; it was impossible to tell.

\"Welcome to your first lesson in Defence Against the Dark Arts. The single most important class you will attend while at this school, since it is the only class that can prepare you for any and all situations you might one day find yourselves trapped in.\"

Professor Flitwick had also made valid arguments about the validity of his own subject by preaching its versatility. He had said it had roots in all sorts of things from duelling to household upkeep, and everything in between.

But to Harry, Quirrell\'s point was far more compelling.

He knew all too well what it was like to feel helpless in situations one would rather not be in, and that opening line drew his complete and undivided attention.

\"In order to defend yourself against something, you must first understand what exactly it is that is attacking you in the first place. In this instance, you must know what the Dark Arts truly are. According to the Ministry of Magic, the Dark Arts are any number of magics that they deem to be illegal.\" Harry couldn\'t help but notice the obvious distaste Quirrell used to state that fact. \"According to the more educated among us, the Dark Arts are powerful magic that is used with the intent to harm, maim, or even kill. The ministry\'s classification is categorically flawed since I could cause great harm --- and even potential death --- with a wide number of spells that they are perfectly happy for each and every one of you to learn while at this school.\"

That... was a shockingly valid point, actually.

\"The Dark Arts are a monstrous branch of magic. A branch of magic that is so vast and ever-evolving that it is likely you will often be completely unaware of what exactly you are fighting. The best way to defend yourself against the Dark Arts is by having as many different ways of defending yourself as possible. The more complex and multi-layered your defence, the better chance you stand at defending yourself against magics that are quintessentially complex and intrinsically multi-layered themselves. In what I would like to think is my own, well-educated opinion, I think a spell often isn\'t made by how much damage it can cause, or how well it defends against a potentially damaging spell. I think it is, or, more aptly, should be measured by how many ways it can cause damage, or how many ways it can protect you.

\"But when speaking about things so naturally complex, I\'m afraid we must slow down. Complex structures don\'t appear overnight. If they did, they would crack, crumble, and never be seen again. They are built on sound foundations, and that is the only way they will continue to stand at all. This is no different. This year, I will be helping you to build foundations as solid as I can so that, as you continue your education, you can continue to expand upon them and one day hopefully have defences as flexible as the arts that would seek to undo them.

\"Now, I will be teaching you a very basic spell for today\'s purpose. You will all have no trouble with it. It isn\'t the most useful of spells, but today, we will be working on hitting your target and, if you just so happen to be the target, not getting hit. Now, pair up and we shall begin.\"

And so they did.

They were taught the Stinging Hex, which gave Harry no trouble at all. He even managed to cast it on his first try. Theodore and Zabini had as well, and Draco and Davis had got the spell to work on their second. What was marginally more difficult were the drills Quirrell put them all through, but Harry did well.

He had spent enough time dodging in his life to have the basic principles down. Watch the chest of your opponent to see which way they might move, and then react. His aim was accurate and he managed to hit more targets than anyone else, except for maybe Zabini, though Theodore wasn\'t terribly far behind him.

By the time the class had ended, Harry was exceedingly eager to learn more.

So eager, in fact, that he planned to rush off to the library at his earliest convenience.

***September 3, 1991***

***Greenhouse I***

***9:00 AM***

Much of the ostensibly impenetrable layer of clouds that had veiled the earth two days before had cleared by the time Harry and his classmates made their way down to the greenhouses on their second morning at Hogwarts, eagerly awaiting their first-ever lesson in Herbology. Harry and Draco walked down the sloping lawns with Pansy and Theodore off to either side, and Crabbe and Goyle flanking the procession a step or two behind. They oddly looked as though they were bodyguards for some sort of illustrious group of high-ranking officials.

The first-year contingent from Ravenclaw was waiting for them by the time they reached the greenhouses, as was a short, dumpy woman named Professor Sprout. She had flyaway hair that was beginning to grey and a kind-looking face. She led them all into the greenhouse before telling them to group up in fours at each table. Harry, Draco, Pansy, and Theodore took one together, and the class began in earnest.

\"Welcome to your first lesson in Herbology, everyone. I am Professor Sprout and I will be your instructor for at least the next five years, depending on your grades and decisions after you sit your O.W.L exams at the end of your fifth year. I am the Head of Hufflepuff House, but my door is always open to any who would like to ask me anything at any time. You are all always welcome.

\"Now, Herbology. I see that many of you seem to already have preconceived notions about my class. Many students walk into these greenhouses and wonder what could possibly be so important about leafy plants and colourful flowers. Some of them even think this class is a joke, or they take it lightly. Outside of its obvious applications in Potions --- a subject with a much more well-established reputation --- Herbology is among the most taxing and potentially even dangerous magic you will perform while at this school.\"

Several students snickered. Pansy was among them, though she hid it well behind her hand.

Instead of looking upset, Professor Sprout simply looked indulgently amused. \"Yes, the exact reaction I expected. Those who want to enroll in the Auror corps must take this class through their seventh year, you know?\" When the reaction didn\'t change, she sighed. \"Very well. Who can tell me the name of a plant that might kill a witch or wizard if they get too close?\"

That shut them all up at once. Harry could hear no snickering now.

\"Miss Greengrass?\" indicated the professor.

\"Devil\'s Snare, ma\'am.\"

\"Correct, take three points to Slytherin. Can anyone tell me what Devil\'s Snare is?\" She pointed out a small, Asian girl from Ravenclaw. \"Yes, Miss Li?\"

\"It\'s a plant that will strangle anyone or anything that touches it, Professor.\"

\"Indeed it is, Miss Li. Take three points for Ravenclaw. Can anyone tell me how to defend against it?\"

Greengrass raised her hand at once, but Sprout waited to see if anybody else could answer. After a great deal of hesitation, Theodore raised his own hand. \"Fire?\" he answered without much confidence.

\"Not a complete answer, but that would work, yes. Take two more points to Slytherin. Miss Greengrass, would you care to explain the full answer?\"

\"Devil\'s Snare can only survive in damp, dark climates. Light will drive it away and fire will actually kill it.\"

\"Correct, another three points. Yes, I hoped that would prove to you that Herbology is no laughing matter. If you are not all very careful when dealing with some of the plants we will be handling much later in your education, disaster could strike. I need your undivided attention at all times in this class, and you must do as I instruct. Am I understood?\"

They all nodded and the lesson went on.

Herbology was followed by History of Magic, which utterly failed to live up to any expectations Harry had for the class.

He had been, and still was, very interested in the subject and he had actually spent a considerable amount of his summer reading the textbook associated with History.

Yet the class proved to be a complete and utter waste of time, in Harry\'s opinion.

Professor Binns had been very old when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up the next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him.

Ever since that fateful day --- and likely long before --- Binns doomed all of his students to a guaranteed five years of completely consistent monotony. He had the most monotone voice one could possibly imagine, and he spent the entirety of Harry\'s first class of History of Magic reading from a comically long roll of parchment that stretched down to the floor and unravelled several feet in front of him. He never looked up, not once, and he failed to notice when half of the class either began whispering to each other, started sleeping, or began to play games like wizard\'s chess. Nothing changed until the end of the class, at which point he promptly rolled up his parchment and floated straight through the wall and out of the classroom without so much as a backwards glance.

Harry was beyond disappointed and he hoped his next class would not disappoint him in the same way this one had.

After lunch, the first-year Slytherins got to experience yet another class Harry was greatly looking forward to. Aside from Defence Against the Dark Arts, it was probably the one he was most excited for --- Transfiguration.

Professor McGonagall was waiting for all of them when they entered the room; her countenance as strict-looking as it had been at the welcoming feast, if not even more so. She waited, rhythmically tapping her foot against the floor until the bell rang to signify the start of her class. With a lazy flick of her wand, the door softly closed, and the lesson began.

\"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\" she said. \"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\" With another wave of her wand, she transformed her desk into a pig before effortlessly reverting it back again. \"Can any of you tell me which branches of Transfiguration I just used?\"

Several of them raised their hands, and Harry took no small amount of pleasure in being the first whose hand hit the air. He had spent quite some time studying this subject, after all.

\"Master Potter?\"

\"Transformation and untransfiguration, Professor.\"

\"Correct; three points to Slytherin. Can you tell me which branch was associated with which action?\"

\"Transformation with turning the desk into a pig, untransfiguration for turning it back.\"

\"Correct, take another two points. Yes, as I have hinted, there are branches involved in the overarching form of magic that is Transfiguration. Transformation, untransfiguration, vanishment, and conjuration.

\"Transformation is the branch of magic concerned with turning one thing into another. Just like, as Master Potter has said, turning my desk into a pig. Untransfiguration is concerned with not only reversing transfigurations, but also in recognizing that they have been applied in the first place. This is more difficult and will not be spoken upon until later years.

\"Speaking of which, conjuration is the magic concerned with making something exist that was not there before.\" McGonagall waved her wand, sending a flock of brightly coloured birds soaring around the room. \"Vanishment,\" she continued sharply, \"is the magic that allows you to make objects disappear.\" She swished her wand, and the vibrant colours were gone as quickly as the birds, leaving not even a feather to signify they had once existed at all.

\"In your initial years at Hogwarts, you will almost exclusively be working with transformation and, in rare instances, untransfiguration. Conjuration and vanishment are focused on in your N.E.W.T years, assuming that you score highly enough in your O.W.L examinations to be permitted to continue in this class. Yes, Miss Davis?\"

Tracey Davis had raised her hand into the air, and McGonagall had finished her monologue before pointing promptly to the girl in question. \"Professor, I read something about sub-branches. Can you explain a little bit about those?\"

\"Briefly, yes. They will also be touched on much later. A sub-branch is a branch of a branch, for lack of a better phrase. For example, transformation is a branch of Transfiguration. Human to animal transfiguration would be a branch of transformation, making it a sub-branch of Transfiguration. There are deeper concepts, as well, but they will not be covered until your later years. They are called nano-branches and femto-branches. An example of this would be, say, mammal to reptile transformations. Does that answer your question, Miss Davis?\"

\"Yes, Professor. Thank you.\"

McGonagall nodded curtly before proceeding to begin a long lecture on standard safety procedures, as well as the course curriculum for this and future years. Had it not been for the fact they had a double period, Transfiguration would have been yet another class in which they performed no magic at all.

Mercifully, it *was* a double period, which meant a practical lesson.

\"Keeping all of that in mind,\" Professor McGonagall was saying, \"I believe it is time for you to begin your practical education in my class.\"

She gave her wand another wave. A drawer on her desk slid open and a box floated out of it and landed atop the well-varnished surface before opening.

\"Your task,\" she continued, \"is to transfigure one of these matchsticks into a needle. Do not be discouraged if it isn\'t something you manage. I do not expect any of you to achieve it this period. The instructions are on page eleven of your textbooks. Begin when you are ready.\"

The sound of scraping chairs could be heard as everyone scrambled to their feet. \"I\'ll grab the matchsticks if you find the right page?\"

Draco nodded, reaching for his textbook with a smile. \"Cheers, Harry.\"

A minute or so later, both boys were sitting with their matchsticks poised and their wands at the ready. Harry glanced down at the diagram and description in the textbook, though it was fairly redundant. He really had read a lot about this subject and he remembered everything the diagram showed by heart.

The incantation was Compasatus Verto, and the wand movement was vaguely circular, ending in a sharp jab towards the matchstick.

\"Compasatus Verto,\" Draco drawled, doing mostly as the book instructed.

Nothing happened.

\"Tighter wand movements, Master Malfoy,\" instructed Professor McGonagall, who had been looming nearby. \"The spell will never take at your level unless your wand movements are very precise. They become less and less necessary as you progress in the subject, as is the case for any other.\" She turned her stare on Harry. \"Let\'s see you try, Master Potter.\"

Harry nodded curtly and closed his eyes. He pictured the desired end product, just as the book had described, and let out an exhale of breath just as he drew the perfect wand movement.

\"Compasatus Verto.\"

At first glance, it appeared he\'d had as little success as Draco. When examined more astutely, one would notice that his matchstick had taken on a rather metallic hue.

\"Very impressive,\" the professor congratulated. \"A very strong start and much further than most get on their first attempt. Continue working, gentlemen, and I shall return to you in time.\"

As the lesson drew on, Harry managed to progressively change his matchstick into a needle, though he hadn\'t quite succeeded by the time the end of class drew near. Draco had perhaps made his matchstick a bit pointier, but that was the extent of his success. Theodore had gotten the same, metallic effect Harry had earlier, and Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle had yet to achieve anything at all. As far as Harry could tell, Nott and Davis were the closest ones to him in terms of progress.

Despite his relative success, something just felt... wrong to Harry, as though some unknown impediment was halting his progress.

He went through the motions again but once more, nothing happened. His matchstick was quite pointy and exactly the right colour. He just couldn\'t get the final effects he needed and he had been stuck here for the last ten minutes.

After going through the motions several more times, he felt as though he had identified the problem, though it made absolutely no sense.

He felt like envisioning the final product was... restrictive? It was hard to explain, but he felt as though he could do better.

Closing his eyes and readying his wand just as the class\'s end ticked near, Harry instead imagined the final change taking place. Not that it had taken place, but it physically taking place in a sort of slow-motion in front of his very eyes.

\"Compasatus Verto.\"

Harry knew at once he had succeeded. He could feel the shock emanate from those around him, just as he had been able to masterfully gauge the emotions of muggles for many years whilst at Privet Drive.

When he opened his eyes, he found himself completely unsurprised to find a perfect needle in front of him and he could not help but smile. Not for the praise Professor McGonagall showered him with, nor even the points given to Slytherin House. He smiled because he knew that he had just gotten to the bottom of his troubles and suspected he had just made a major breakthrough. He would confirm with the several matchsticks he borrowed from Professor McGonagall to practice with, but he was quite sure he was right.

***September 5, 1991***

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***7:21 PM***

The first years had performed their first practical charm work of the year that afternoon, though it had been remarkably easy and the furthest thing from impressive. They had all been set to work on both the spell to summon light --- Lumos --- and the spell to change the colour of objects --- Colovaria. Harry had performed both of these without effort, as had Draco, Pansy, and Theodore.

The most exciting thing to happen that day hadn\'t been during Charms.

That had been when Harry and the others entered the Slytherin common room after dinner to find the first major notice of significance hung on the wall. It was drawing quite the commotion and crowds of people were herded around it. Crabbe and Goyle had taken the lead, barreling through anybody who stood in front of them and letting their less bulky friends trail in their wake.

Draco looked oddly smug about the whole thing.

When they neared the notice board, it was finally evident what had drawn everybody\'s attention.

They would be having their first flying lesson of the year in exactly one week. It would take place out on the grounds with the first-year Gryffindors.

The latter part of that statement made Harry\'s heart sink.

The rivalry between Gryffindor and Slytherin was very intense. To make matters worse, most of the Gryffindors seemed to think he had betrayed them in some form or another. They all shot him hateful glances any time he drew near and a few of the older members of the house of lions were so bold as to fire minor jinxes at him when he walked by. Crabbe and Goyle had resorted to flanking Harry instead of Draco any time they neared a group of Gryffindors, which had largely prevented any further incidents.

Harry couldn\'t say he was overly thrilled to be spending more than an hour in their presence while riding a broom for the first time. The prospect of flying excited him greatly, but it also made him exceedingly apprehensive. What if he made an absolute fool of himself in front of the entire first-year contingent from Gryffindor?

\"You\'ll be fine,\" said Draco when Harry had asked exactly that. \"Your father was brilliant on a broom, from what I\'ve heard. He played for Gryffindor, and I think he still holds some of the school\'s chaser records.\"

\"Really?\" asked Harry, amazed.

\"Yes, I\'m sure they\'re probably in the trophy room, somewhere.\"

That was when Harry resolved to find the trophy room during what had become his routine early morning explorations.

It was the best perk of being awake long before all the others --- it granted him time to explore the castle he was beginning to love so very much.

When he eventually graduated in seven years\' time, he was determined to have learned every last secret of Hogwarts castle.

***September 6, 1991***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***7:43 PM***

Harry thought it felt good to be of use to people he actually cared for instead of people who treated him like hell. Especially after Draco\'s parents had even included a heaping mound of sweets for him in the packages they\'d sent their children earlier that morning.

The gesture had touched Harry in a way that was hard to describe.

They\'d had Potions again that morning with the Gryffindors and it had been their first actual brewing session of the year. They had been allowed to brew in pairs, which had been a small mercy. Harry knew the content fairly well, but he quickly found out he didn\'t have a knack for brewing potions like he seemed to have for transfiguring matchsticks. Draco was fortunately good at the subject, so he was pretty sure they had done quite well.

Not nearly as well as Greengrass and Davis, however. The former had marched confidently up to the front of the class and submitted her potion with a third of the allotted time remaining, something that had made Harry gape like a fool.

\"Her whole family are geniuses with potions,\" Pansy had told him after the lesson. \"They own a bunch of businesses and the like, but one of them is a major import/export company that specializes in potions and their ingredients. I think Daphne\'s mother actually brews some of the more difficult ones. She\'s probably been teaching her for years. That\'s also why she\'s so good in Herbology.\" Pansy shrugged. \"That and because she\'s a genius.\"

That night after classes, Theodore proposed the six of them go out and practice their jinxes, hexes, and curses. Pansy had politely declined. She said she would rather spend time getting better acquainted with the other girls in her year --- namely the potions prodigy herself, who was the heiress of a Founding Twelve family that owned what was perhaps the most profitable business in the country.

The five boys had bid her farewell and left the common room. The prospect of actually trying magic outside of class sent Harry\'s heart fluttering with excitement, and he hurriedly led his friends to a dungeon classroom he\'d found several days earlier that appeared to have been out of use for quite some time.

\"Don\'t we need targets?\" asked Goyle, frowning deeply at the rather barren-looking classroom.

\"Care to be one?\" Theodore asked.

\"M-me?\"

\"We\'re not going to be using anything deadly, you dolt,\" Draco said with a roll of his eyes. \"We don\'t know anything that good and even if we did, I\'d be surprised if we could actually do it.\" Theodore looked as though he might take that as a challenge, but Goyle acquiesced with a deep gulp.

Harry frowned. This seemed very wrong to him. It seemed like something Dudley would force him to do, but Goyle had agreed and they really weren\'t going to use anything that could actually hurt the larger boy...

\"Care to start, Theodore?\" asked Draco.

\"Certainly.\" Theodore stepped forward and drew his wand with the deliberation one might expect from a gladiator drawing their sword. \"Dolor.\" The Stinging Hex sailed from the tip of his wand and struck Goyle in the chest. He let out a loud yelp and rubbed at the point of impact. \"Thought I\'d start light,\" said Theodore. \"Care to go around? See if we can all do each spell?\"

None of them had any trouble with the Stinging Hex. Goyle got a very mild reprieve when it was his turn to try the spell, at which point Crabbe took the lone jinx. The large boy grunted but gave no other reaction.

This again made Harry frown, but he didn\'t comment.

Crabbe chose the next spell. He chose another simple one --- the Tickling Charm --- and again, none of them had any trouble. Goyle looked even less comfortable being a target for this one, but it didn\'t fill Harry with nearly as much guilt as the Stinging Hex had.

The Jelly-Legs Jinx, Goyle\'s choice, was next. It took him and Crabbe a couple of tries each to get this one, while Harry, Draco, and Theodore had no troubles.

\"Tarantallegra,\" Draco incanted when it was his turn to choose the spell. Goyle\'s legs began moving in a completely out-of-control manner and he wound up falling flat on the floor, which caused Harry to wince before he stepped forward and countered the spell with Finite Incantatem; which served as the counter spell for most minor jinxes and hexes. Actual curses often required specific counterspells, but he doubted any of them knew of any spells like that.

Crabbe and Goyle struggled much more with this spell, but they did eventually get it.

\"You\'re up, Harry,\" said Draco, stepping back with the air of one about to watch a particularly well-publicized firework show.

It was thankful Harry had read as far into his Defence textbook as he had, for many of the more basic spells had already been used.

\"Locomotor Mortis.\"

Light-blue light shot from Harry\'s wand and slammed hard into Goyle, who immediately found his legs stuck together and toppled forward. He was thankfully able to brace himself with his arms.

Theodore whistled. \"Leg-Locker, huh? Not bad; not bad at all.\"

He too stepped forward and aimed, though he looked greatly annoyed when the spell didn\'t take on his first, nor his second attempt. It sort of worked on his third, though Goyle was able to wrench his legs apart with some difficulty. On the fourth, Theodore did manage the spell perfectly, though it took Draco several more tries than that; neither Crabbe nor Goyle could get it to work at all.

Clearly annoyed by his failing, Theodore stabbed his wand towards Crabbe, who had just agreed to take Goyle\'s place after all this time.

\"Petrificus Totalus!\"

Nothing but a purple spark shot from the end of his wand.

\"What is that spell supposed to do?\" asked Harry. It wasn\'t in their first-year Defence Against the Dark Arts textbook.

\"It\'s the Full-Body-Bind,\" Theodore supplied bitterly. \"It\'s a mid-second-year spell, I think.\"

Draco scoffed. \"You think you\'re going to get a second-year spell to work during your first week of first year?\"

\"I know I am.\"

His words were bold, but try as he might, Theodore couldn\'t seem to get the spell to work, even though he was certain he was doing it right. Neither could Draco, for that matter, and Crabbe and Goyle barely tried. They all finally gave up and Harry wasn\'t even going to bother attempting it, if not for Draco.

\"You got the Leg-Locker faster than any of us,\" he pointed out. \"If anyone\'s going to get the spell to work, it\'s you.\"

Theodore looked more than a little bit annoyed by the fact Draco\'s statement was true, but he obviously didn\'t disagree with it, for he nodded curtly and gestured for Harry to try.

\"It\'s a circular motion, right?\"

\"A quick half circle and then a jab towards your opponent,\" said Theodore.

After drawing the wand movement several times, Harry stepped forward with a resolute expression, the steps required to get to his desired result playing over and over again in his mind like a muggle film in slow motion. The method had worked excellently on the number of matchsticks he had borrowed from Professor McGonagall. He could now perform the transformation on his first try, so long as he focused very intently.

\"Petrificus Totalus.\"

A jet of purple light rocketed from the end of his wand and struck Crabbe full in the face. The boy\'s limbs snapped to his sides with an audible sound and he careened forward.

\"Merlin,\" breathed Draco, looking at his friend as though seeing him for the first time. \"You did that on your first try?\"

Harry was blushing deeply now. \"It\'s not that big of a deal,\" he tried, \"it\'s just a spell.\"

Theodore snorted. \"Potter, that\'s a mid-second-year spell and you did it on your first try after a week of magical training. You didn\'t even know about the magical world until July. Merlin only knows what you could do with practice.\"

Theodore no longer looked upset or jealous.

He suddenly looked... intrigued.

\"Prat,\" muttered Draco, firing off a Tickling Charm towards Harry in a good-natured manner.

\"Oi!\" exclaimed Harry as he dodged the spell. \"Watch yourself,\" he said as he fired one back.

Theodore joined the fray a minute later after freeing Crabbe, who immediately joined in with Goyle.

Before they knew it, they were all chasing each other around the room, hurling Tickling Charms this way and that. Anyone walking past the room could have heard their laughter from a corridor away.

It was easily the most fun Harry had ever had. Probably because it marked the first time he was ever just allowed to do something pure and be an actual child.

It was a remarkably good feeling.

**Author\'s Endnote:**

**Sorry for the long AN, but I feel as though it is necessary to avoid a few points of confusion.**

**I have two very quick notes before I make a slightly longer one on Harry\'s current skill level, since I have a feeling they will come up in the reviews otherwise:**

**1 - Master Potter is not a mistake. In British schools --- particularly ones that are either of high class or rather traditional --- the males are referred to as \"master\" until they are eighteen, or seventeen in the wizarding world. I have decided to have all of the older professors call males \"master,\" and the younger ones \"mister,\" since it is slowly starting to become less prominent.**

**2 - Untransfiguration is also not an error. I am aware that the word is horrid, but it is also canon, as is the case for the four branches of Transfiguration theory. There isn\'t a whole lot I can do about Rowling\'s horrible linguistic tastes. Granted, it is perhaps the single most wizarding thing I have ever heard.**

**Now, a note on Harry\'s skill level in this final scene:**

**Harry in canon was by far the best DADA student in his year. He scored an O on the O.W.L. --- which even Hermione couldn\'t do --- and he achieved extra credit with the Patronus Charm. Help or not, he also did very well in the Triwizard Tournament against competitors three years his senior, and he did quite well in the only fair battles we saw him in during canon.**

**I honestly don\'t think it is too outlandish to call Harry a prodigy in Defence Against the Dark Arts canonically, even if he was remarkably average at a lot of other things. This Harry is slightly more talented and quite a bit more studious as well, so I don\'t think him pulling off second-year spells in his best subject is unrealistic.**

**He will eventually be very powerful in this story, but it will be a realistic progression. I just wanted to make a quick note on his current level.**

**Please read and review.**

***September 12, 1991***

***The Grounds of Hogwarts***

***3:30 PM***

It was one of the nicer mornings since the students had arrived at Hogwarts. The sun was protruding out from under its position of rest behind the clouds, casting a soft light upon the lands below. The grass was still green, the leaves had begun to shift colours, and there was the slightest hint of a chill in the air that implied the coming of fast-approaching autumn temperatures. There was little more than a light, whispering breeze, which was all the better, for the last thing Harry wanted whilst riding a broom for the first time was to fly headlong into gale-force winds.

It mattered not how many times Draco reminded him of his father\'s prodigious skill on a broomstick. Harry was not his father, and the last thing he wanted was to make a fool of himself in front of the entirety of Gryffindor House. Draco had persistently told Harry that everything was going to be just fine and that flying really wasn\'t that hard, but Harry hadn\'t dared let his hopes rise too high.

He was excited to fly, just not as much for doing so in front of a house that had quietly ridiculed him ever since his sorting. The last thing he needed was to give them even more ammunition to work with. They were doing just fine without it, in Harry\'s opinion.

Yet still, he was excited to fly. Even more so after his explorations that past weekend, when he had done just as he had vowed to do and found the trophy room he\'d been seeking since the mention of his father\'s Quidditch accolades.

***Four days earlier\...***

Ever since Draco had made mention of it almost three full days ago, Harry had been unable to rid himself of thoughts of his father\'s quidditch trophies.

Yesterday morning, he had ventured out into the castle upon waking just as he had every day since his arrival. What was different about this occasion was that for the first time, he had a purpose. He was going to find the trophy room, which likely contained the first remnants of either of his parents he would ever see. He wondered if there might even be a picture of them. He didn\'t think it was too much to ask for, though he hardly dared to hope.

His search had been unsuccessful that Saturday, but this morning would be different; he was determined to ensure that.

Just as breakfast was drawing near and Harry began to worry he would be late, he found it.

It was a vast, dimly lit room with no windows. Several torches flickered faintly on the walls, casting long, dark shadows across the room and causing the well-polished trophies, medals, and plaques to sparkle entrancingly.

There were awards of any shape and size one could imagine. Medals no larger than necklaces, shining medallions that looked as though they weighed five pounds each, masterfully crafted, creatively shaped trophies whose surfaces shone at the barest caress of light, and plaques taller and wider than Harry.

He was enthralled by the room, as he had never imagined, let alone seen anything like it. If not for his powerful motivations, he might have forgotten why he had come and simply stared on in wonderment at the countless number of both modern and ancient trinkets gathered before him.

He didn\'t forget what had brought him here, so he shook himself out of his dazed state and walked carefully forward, taking great caution not to knock anything over. He did not doubt that even if anything was slightly jostled or misplaced, the Caretaker --- a cantankerous old man named Argus Filch --- would have him scrubbing this and other rooms until the end of time.

Harry searched for some time before he found anything related to the reason he had come. Funnily enough, the first thing he found was not related to his father at all, but his mother.

It was a shining medallion dated June of 1976. His mother had apparently received it for outstanding performances in her O.W.L exam in Charms. Best Harry could work out, she had performed magic well beyond the scope of the examination and had thus been rewarded. Not long later, he found a nearly identical medal for his father, dated from the same time. The only key difference was that he had received it not for Charms, but for Transfiguration.

Harry wondered how magic worked and was transferred. He knew that some traits were linked to one\'s blood and genetic makeup and wondered whether or not magic fell into this categorization. If it did, it might have been possible that his father\'s affinity for Transfiguration had passed onto him, which would explain what seemed to be an aptitude he held for the subject.

Just before the passing of time necessitated his leave, Harry spotted the first major award either of his parents had received, though not for individual accomplishments

It was dated May of 1977, and it was for winning the Quidditch Cup. Apparently, Gryffindor had captured it that year, and his father was listed as one of the chasers. It was a fact that both validated Draco\'s earlier claim and filled Harry\'s chest with an odd warmth that was difficult for him to explain and impossible for him to understand.

***Back in the present...***

For a very brief time, the memory of his father\'s award and the odd surge of warmth had filled Harry with what he now suspected to be delusional confidence.

Now standing on the sloping front lawns of Hogwarts in front of not just his entire year set from Slytherin, but also their Gryffindor counterparts, Harry suddenly didn\'t feel so confident. Draco had tried to break the tension with a jab at the lions for showing up so late, as well as the horrid state of the Hogwarts brooms, but it hadn\'t quite managed to distract Harry from his own internal fears.

\"Don\'t worry so much,\" said Draco with a wave of his hand, \"you\'ll be fine. Granger and Thomas are muggleborns who have never flown in their lives. Besides, if Longbottom\'s grandmother has an ounce of sense, she won\'t have let him anywhere near a broomstick, either.\"

\"Patil and Brown wouldn\'t touch one if their lives depended on it,\" put in Theodore, nodding curtly in the direction of a pretty girl with olive skin and her friend.

\"I doubt Dunbar or Midgeon have done much flying either, if any at all,\" said Pansy, giving Harry a reassuring smile despite the fact she herself looked to be in a state not much better than his own.

Before Harry could worry any more, a middle-aged woman with greying hair, hawkish features, and beady, yellow eyes strode into their midst, demanding their attention with her authoritative presence alone.

\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\"

Harry peered down at the broomstick nearest to him and realized at once that there was some truth to what Draco had been saying. The broom looked ancient and it was clearly battered. Some of the twigs were sticking out at odd angles, and some were so mangled they resembled porcupine quills more closely than what he thought the broomstick should have looked like. It appeared to him as though it would fall apart at any moment, and he could only assume it was magic alone that was holding the weathered old broom together.

The observation didn\'t do Harry\'s nerves any favours.

\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the front, \"and say \'up!\"\'

\"UP!\" everyone shouted.

To his great surprise and immense relief, Harry\'s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. His friends obviously hadn\'t been kidding when they told him others would struggle.

Hermione Granger\'s broom had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville Longbottom\'s hadn\'t moved at all. Harry might have thought brooms acted like horses, reacting positively to a lack of fear, since there was a quiver in Neville\'s voice that only said too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. This logic quickly fell apart as Harry tried to form it though, for he quickly realized he too was nervous; he just hid it much better than the pale, shaky first-year Gryffindor.

Madam Hooch spent the next number of minutes showing them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end before she strode purposefully up the rows of students, firmly correcting their grips as she went. Most had their grips corrected, but Harry was one of the few who didn\'t, something that surprised him. Ronald Weasley had been one of the only others, along with Dean Thomas and a few of the Slytherins. After Draco had been so confident Thomas and some of the others would struggle, Harry\'s faith in what his friend had said started to slowly slip, as one\'s confidence in previous assurances often does in situations of great stress.

The process was furthered still more when Draco was among those who had his mechanics corrected, despite the number of hours he had spent preaching his experience on a broom to Harry and the rest of their group.

\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch. Harry listened intently, ignoring Draco\'s string of muttered curses from beside him. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle --- three --- two---\"

Screams filled the courtyard as Longbottom shot into the sky like a cork before Hooch could finish her count. She called up to the rapidly rising figure, but it was to no avail. If he heard her over his own vocal protestations, Longbottom clearly had neither the confidence nor the ability to try and heed her words. Harry realized he would fall seconds before it happened, but the audible cracking sound that accompanied his forceful grounding still made him cringe along with all of the others.

Madam Hooch bent over Neville, her face nearly as pale as his own as she examined his prone and shaking form with clinical intensity.

\"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy --- it\'s all right, up you get.\" She turned to the rest of the class. \"None of you are to so much as move an inch while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you\'ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say Quidditch! Come on, dear.\"

A still quietly sobbing Neville Longbottom allowed himself to be led off by their instructor, who still shot suspicious glances over her shoulder every so often until she was no longer able to do so.

No sooner were they out of earshot than Draco burst into laughter. \"Did you see his face, the great lump!\"

Most of the gathered Slytherins joined in, but Harry was not among them. A deep frown marred his features, though he hid it from those present the best he could. He liked Draco and he didn\'t want to upset him, or any of his other friends, but he still found it very difficult to laugh at somebody like Neville. It was too reminiscent of what Dudley had done to him for much of his childhood and something about it seemed wrong.

Yet despite his inclinations against his friends\' actions, he held his tongue.

\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil.

\"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" jeered Pansy. \"Never thought you\'d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\"

That shut Patil up effectively. It was rather well done, though the exact subtleties went over Harry\'s head. He did notice how nobody seemed to openly rage at Pansy for her remarks though, and he had a strong suspicion that wouldn\'t have been the case had it been Draco who\'d interjected.

Speaking of Draco, he had darted forward and snatched something up from the ground. It took Harry a moment to identify exactly what it was he held, but the point was moot, for Draco announced it loud and clear not a second later.

\"Look! It\'s that stupid thing Longbottom\'s gran sent him.\"

The remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up, and Harry\'s gut tightened as conflicting emotions raged within him, just as they had hours earlier in the Great Hall.

***That morning...***

Draco had received another batch of sweets, as had Harry, courtesy of the same package. He was still trying to wrap his head around the Malfoys\' generosity and had not yet managed it, but he was profoundly grateful, nonetheless.

\"Care for a stroll?\" Draco asked Harry, Crabbe, and Goyle.

\"Where to?\" Harry asked as the two larger boys nodded in agreement with his question.

Draco smirked and tilted his head in the direction of the Gryffindor table. Longbottom of all people seemed to be temporarily holding court, showing something off to the small crowd of first years gathered around him.

Harry shrugged, not really caring one way or the other as he followed Draco to his feet and trailed him across the hall, coming to stop behind where Longbottom, Weasley and some of the others were sitting.

The round-faced boy seemed to be holding a small, glass, spherical something that Harry had never seen before. The small amounts of sunlight streaming down from the enchanted ceiling far above caught the glass at eye-catching angles, causing it to glitter in the light, giving off the impression that Longbottom was showcasing some sort of long-lost treasure.

A long-lost treasure that Draco snatched swiftly from the boy\'s grasp, drawing the attention of all gathered at the table as he examined the mysterious object with interest. The glass\... something seemed to be filled with vivid, reddish light, and Harry wondered exactly what it was.

His thoughts suddenly became much less important when Weasley and Finnigan sprang to their feet, going for their wands. Harry drew his own instinctively with lightning-like reflexes, hardly realizing he had drawn it at all. Crabbe and Goyle just cracked their knuckles imposingly, but only Weasley had actually managed to get to his wand before Harry had his own drawn, halting Finnigan from pulling his from its resting place.

The moment seemed to stretch on as Harry started questioning what exactly he had just done and whether or not it was the right thing to do.

Why exactly had Harry defended Draco? Judging by everything he knew, Draco was in the wrong. But he liked Draco, and he didn\'t want to see him cursed or hurt. It was an agonizing dilemma. What was more important --- friendship or morals? Harry had never known friendship before and he had never exactly been lectured on what was right and wrong. His ideas on morality were likely jaded. The only thing he really knew was that bullying was horrid, and this did sort of seem like bullying.

But he liked Draco.

Gah!

Merlin, this was complicated.

\"What\'s going on?\" said a sharp and familiar voice that snapped Harry from his deep, philosophical train of thought. Professor McGonagall now loomed over them, staring intently at both groups with narrowed eyes.

\"Malfoy\'s got my remembrall, Professor,\" Longbottom moaned.

Scowling, Draco quickly dropped the remembrall back on the table. \"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him. Harry shot a conflicted look towards the Gryffindors that might have been considered apologetic before trailing in the wake of his three friends.

\"Anything interesting?\" Theodore was asking when Harry retook his seat beside Draco.

\"Just a remembrall,\" the blond dismissed, returning easily to the plate of food in front of him.

Harry glanced furtively around, wanting to ask a question but not daring to actually do so. Having been conditioned against doing such things for most of his life, he found asking questions to be rather difficult.

\"Is something wrong, Harry?\"

Obviously, he hadn\'t been subtle in his contemplations, and Pansy caught him out almost at once, causing him to sigh deeply. \"What\'s a remembrall?\" he asked, hoping the question didn\'t come across as too ignorant or foolish.

\"Oh yeah,\" said Draco, sending a sympathetic look in Harry\'s direction. \"Sorry, I sometimes forget you don\'t know these things. A remembrall helps you remember things you\'ve forgotten. Longbottom\'s was glowing light red because he had forgotten something.\"

\"It has another purpose, too,\" said Theodore.

Draco rolled his eyes. \"I was getting to that, Nott.\" He turned back to Harry. \"If you\'ve had your memories blocked, or removed, or whatever, a remembrall will let you know. It can even sometimes bring them back, depending on how they were blocked. A lot of old, powerful families have them lying around just in case. They\'re not perfect, but they\'re dead useful a lot of the time.\"

That made a degree of sense, but Harry shuddered at the idea of having his memories taken from him. That did not sound at all pleasant, and the idea of anyone playing with his mind was one that greatly disturbed him.

***Back in the present...***

\"Give it here, Malfoy!\" shouted Ron Weasley, darting forward and brandishing a large fist menacingly at Draco. Crabbe and Goyle tensed, obviously ready to fight back if needed.

Draco\'s lips just curved upwards. \"No, I don\'t think I will. I think maybe I\'ll help Longbottom out. Maybe if I give him a good enough reason, the stupid oaf might even learn to fly.\" Crabbe and Goyle snickered as the frown Harry wore deepened. \"Hmm... where to put it? Maybe... up a tree?\"

\"Give it here!\" Weasley bellowed, marching towards Draco with stiffened shoulders and a resolute expression.

Draco lazily tossed the remembrall towards Harry, who almost missed it in his shock, horror, and conflicting tumult of emotions.

It was on instinct alone that he managed to deftly snatch it from the air, and he had never been so conflicted in his life as when Weasley had whirled, snarled, and charged towards him.

Given the opportunity to think rationally, Harry would never know what he would have done. Fear overrode his natural train of thought as Weasley bore down upon him, and he hastily threw the glass ball back to Draco, not wanting to get pummeled by the much taller red-head who looked as though he would punch a hole through Harry\'s face if he got within arm\'s reach.

The distraction was all Draco had needed.

He caught the ball easily just as he mounted one of the brooms and rose steadily into the air. It didn\'t seem as though he had been joking about his abilities now. His grip might have been wrong, but Draco looked very comfortable in the sky, and he leered down at Weasley with obvious arrogance and no small amount of smugness.

\"Come and get it, Weasley,\" he called down.

\"Don\'t!\" screeched Hermione Granger, wide-eyed. \"You\'ll get in terrible trouble---\"

But Weasley wasn\'t listening.

He had already mounted the broom and was now soaring skywards, shooting towards Draco like a vengeful meteorite. The blond barrel-rolled, causing Weasley to sail harmlessly through the space his head had occupied just a second earlier. As soon as he turned, Weasley rocketed at Draco again, but this time he was ready for an evasive maneuver. Draco tried to dodge to the side, but Weasley thrust out his elbow, which slammed painfully into the bridge of Draco\'s nose, causing him to elicit a loud yelp and for a thick, steady stream of blood to begin trickling from his nostrils like crimson droplets from a tap left on low.

He sneered in hatred, obviously livid as he glared back towards Weasley, hovering some ten feet in front of him. \"Fine!\" he spat. \"You want the stupid ball? Catch!\"

The next thing Harry knew, Draco had hurled the remembrall towards the ground, and he suddenly felt extremely guilty for what was about to happen.

Except it didn\'t.

Weasley dove like a madman, earning collective screams from those gathered far below\...

Screams that turned into exclamations of awe and wonderment as, right before it looked as though he would fatally headbutt the grass, Weasley\'s hand shot out and closed around the remembrall. He just barely managed to pull his broom out of the dive in time to avoid certain disaster. Though, his feet did clip the ground, sending him sprawling and rolling across the grass like a misshapen football.

Harry\'s guilt lessened as he noticed Weasley was largely unhurt.

\"RONALD WEASLEY!\"

And then suddenly returned when he saw Professor McGonagall striding towards them, shaking with what appeared to be rage as she glared towards her student with a gleam in her eyes Harry could only assume to be anger.

Draco looked extremely smug despite his crimson mask, but Harry couldn\'t help but think Weasley could have avoided whatever punishment was about to befall him had he just handed the remembrall over.

Those thoughts dominated his psyche even after the class was told to return to the castle. He was so lost in conflicting thoughts as they walked back up towards the oak front doors that he hardly noticed Pansy fawning over Draco or Theodore cursing Weasley\'s name.

He was too consumed by emotions that were as alien to him as the sweets Draco\'s family had been sending.

***That night, at dinner...***

Harry still hadn\'t gotten over his raging emotions by the time his contingent entered the Great Hall for dinner some hours later. To his dismay, Draco immediately made his way towards the Gryffindor table. Harry wanted to make off towards their own, but everyone was following Draco and he could do little more than accept whatever was about to happen.

\"Enjoying your last meal, Weasley?\" Draco asked when they came within range of the boy and his friends.

The blond\'s eyes looked like angry storm clouds in his current state of mind, but Weasley merely smirked back at him, something that made Draco look a lot less sure of himself.

\"You\'re a lot braver now that you have your friends to back you up,\" snarked Weasley, glaring at all of them in turn.

Harry saw Theodore\'s jaw tighten as the boy visibly twitched, obviously desiring nothing more than to draw his wand and curse Weasley into oblivion. Harry himself had a feeling the Gryffindor boy would have been much less confident had the staff table not been full. He knew they couldn\'t do anything to him without getting in immediate and serious trouble.

Draco clearly knew it too, for he sneered viciously. \"I\'ll take you on any day, Weasley,\" he said, actually sounding completely confident and deadly serious. \"How about tonight, in the trophy room?\"

\"Tonight?\"

\"Yes, Weasley, tonight. How about at midnight? There shouldn\'t be too many teachers around by then, and we should be able to duel and get out of there before any of them find out what we\'re doing.\"

Weasley\'s jaw set. \"Fine, you\'re on.\"

\"Who\'s your second?\" asked Theodore.

Ron hesitated. \"Seamus,\" he said after a moment of thought, \"what about yours?\"

\"Harry,\" Draco said immediately and without so much as a thought.

Harry had to fight the widening of his eyes very hard as not to reveal exactly what he was thinking.

Him?

He didn\'t know the first thing about duelling. Had it not been for random snippets of conversation over the past week and a half he had been privy to, he wouldn\'t have even known duelling was a thing that wizards did. He supposed that during their practice session last Friday night, he *had* been the most successful of their group in the practicing of spells, but still...

Even if he was the best candidate, he wasn\'t sure he wanted to. He still felt horrible about what could have happened to Neville\'s remembrall, and he had nothing against Ron Weasley. He didn\'t approve of how he had elbowed Draco in the nose twenty feet in the air. That could have ended in disaster, but Draco had technically started it.

Fortunately --- or unfortunately, depending on how one viewed the situation --- Harry never had the chance to accept or deny.

\"Fine,\" spat Weasley, now glaring at Harry as if he were Voldemort reincarnated.

Draco looked supremely smug as he led them back towards the Slytherin table.

\"What did you do?\" asked Harry in a low hiss of a whisper. \"I don\'t know anything about duelling! I know some spells, but---\"

\"Calm down, Harry,\" Draco dismissed with a wave of his hand and a roll of his eyes, grinning as the group took their seats at the Slytherin table. \"We\'re not *actually* going to that duel.\"

\"We-we\'re not?\"

\"Of course not.\" Draco sounded as though the fact was the single most obvious thing in the world. \"We would *definitely* get caught. The racket a duel would cause in the trophy room would be awful.\"

\"You\'re going to go to one of the professors?\" asked Pansy, nodding along as she suddenly worked out exactly what Draco was planning.

The boy smirked and nodded. \"Exactly.\"

Harry still felt conflicted. For a split second, he debated warning Weasley about what was to come.

He dismissed the idea almost at once.

It would be foolish to do so and his friends would be upset with him, which was the last thing he wanted. Moreover, Weasley had accepted the duel. He wasn\'t being forced into anything and it was his fault if he decided to break curfew by several hours.

He wasn\'t sure that it was the right thing, but Harry nodded along, deciding at that moment he would do nothing to prevent the events from transpiring.

***Late that night, in Gryffindor Tower...***

Ron Weasley shook with both terror and fury as he unsteadily settled into his four-poster bed, regretfully listening to the sobs of Neville Longbottom in the background.

Everything had gone to hell as soon as he and Seamus had left for the duel with Malfoy and Potter.

They had found Neville locked out of the tower as soon as they had stepped outside, and had then been accosted by the walking tornado that was Hermione Granger. Honestly, that girl threw so much at him sometimes that Ron felt like his brain would short-circuit. Worse still, the Fat Lady had been gone, locking them all outside and leading to Neville and Hermione following them to the trophy room.

When they entered, no Slytherins had been waiting for them, and no Slytherins showed up.

They were instead almost caught by Filch, who had obviously been tipped off by Potter and Malfoy, and was on the hunt for any bold enough to break curfew. They fled at once, running blindly through the halls at speeds that Ron was sure he could never have achieved under normal circumstances until, finally, they came to stand outside a locked door, suddenly cornered and desperate for an escape.

Until Hermione had unlocked the door and revealed the terrifying monster within.

Ron had thought being made the new Gryffindor seeker would have been the craziest thing that happened that day, but that baffling bit of reality didn\'t hold a candle to the three-headed monster that loomed behind the locked door leading to the out-of-bounds, third-floor corridor.

He had wondered, for a brief bit of time, exactly what Dumbledore had been thinking by allowing that thing into the school. He still wasn\'t sure it was a good idea, but after Hermione had pointed out the trapdoor under the monster\'s massive paws, he had a new question in mind.

What the hell was Dumbledore hiding?

**Author\'s Endnote:**

**I know this chapter may have seemed like a canon rehash, but the events did lead to some rather different results. Namely, Ron replacing Harry as the youngest seeker in a century. Primarily though, this chapter was used to show exactly where Harry\'s character is at in this story, as well as to not-so-subtly show that I will not be incessantly bashing Ron as most Slytherin Harry stories do. He will actually be getting a lot of limelight in this fic, so I hope you all enjoy me doing pretty much the opposite of 90% of Slytherin Harry stories.**

**Chapter 6: Differing Dilemmas**

***September 13, 1991***

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***2:13 PM***

The first-year Slytherins only had classes in the morning on Fridays, with the not-so-notable exception that was History of Magic. From what Harry could tell, many of the upper-year Slytherins skipped the class altogether. He couldn\'t blame them; it wasn\'t as though Binns would ever notice. He started every class the same way: by floating straight through the wall, unrolling his comically long parchment of notes, and beginning to read. He had never once taken the roll call; not even on the first day of class.

Harry enjoyed the subject, but its corresponding class was wholly and completely disappointing. Binns was an embarrassment of a professor and it took only a surprisingly light amount of pestering from Draco to convince Harry to skip the class that afternoon.

Harry was presently trying to bluff his way through a game of poker and struggling mightily. Pansy wasn\'t helping him nearly as much as she had been on the train, for she was buried nose-deep in a Charms essay Harry and Theodore had completed in the library the night before. Theodore was probably the most academic person in their group. Harry was, to an extent, an academic, but not to quite the same level. He was more curious about magic than anything else, whereas Theodore was already well-informed and hungry for more. The two of them had vacated the common room together on more than one occasion to seek refuge in the library while the others did whatever struck up their fancy at that particular moment in time.

Harry was very close to defeat in their game, and the issue was only exacerbated by the fact his mind really wasn\'t in it.

Ever since the dramatic flying lesson the day before, his mind had been wrought with the conflict between his morals and his friends. Weasley somehow hadn\'t been caught out the night prior, which either meant he hadn\'t fallen for it, or he had just gotten away. Harry wasn\'t sure which, but it had greatly irritated Draco.

He had been in a less than pleasant mood all day, partially as a result of that fact. Harry was far more conflicted. He felt as though he should be upset, just like Draco, as he was the closest friend he had. But he couldn\'t quite will himself to feel that way, since a not-so-small part of him had also spent most of the past twenty-four hours questioning whether or not what they had done was wrong, even if nothing truly awful had come of it.

This distraction was costing him dearly and before long, the game had ended. Harry needed to think. If he didn\'t, the tumultuous conflict would only continue, distracting him from any pursuit he may wish to dedicate himself to. He did have to get a Potions essay done, or at least started tonight, among other things. Theodore also wanted to practice spells again that evening, which meant Harry\'s mind was going to need to be as clear as possible.

He wasn\'t exactly sure what would happen if it wasn\'t, but their first lesson in Transfiguration had taught him that being in the right state of mind and visualizing things in the correct way for you was essential when casting magic. Harry really didn\'t want to find out what would happen if he cast curses while not being in the proper state of mind. Especially if Crabbe and Goyle were serving as test dummies again --- yet another thing that made him cringe and wonder exactly what he had stumbled his way into.

With a quick apology and a muttered excuse about needing some air, Harry scampered from the common room. The excuse about needing some air actually wasn\'t all that out of the ordinary. A fair few Slytherins did need to retreat to the grounds at least once or twice a day to see some light. According to Theodore, being in constant darkness wasn\'t good for most people\'s mental state. The common room had no true windows, since it was underground. The closest thing it had was the portholes, providing a view of the vast lake beyond.

It didn\'t bother Harry. After spending much of a decade locked in a dank, dark cupboard and left to stare dully up at the underside of a singular set of stairs every passing night, the dungeons felt like a vibrant utopia with blindingly bright sunlight and sparklingly perfect seas stretching far and wide.

He got about halfway down the corridor just outside the common room when he heard swift footsteps echoing behind him, very obviously following in his wake. His hand twitched instinctively towards his wand as he glanced over his shoulder, but he quickly became more confused than worried.

\"Diana?\"

\"Good afternoon, Harry. Mind if I walk with you?\" He shook his head in the affirmative, not entirely sure of why she would want to, but not entirely averse to the idea, either.

They walked in silence until they neared the top of the steps leading them up to the castle\'s ground floor, at which point Harry quickly realized he wasn\'t entirely sure where he wanted to go.

\"I know a nice place if you just need a breather,\" said Diana, wearing a knowing expression as she spoke. \"It\'s a few floors above us, but the walk isn\'t terribly long. There\'s a shortcut that will speed things up.\"

Harry nodded numbly, allowing himself to be led up the marble staircase.

They walked for some time before Diana led him through a tapestry and onto a stunning balcony. The weathered cobblestone landing had iron railings that overlooked the grounds that were far below. From this height, Harry could see everything. From the expansive green lawns, to the lake shimmering and sparkling in the afternoon sunlight, to the seemingly endless forest on the edge of the grounds, stretching further than the eye could see.

It was probably the single most beautiful sight Harry had ever seen. The only other that even compared had been his first sight of Hogwarts while riding across the black lake almost two weeks ago, and wasn\'t that just mind-boggling? It had easily been the fastest two weeks of Harry\'s young life, even if they had also been without a doubt the most complicated.

\"It\'s beautiful, isn\'t it?\" asked Diana, smiling fondly out over the grounds, looking more relaxed than Harry had ever seen her younger brother. Here, atop the tower, she could have been a royal surveying her land with pride and admiration. She certainly resembled that image far more than that of a thirteen-year-old girl having a casual conversation with her younger acquaintance.

\"It is,\" Harry agreed, turning his gaze back to the sight in question.

\"I come here sometimes,\" said Diana, \"usually when I need a breather or something becomes too much.\" Harry still wasn\'t looking at her, but he could practically feel her stare burning into his side. \"It\'s a nice spot to just gather your thoughts and calm your mind.\" He nodded slowly. \"Can you tell me what it is that\'s bothering you?\"

Harry wasn\'t sure how to answer that. It was so foreign. He had never been asked such a question in his life and he found it oddly jarring. For his entire life, he had only ever had himself to rely on. It had always been up to him to work out his own problems and sort out any jumbled emotions he had.

He had seen Dudley venting to Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon before, but he had never done so himself. Not that they would have listened to him even if he had --- he actually had a strong suspicion Aunt Petunia would have hit him over the head with a frying pan --- but he could honestly say the impulse had never once arisen.

He wasn\'t sure how he felt about Diana asking him this question and the confusion on his face obviously showed. His eyes snapped back to her briefly, he could see the look of obvious concern that marred her otherwise picturesque face.

\"The muggles you lived with didn\'t treat you very well, did they?\" Harry tensed at the question, but he could tell at once that exact reaction had given him away. \"I\'m guessing you were never asked these kinds of questions before, were you?\" Numbly, Harry shook his head. \"It can be helpful to talk about it, sometimes. A lot of the time, other people have been through things you haven\'t. They might be able to look at a situation that you can\'t look at in the same way.\"

Harry bit his lip. \"It\'s... not easy to explain and... a bit embarrassing.\"

\"I won\'t go around telling everyone about it. You don\'t have to tell me, but if you think it might be helpful, I\'ll do my best to give advice or help you any way I can.\"

Harry couldn\'t help but appreciate the way the question was asked. Diana was not attempting to force his hand; instead, she was simply offering.

Harry\'s instincts all screamed to decline the offer, but he paused, deciding to actually give it some thought before reacting on gut instinct alone.

She definitely had much more experience in these sorts of things than he did. Part of his issue when deciphering the dilemma was the fact he had never had friends before. Diana always seemed to be surrounded by a clique of students around her own age, so Harry assumed she was fairly popular. Even if he was overestimating her popularity, she certainly had far more friends than he had ever had.

He looked back out over the grounds as he took a deep breath, trying to focus on anything but the girl stood next to him as he finally admitted what had been plaguing his thoughts for the better part of twenty-four hours.

\"I don\'t know what I\'m doing when it comes to friends.\"

Diana\'s expression suddenly shifted to the perfect image of sadness, though Harry, still surveying the grounds and looking anywhere but at the Malfoy Heiress, didn\'t see it.

\"You might have to be more specific,\" she said in a soft, quiet voice.

\"Your brother does things I don\'t understand. Yesterday, he took Longbottom\'s remembrall for no reason. He took it at the table during breakfast, then again when Longbottom broke his wrist during our first flying lesson. He started this huge fight with Weasley and then tried to get him in trouble, even though Weasley didn\'t do anything.\"

Harry was wringing his hands and Diana could distinctly see that he was having trouble articulating exactly what was on his mind.

\"I don\'t know why he did it; it seemed pointless. There wasn\'t any reason for it and it just seemed like bullying. But I like Draco. He\'s treated me really well, just like you and your parents have. Same goes for Pansy, Theodore, Crabbe, and Goyle. They all just let it happen, so I\'m confused. Am I supposed to stop him because I think he\'s doing something wrong, or am I supposed to laugh like all the others? It seemed wrong, but he\'s my friend, so I\'m supposed to support him, right? I don\'t want him to not be friends with me because I stopped him from doing something like that, but I also felt bad for Weasley and Longbottom yesterday.\"

Diana didn\'t answer at once. \"That\'s... a complicated question. The first thing you have to understand is that my family and the Weasleys don\'t get along. We have never gotten along, but especially not in this generation.\"

She paused again, fidgeting uncomfortably. \"My brother... he also isn\'t the most mature person you will ever meet. He\'s well-spoken and has been raised to act the part, but he is eleven and very much acts his age. You\'re a bit different. You don\'t know as much as Draco about a lot of things and your views are different. You see the world differently, but knowing less about some things also means you think more. You think before you do things; Draco doesn\'t always do that. He probably just saw a chance to go after Weasley and decided to take it. Longbottom, too. Our families were never directly rivals until lately, but... well, that\'s even more complicated.\"

\"What do you mean?\"

Diana looked much older than she actually was when she next answered. \"Years ago, my father was accused of something horrible. Something he never actually did. He was proven innocent by the Wizengamot and everything. Longbottom\'s parents... they\'re not dead, but they\'re in no state to be his parents. They were attacked at the end of the last war, and they\'ve been locked up in St. Mungo\'s --- the major wizarding hospital --- ever since. They\'re as good as comatose, so Longbottom has been raised by his grandmother and she\'s basically run their family ever since.

\"Well, the thing is, she\'s never let my father live it down. She\'s also accused him of somehow fooling the courts. She\'s made him out to be this horrible person and tried to slander him at every turn. Draco probably lashed out at her grandson because of that.\"

\"That sounds awful,\" said Harry, finally looking back at Diana, who shrugged.

\"I wish she wouldn\'t do it. The Longbottoms are an old and important family, so some people even believe the rubbish she says about Father. It\'s unfortunate, but it\'s part of politics. Our families have different political views, so it\'s something she does to try and take away from the points Father makes.\"

\"That sounds awful, though.\"

\"It\'s part of politics. It\'s not pleasant, but it\'s not unexpected, either.\"

\"So... I should let Draco do these things?\"

Diana tapped her fingers on the rail. \"You shouldn\'t be too upset with him for it,\" she said. \"He\'s been raised knowing these people\'s families attack Father every chance they get. He\'s well within his rights to be upset, I think.\"

Harry nodded; that was fair. He could hardly blame Draco for being angry about such things and his actions suddenly made a lot more sense.

\"But like I said,\" Diana continued, \"you think things through more than he does, sometimes. If you think he\'s gone too far, you can say something after it happens, at least.\" She hesitated. \"There\'s a... sort of unwritten rule in Slytherin that makes this even more complicated.\"

\"Unwritten rule?\" asked Harry, frowning as he tried to figure out exactly what kind of rule the older girl could be talking about.

\"An unwritten rule, yes.\" She sighed. \"If you haven\'t noticed yet, the rest of the school doesn\'t exactly love Slytherin.\"

He nodded; he had noticed. If he hadn\'t initially, the dirty looks he had been getting from many in the hallways and the occasional Tripping Jinx fired from behind had most certainly alerted him.

\"Well, with Gryffindor and Hufflepuff always set against us --- and Ravenclaw not usually wanting to help --- it would be a bad idea for Slytherins to be arguing all the time. If we gave the other houses ammunition or showed them weakness, things would only get worse.\"

Harry could easily understand that. He knew better than most what happened when you showed weakness around people who despised you. Ten years with the Dursleys had practically earned him a Ph.D. in the subject.

\"Well, we don\'t want that to happen, so the rule is sort of not to argue amongst ourselves in public. When we\'re around the other houses, it\'s best to look like all is well and good, that way they don\'t take advantage of the weakness. So if Draco does something in front of the whole of Gryffindor, calling him out on it right then and there might be a bad idea.\"

Harry practically shuddered at the thought. The Gryffindors already hadn\'t been the kindest bunch to him. He could only imagine what would happen if he gave them any sort of advantage.

\"So if I think Draco\'s gone too far or is just being a bully without need,\" Harry said slowly, \"I should talk to him about it later?\"

Diana nodded with a smile. \"Exactly. He\'s far from perfect. Draco is a lot of things and he\'s not the most subtle boy in the world. He also doesn\'t think sometimes, as I said, and he looks up to Father a lot. Father rants about the Weasleys and Longbottoms all the time, so it\'s rubbed off on Draco. I\'m sure he\'s going to lash out at the other children without thinking. If it\'s just banter, it\'s fine. When he starts stealing family artifacts like remembralls...\"

\"It\'s a bit too far,\" Harry finished.

\"A bit too far,\" Diana agreed.

Harry smiled at her. He felt as though a great weight had been lifted off his shoulders. \"Thanks, Diana. I\'m... not very good with feelings and stuff.\"

Her expression turned sad. \"That\'s not your fault, Harry. Don\'t blame yourself for what happened with the muggles. It\'s them who should be sorry. If you ever need help, I\'m always here. I know you might not like asking for it, but it really isn\'t any bother.\" She smiled. \"Maybe having you be a bit more mature might even whip Draco into shape. Merlin knows he could use it.\"

Harry laughed, and the air around them lightened all at once.

***October 7, 1991***

***The Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom***

***1:10 PM***

Harry could happily say the weeks following his conversation with Diana had passed without incident. There had been an odd period of about a week and a half during which Draco had been surprisingly quiet. He had scarcely looked at the Gryffindors during that time, something Harry had noticed when he actually hadn\'t risen to their challenges. The novelty had worn off in time, but he still hadn\'t instigated any new conflicts with the house of the brave. It was an odd and sudden shift, though one Harry was definitely in favour of.

Time away from complex drama had allowed him and the others to settle into their schedule and Harry could easily say he was enjoying Hogwarts more than he had ever dared hope for.

He enjoyed Transfiguration greatly, and he really liked Charms. History was also intensely interesting --- so long as he wasn\'t sitting in Binns\'s classroom.

Despite his enjoyment for several different classes, his favourite of the lot was quite easily Defence Against the Dark Arts. Partly because the content was interesting, and partly because he, Theodore, and Draco had been practicing jinxes, hexes, and curses for the past number of weeks. It had become a sort of ritual every Friday night. They sometimes did practice on other nights as well, but Friday night practices had become a surety.

Part of it, though, was undoubtedly due to Professor Quirrell.

Quirrell was easily Harry\'s favourite professor, even though he did like most of them. Or at the very least, he admired them for their talents.

Quirrell was different, though.

For one thing, he had let them perform practical magic from right out of the gate, which had earned him major brownie points with Harry, as well as much of the Slytherin population. For another... it was hard to explain. He was just... interesting? The way he spoke about his subject was entrancing. He spoke with such knowledge and passion that one could not help but listen, and he had always been more than capable of answering Harry\'s, or anyone else\'s, questions.

That was another thing. Harry couldn\'t ever remember a time Quirrell had refused to answer a question. The other teachers had all said, at least once, that the content brought up by a question would be covered more in later years, but Quirrell had never denied them information.

Not even the odd headaches Harry felt while in his classroom had dissuaded his liking of the man. At first, he had thought the pains had been emanating from his scar, but he quickly realized that was ridiculous and supposed it must have just been the burning incense and strong stench of garlic.

Quirrell also just so happened to teach them really cool magic.

Like that day, for instance, when he decided it was finally time to learn to properly defend themselves.

\"There are two sides to a fight,\" Quirrell was saying. \"Or an attack, or a duel, or any such conflict. There is the instigator, and there is the defender. It\'s not so black and white as that, of course. The instigator can shield, and the defender can attack. That is what makes conflicts conflicts. They\'re rarely straightforward and rarely over quickly. That\'s why it\'s important that no matter what side you\'re on, you know how to do both.

\"So far, I\'ve done my best to help build up your foundations, but if I started flinging spells at you all right now, you would be helpless --- unless you could somehow dodge every spell I threw at you.\" The skeptical tone of his voice did an excellent job of getting across exactly how unlikely that was. \"Dodging is always the best option,\" Quirrell reminded them. \"It takes less time, doesn\'t occupy your wand, and you don\'t have to draw on any energy from around you. The problem is that it won\'t always be an option. Sometimes, you are stuck between a rock and a hard place and your only option is to defend.

\"The most basic form of defence is a shield. Now, there are *many* different shields out there that you can summon with magic. Today, we\'ll start from the beginning. I\'m going to teach you the most basic of shield charms. It wouldn\'t be of much use in a fight or an upper-level duel, but it will serve you all well at your age and it will be an apt introduction to the subject of defensive magic.\" He paused, surveying them all with those dark eyes of his. \"Can anyone tell me what this charm is?\"

Harry had read his entire Defence Against the Dark Arts book through almost two times now --- as it was his favourite subject --- so he actually did know this one. So, apparently, did Theodore and Daphne Greengrass, as both of their hands rose.

Quirrell pointed to Harry. \"Potter?\"

\"The Aegis Vocar shield, sir.\"

\"Good; five points to Slytherin. Yes, Aegis Vocar is the most basic magical shield. It\'s only meant to hold against jinxes and some very basic hexes, but it does have the unique ability to move with the caster. Some more powerful shields can do that as well, but they are much more advanced and they\'re more difficult to maintain.

\"Your task today,\" he continued, \"is to master the Aegis Vocar shield. I don\'t expect many of you to be capable of casting this spell by the end of class, but I am hopeful. If two of you achieve it, you will group up and practice against harmless jinxes from the other. Now, I will demonstrate the wand movement and we shall get underway.\"

Five or so minutes later, Harry found himself standing in a corner of the room, with Draco, Theodore, Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle not far away. He was slowly drawing the wand movement out in the air while the others tried in vain to get the shield to work. Harry\'s eyes were closed and he was envisioning the perfect shield springing into being in front of him.

\"Are you having troubles, Master Potter?\" Harry nearly jumped out of his skin at the sound of Quirrell\'s voice. \"My apologies,\" he said, \"I didn\'t mean to startle you. I was only wondering if you were having any difficulty with the spell?\"

Harry hastily shook his head. \"No, sir. I haven\'t tried yet. I\'ve just been making sure I\'ve got everything right.\"

Quirrell raised his eyebrows. \"And do you think you\'re ready to attempt the spell?\"

\"I think so, sir.\"

\"Let\'s see it then.\"

Harry whipped his wand in a quick, tight circle in front of his chest. \"Aegis Vocar!\"

The shield was not visible, even when cast at its best, but Harry could feel the magic drawn towards him, feel it rush through his wand, and feel the air ripple in front of him. He beamed and Quirrell\'s brows rose still further.

\"May I?\" he asked, gesturing towards where Harry\'s shield must have been. When Harry gave permission, the professor withdrew his wand and prodded Harry\'s shield five or so times. \"It isn\'t as solid as it could be,\" he said, \"but it is an excellent attempt for one with your level of experience.\" He eyed Harry critically. \"This is your first attempt, Master Potter?\"

\"Yes, sir.\"

The man nodded, eyeing him with an intent stare. \"Continue at this level, Potter, and I think I will have to come up with some new challenges for you. You have exceptional potential within this branch of magic. See that it does not go to waste.\"

The professor stalked off to check on the others and Harry pondered the words deeply.

It was one of the first genuine compliments from an adult he had ever received and he had to admit, it was quite a nice feeling.

***October 19, 1991***

***The Grounds of Hogwarts***

***9:24 AM***

The sound of two children laughing might have been heard early one Saturday morning on the Hogwarts grounds had the wind not ruthlessly taken the noise and ripped it away, carrying it adrift almost as rapidly as the source of the sound was flying.

Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy soared above the grounds, laughing exuberantly as they flew a fast lap around the black lake, the wind sweeping through their hair and the cool, crisp fall air caressing their skin.

It was what would likely be one of the last decent fall mornings. Halloween was fast-approaching --- or, as Harry\'s new group of friends called it --- Samhain. Many of the upper-year students had warned their younger counterparts that in the Scottish Highlands, the death of October often meant the end of any chance at decent weather.

Draco had been insistent they take advantage of the morning, and Harry hadn\'t exactly been hard to convince.

Since their first fiasco of a flying lesson, several more had gone off without a hitch. During each of them, Harry had often come to the same two realizations; he really enjoyed flying, and he was startlingly good at it. Draco had most definitely been right in assuming Harry wouldn\'t have any troubles on a broom. It had come more naturally to him than almost anything else he had ever done, and as soon as Draco had seen this, he had practically dragged Harry out on the grounds to fly.

First years weren\'t allowed to own brooms, but they were, with the permission of Madam Hooch, allowed to borrow some of the school ones. Her permission usually hinged on how much aptitude she saw during their lessons and how comfortable she was in allowing them to fly freely. She had no worries about Harry or Draco, so she had acquiesced without drama and they had made a sort of habit of it. Harry would very much miss the early morning flights once the air around the castle was too frigid to comfortably zip through on a broomstick. It was one of his favourite things in the magical world so far. He loved it more than anything he had ever seen or experienced in the muggle one.

The boys\' laughter only became even more joyful when they swooped around the lake once more, this time to notice their friends gathered under one of the trees, the vibrant, fall-coloured leaves dotted out all around them like a haphazardly discarded blanket.

With a glance at each other, the both of them came in for the landing, touching down smoothly in front of Pansy, Theodore, Crabbe, Goyle, Diana, and a few older students Harry didn\'t recognize.

A girl a couple of inches taller than Diana with golden blonde hair was nearest to her. She had deep blue eyes and angelic features, and Harry didn\'t know her by name, though he had seen her around Draco\'s sister more often than not. With them as well were two boys. They were both large, each with short hair. One of them had rather chiselled features where the other\'s were bulkier and his brown hair was slicked back.

\"I don\'t suppose you\'ve met my friends?\" Diana asked Harry once the two first-year boys had taken seats. Harry shook his head a bit nervously --- meeting new people always gave him a certain amount of anxiety.

Diana seemed to notice, as the small, brief smile she shot his way was as reassuring as one could be. \"Right then. Harry, meet Cassandra Yaxley, Graham Montague, and Cassius Warrington. All heirs or heiresses to their respective families.\"

Cassandra was the first to offer her hand, though she studied him with a rather piercing gaze.

Warrington was next, and his own stare was interesting in a different sort of way. \"How long have you been flying, Potter?\"

Harry rolled his shoulders a bit awkwardly. \"I\'ve only just started.\"

Warrington\'s brows rose. \"Really?\" Harry nodded. \"Keep practicing,\" he told him, \"you have the build for a seeker and could probably end up on the Slytherin team in the next few years.\"

\"Could be next year,\" said Montague. \"Higgs graduates in June.\"

Warrington nodded. \"True.\"

A part of Harry wanted to deny it, but a larger part of him was dominated by an eleven-year-old\'s imagination. He couldn\'t help but envision himself raising the Quidditch Cup high above his head, resplendent in Slytherin team robes and with the silver captain\'s badge proudly gleaming on his chest.

It was a beguiling image.

Beguiling enough that he didn\'t even notice the way Draco frowned very deeply at the words, nor his older sister shooting him a warning glance over Harry\'s shoulder.

***October 30, 1991***

***The Charms Classroom***

***2:56 PM***

At long last, the Slytherins were finally set to perform genuinely interesting practical magic in Charms.

Thus far, they had done little more than read an obscene amount of theory, write an obscene amount about theory, and learned mundane spells that took absolutely no effort to master. For the better part of a week, Flitwick had been promising that they would finally be learning something interesting --- the Levitation Charm. Harry was certain, judging by the levels of excitement exuding from each and every single one of them, that the whole class would have walked out had the diminutive professor changed his mind; but mercifully, the man had kept his word

After an absurd tale about a buffalo ending up on some poor man\'s chest due to a botched incantation, they were all told to come to the front of the class, grab a feather, and begin.

\"Weasley\'s so thick; I bet he\'ll buy the rubbish about the buffalo,\" Draco was saying as they neared the front of the class.

\"All of the Gryffindorks will probably buy it,\" Theodore said with a roll of his eyes.

\"Longbottom might actually wet himself,\" said Pansy with a smirk. \"I hope Professor Flitwick knows more than Charms, because he might have to transfigure his knickers into a nappy.\"

\"Can we not talk about Longbottom\'s underwear?\" moaned Harry, causing his friends all around him to laugh. The conversation switched tones after that, which relieved him, though not for the reasons he\'d led his friends to believe.

Diana\'s point about subtlety had stuck. It was something Harry was slowly working on.

Harry and Draco were at a table together and they were both terribly excited.

Harry didn\'t think he was quite as adept at the theoretical side of their classes as somebody like Hermione Granger, but he was thrilled at the natural talent he seemed to have. Professor McGonagall had described it as an intuitive sense for magic. While Draco didn\'t have that, Charms was one of his best subjects and it was one he enjoyed quite a bit.

\"Wingardium Leviosa,\" he said, swishing and flicking his wand.

Draco\'s feather twitched.

Harry cracked up and Draco scowled at him. \"What\'s so funny?\"

Harry threw up his hands. \"Nothing, nothing. You just sounded so confident.\"

Draco rolled his eyes. \"Let\'s see you go then, Merlin,\" he challenged.

A swish, a flick, and a carefully enunciated incantation later, Harry\'s feather was floating casually above the desk, and Draco was rolling his eyes so hard --- as Professor Flitwick bore down on Harry with a gleeful expression --- that the raven-haired youth was afraid they might fall out.

\"Prat,\" muttered Draco as Flitwick walked away, but the youngest Malfoy was grinning.

Harry smirked too and both boys turned their wands back towards the feathers.

***October 31, 1991***

***The Great Hall***

***6:00 PM***

The Great Hall was more elaborately decorated than Harry had ever seen. There was so much orange present that the entirety of the hall seemed to be bathed in its vibrant, fluorescent light.

The walls were draped in orange and where torches had hung before, there were now pumpkins; their eyes and mouths exuding bright, magical light. Even the usual golden plates and goblets had been replaced by orange. Dumbledore\'s holiday-themed robes were of the same colour and Harry thought they shone just as brightly as the walls, pumpkins, and lights. It was actually rather impressive.

His friends were not at all happy.

\"It\'s an embarrassment,\" hissed Theodore, glaring daggers at Dumbledore from his seat at the Slytherin table. \"The old fool is trying to ruin every tradition we\'ve ever had. He doesn\'t care about any of them. The only thing that matters to him is making the scum feel welcome.\"

\"It\'s disgusting,\" agreed Draco. \"Father goes on and on about Dumbledore and his stance on muggleborns. He says Dumbledore is going to be single-handedly responsible for destroying the old ways if he isn\'t stopped soon.\"

Harry listened to their banter silently, though he found himself very confused for most of the conversation.

The extent of his knowledge about the situation was that pureblood wizards didn\'t celebrate Halloween. Apparently, Halloween was a purely muggle holiday. The purebloods and more traditional halfbloods celebrated something called Samhain. Harry had been reluctant to ask about it. He found asking questions difficult and he didn\'t want to be viewed as foolish. He had considered asking Diana, since she had been so welcoming with questions earlier in the year, but a proper situation really hadn\'t presented itself. Perhaps now would be the appropriate time to ask. It might even stop his friends\' vicious tirade against the Hogwarts Headmaster.

Before he could, the doors to the Great Hall slammed open with a resounding crash that rang through the room like the clattering of many bolts of thunder.

Argus Filch staggered into the room, wide-eyed and clearly terrified. He could barely walk in a straight line, though Harry noticed his typical habit of shuffling was gone. He had never seen the cantankerous man move so fast. In what seemed no more than an instant, he was on his knees in front of Dumbledore, wheezing and gasping as he managed three feeble sentences that were somehow caught by every single student gathered in the luridly decorated hall.

\"Troll... in the dungeons. Did what any sensible man would do and got the hell out of there. Thought you ought to know.\"

Then, he fainted, and pandemonium broke loose.

Several booming fireworks were shot from Dumbledore\'s wand, and the collective mass fell silent.

\"Prefects,\" Dumbledore said in a surprisingly strong and clear voice for one his age. \"If you are members of Gryffindor or Ravenclaw, you will carefully escort your students back to their common rooms. Hufflepuffs and Slytherins, you will all remain here, as I view it unwise to allow you to draw so close to the troll\'s alleged location. I and the other professors will leave after the prefects and their houses, at which point I will be locking you all in the hall. Nobody is to make any attempt at leaving until one of us returns and instructs you all to do so.\" Nobody made a sound. \"Well, prefects --- chop chop!\"

The sound of the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw benches scraping backwards screeched through the hall and the prefects led their charges out the massive doors faster than Harry might have expected. The staff were on their heels, with Dumbledore in the lead, lurid orange robes billowing like autumn leaves in a strong, crisp wind.

Once all of them had left, the doors to the Great Hall closed with a loud, clattering thud.

***Minutes later, on the second floor...***

\"What do you think happened?\" Neville asked Ron in a panic as they slowly followed Percy and the other prefects up towards Gryffindor Tower.

\"No idea,\" said Ron. \"Mum and Dad have always said Hogwarts is the safest place in Britain. They wouldn\'t believe it if I said somebody could have ever gotten hurt at Hogwarts.\" Neville froze in mid-stride, and he suddenly went as white as a ghost. Ron frowned. \"You alright, Neville?\"

\"Hermione\...\"

Ron went ashen.

During that day\'s Charms lesson, Ron had sat at a table with Hermione as they were tasked with mastering the Levitation Charm. She had annoyingly gotten the charm on her first try, but she had also been an arrogant prat about it, in Ron\'s opinion.

Still, he was all of a sudden wishing he had possessed a little bit more tact while they had left the class.

According to Parvati Patil, Hermione was locked up in a bathroom on the second floor, so she would have no idea about the troll running loose in the castle.

\"Oh, bollocks!\"

***Back in the Great Hall...***

\"How could a troll have gotten in?\" Pansy was asking in a hurried whisper.

\"It couldn\'t have,\" said Theodore. \"Father\'s told me about the Hogwarts wards. He says there are none like them in the world. There\'s only one way a troll could have gotten into Hogwarts.\"

\"Are you saying one of the teachers let it in?\" Harry asked with wide eyes.

Theodore\'s eyes gleamed. \"Don\'t be so naive, Harry. Not all teachers are angels.\"

The thought that one of the professors would ever do such a thing made Harry shudder.

All of the conversation dominating the half-full hall seemed to be of a similar nature. The one surety was that everyone had become so preoccupied with their own conversations that nobody had noticed that Filch\'s once prone body had vanished from the hall.

***Meanwhile...***

Ron was well aware that the two of them --- he and Neville --- were likely making the single most foolish decision of their lives as they neared the corridor housing the bathroom Hermione was supposedly locked up in.

Then, the stench hit them. Ron would have cried out in protest had Neville not clamped a hand firmly over his mouth.

Both of them leant slowly and carefully around the corner and what they saw was beyond anything they had ever spotted before.

The grotesque being lumbering through the halls had to be nearly ten feet tall, and it was absolutely massive. Its grey skin gave it a dullishly sinister look, as did its dumb, beady eyes.

Ron and Neville watched in transfixed horror as the thing stupidly walked headlong into a door before growling at it and forcing entry by slamming its fist into the impediment. Seeing a golden opportunity and taking a moment of inspiration, Ron sprinted forward, lunged for the door, slammed it shut, and turned the lock.

\"Ha!\" he exclaimed, and he and Neville beamed openly at each other, taking pride in a job well done.

Until a high-pitched scream ripped through the corridor, and their breath was snatched from them as suddenly as it might have been had they leapt naked into ice-cold water in late January.

\"HERMIONE!\" both boys screamed as they both reached for the handle at the same time.

Ron got there first and forced the door open, then he and Neville charged in, freezing at the sight before them.

Hermione was sitting against the far wall, cowering as the troll loomed above her, towering tall and scowling down at her with obviously murderous intent.

Ron then did the single stupidest thing he had ever done in all his life.

\"Oi, dragon dung!\"

The troll whirled to face him, looking very confused, and then growled and began advancing.

\"Wingardium Leviosa!\" called out Ron, swishing his wand at the row of sinks on the wall to his right.

All but one of them wrenched themselves from the wall with horrible shattering noises, and Neville darted out of the way as Ron thrust his wand towards the troll. One after another, all of the sinks slammed hard against the thing\'s head and shattered.

The troll faltered but didn\'t stop.

Neville was trying to get Hermione on her feet and out of the bathroom, but her legs seemed too shaky to support her weight and Neville was having a hard time hauling her into an upright position. Worse still, the troll was bearing down on Ron, beady eyes narrowed and club raised.

Desperately, he repeated the same spell, ready to die at any moment.

Miraculously, he didn\'t.

The club rose out of the troll\'s grasp and it reached for the weapon confusedly, snorting and grunting as the club flew higher and higher and was soon out of its grasp. It then looked up at the implement now hovering above its head with a dumbstruck expression.

Ron released the spell, and the club fell, smacking into the troll\'s head with a resounding *CRACK!*

The impact drove the troll to its knees and caused the creature to let out an agonized moan as the club split in two as soon as it made contact with the troll\'s head. Ron was so stunned the thing wasn\'t dead or at least unconscious that he hadn\'t noticed its massive, grubby hands reaching for him until it was already too late.

He was pulled forward by the collar of his robes and he was suddenly certain once more he would die.

Until Neville, the meek, outcast of Gryffindor rushed forward with an animalistic war cry and leapt onto the troll\'s back. The beast didn\'t even seem to notice, it was so focused upon Ron. Neville seemed completely unsure what to do, so he withdrew his wand and --- with as much force as he could muster --- drove it straight up the creature\'s nose as far as it went.

The thing howled in pain and threw Ron backwards, writhing as the implement seemed to rub against its very brain. Blood was streaming from its nose like a grotesque waterfall, staining the bathroom floor like a dark wine might a fine piece of clothing. Neville gritted his teeth and, with every bit of force he could muster, pushed a little bit further, trying to channel magic through the mechanism as he did so.

The wand met resistance for but a second before it snapped with a crack that echoed through the bathroom like a broken branch in a noiseless forest. There was an explosion of raw energy so blindingly bright that Ron and the others were left blinking spots from their eyes for several minutes, though they had no trouble hearing the deafening thump of the troll\'s body hitting the floor, nor the way the lone remaining sink precariously shook on the wall.

After they could all see once more, they noticed at once that the troll was indeed slumped, unmoving on the floor and that Neville\'s wand was lying near its head in two pieces.

\"My wand! Dad\'s wand... Gran\'s gonna kill me!\"

\"Is... is it dead?\" Hermione asked at the same time.

Before Ron could even try to answer, the bathroom\'s entrance slammed open and professors Dumbledore, Quirrell, Flitwick, McGonagall, and Snape burst through the door, wands outstretched.

Ron could only wonder exactly how in the name of Merlin they were going to talk their way out of this one.

**Author\'s Endnote:**

**I know it sort of seems that Ron is just canon Harry right now, but I have a lot of character growth planned. He resembles first-year Harry in canon at the moment because, frankly, Harry was the definition of a cookie-cutter Gryffindor, and Ron is sort of that for now. If anything, it should show you that I have no plans of needlessly bashing Ron, and I hope you enjoy his arc in the story.**

***The Headmaster\'s Office***

***9:00 PM***

The headmaster\'s office at Hogwarts was situated in one of the highest towers. It was a circular, ornate room; one that was dotted with the marks of its owner\'s eccentricities.

The current master of this office was a very complicated man. Thus, the room was dotted with a large number of odd-looking instruments; many of them being just as complex and eccentric as the man who owned and, in some cases, had created them.

The man himself was sitting behind the large polished desk, whose surface he was drumming his fingers on. The drumming seemed to be to a rhythm only the old man himself could hear. On a perch not far from the desk, an immaculate bird was sleeping.

Over the perch sat an ornate clock that made perfect sense to the wizened old warlock behind the desk. To most people, the clock would mean nothing. Which was rather ironic, because it was much less complicated than it looked.

Around its exterior, brilliant stars were situated in positions not unlike the numbers on a typical grandfather clock. In its centre, planets slowly orbited an illustrated sun. Most of them simply stayed in their orbit all the time, but two of them broke the designation to float out of line, much closer to the stars dotted around the clock\'s perimeter.

The clock glowed softly as Saturn shifted to align with a star that was, to muggles, in place of where one might expect the number nine to rest. In unison, Pluto aligned with the topmost star.

Almost as if the whole thing had been choreographed, there came a knock from the room\'s door before the clock\'s glow had faded.

\"Enter,\" called the man behind the desk, gently sliding a stack of parchments into one of the drawers nearest him.

The door opened and in stepped a sallow-skinned man with dark eyes and long, black hair. Without prompting, he stepped forward and took his seat across from the venerable headmaster, who straightened up once his parchments had been restored to their proper resting place.

\"Ah, Severus. You are as punctual as ever. I thank you for your promptness in agreeing to such an impromptu meeting.\"

\"Frankly, Headmaster, I would have been concerned had you not called a meeting after tonight\'s... events.\"

\"Yes, it has been quite the evening, hasn\'t it?\" When Snape\'s expression did not so much as shift, Dumbledore frowned slightly. \"I see you are not in the mood for small talk, so I will deliberate no longer.\"

\"Quirrell is after the stone,\" Snape said in a flat tone of voice.

\"Hmm,\" mused Dumbledore. \"An interesting hypothesis. What do you have to support such a claim?\"

\"He is not the man he was when he once taught at this school. I remember Quirrell as a young, naive fool who was filled with all the delusions of a perfect, harmonious world. If what I have heard about his lessons are at all true, his views have shifted.\" His lip curled. \"As has his degree of competency. Yet only when teaching my Slytherins, it would seem. According to three-fourths of the school, he is a bumbling buffoon without a hope of getting through a lecture.\"

\"What of tonight\'s events then? I will remind you that Quirinus was present with myself and the others throughout the whole ordeal.\"

\"He used Filch. The Imperius Curse, I suspect, though we of course can\'t prove it.\"

\"And what do you think his intention was?\"

\"The stone,\" Snape reiterated. \"I don\'t know if you noticed, but Filch was gone from the hall before you even left it.\"

\"I did notice that, yes. It was quite curious, wasn\'t it?\"

Snape pointedly ignored the question. \"As I told you when exiting the hall, I took the time to check up on the third-floor corridor. Imagine my surprise when I saw Filch attempting to open the door.\"

Dumbledore\'s eyebrow rose. \"Open the door? He would have needed the ability to channel magic to do such a thing.\"

\"Or an enchanted knife which can unlock any door that is not hidden behind the most potent of wards.\" Snape levelled Dumbledore with an intense glare. \"Which, as it so happens, is apparently not the case for this door. For what ungodly reason, I do not know.\"

\"So you think Quirinus meant to have Argus retrieve the Philosopher\'s Stone?\"

\"Not likely. Not with the knowledge that all of the professors have set traps to prevent one from doing just that. He would have to be more foolish than I remember him to think a squib capable of such a thing. I think it much more likely that he was using Filch as a method of surveillance.\" His stare turned accusatory. \"Something I think you are somehow well aware of.\"

Dumbledore nodded slowly. \"Yes,\" he said with the air of one discussing the next day\'s weather. \"I believe that to be a perfectly reasonable and altogether likely conclusion to the night\'s events.\"

\"Yet you do nothing?\"

\"Oh, I am doing something, I assure you. There is an artifact on the way which will make Quirinus, or anyone else for that matter, much less likely candidates of ever being able to steal the Philosopher\'s Stone.\"

\"What is this artifact?\"

\"I cannot say. I trust you completely, but there are some things I cannot speak of. Increasing the probability of a leak would be foolish.\"

\"You think I would leak your secret or that any would be capable of pulling it from my mind?\"

\"I am certain you would never do such a thing and I very much doubt the latter to be possible. I do much prefer to err on the side of caution, however, especially when dealing with such sensitive matters as the one we have at hand.\"

Snape\'s face was set in a hard line and his jaw was clenched very tightly. \"Very well,\" he said curtly. \"And what will happen until the artifact arrives?\"

\"I doubt a move will be made on the Philosopher\'s Stone before that time comes. I find the possibility to be slim to none.\"

\"And if you\'re wrong?\"

\"I think the cerberus will act as quite a strong deterrent. They are exceptionally rare creatures and their weaknesses are not well-known.\"

\"And if Quirrell discovers the creature\'s weakness?\"

\"The only people in the world with the knowledge of how to surpass this particular cerberus are myself and Hagrid. I am certainly not telling, and I find the possibility of Rubeus sharing that secret with Quirinus an altogether unlikely one.\"

Snape sneered, suddenly reminded of his now mangled leg. It had been patched up by Madam Pomfrey and he was currently enjoying the benefits of a pain-relief potion; he knew exactly how formidable that beast was.

As for the staff\'s ability to keep its weakness under wraps... he was less confident.

\"I cannot decide whether your optimism is more enviable than it is nauseating, or more nauseating than it is enviable. It is certainly naive above all else.\"

Dumbledore smiled thinly. \"I sometimes think you overestimate that optimism, Severus. I do admittedly tend to see the best in most people but, if you will forgive me saying, I usually tend to know far more about those people than the individuals judging them so unjustly.\"

Realizing this argument was lost, Snape changed tact. \"Speaking of judgement, do you buy the story put forth by Weasley, Longbottom, and Granger?\"

\"I think most of it is likely the truth. If the Longbottom heir really has been using his father\'s wand all this time, that certainly explains some of the concerns his professors have voiced. It is fortunate that he didn\'t use it longer. While the effects wouldn\'t have been detrimental, they might have been noticeable, under the precisely wrong circumstances.\" His eyes twinkled. \"As for Miss Granger running off after a mountain troll, I find the tale as amusing as it is unlikely, though I admit I know little of the girl.\"

\"I didn\'t believe a word of her fairytale.\"

\"No, I certainly wouldn\'t have expected you to. Nevertheless, the youngest Weasley is proving to be quite the interesting addition to Hogwarts.\"

\"He is interesting in the same way those juvenile demons he calls brothers are interesting. Interesting in the sense that they are deafeningly loud, sickeningly brash, and excessively chaotic without reason.\"

Dumbledore chuckled. \"Juvenile demons, did you call them?\" Snape nodded stiffly. \"An interesting profile for certain. I much prefer to think of them as particularly gifted students doing a remarkable job at playing the role of jester, but perhaps that\'s just me.\"

\"No matter what you want to call them, trouble seems to follow in their very wake. The youngest boy is no exception. The path of carnage he has left behind him in two months puts him on pace to top his brothers\' own performances, which is the last thing this school needs, especially now, of all years.\" His face twisted into something ugly. \"I would have expected this from Potter, but Weasley is proving more troublesome than I would like.\"

\"Ah yes, Harry. Such an interesting case. I have heard glowing reports from most of his professors, but you have yet to say a word on him in my presence. Truly, Severus, that is something I did not expect. Tell me, what do you think of him?\"

\"He has no gift for Potions. He is not an erumpent horn waiting to explode, but he is far from skillful. In that regard, he takes much more after his *father* than his mother.\"

The way Snape carefully enunciated and emphasized every syllable of the word \'father\' spoke volumes to how --- even now, years later --- he felt about the man in question.

Dumbledore\'s thin smile returned. \"I have seen the grades you have given him. This much, I could have judged on my own. I wanted to know what you thought of the boy. Not what you thought of the student.\"

\"He is... quiet,\" Snape admitted. \"He rarely speaks in my classroom and frankly, I am not nearly as starstruck by his imaginary prestige as the rest of you. I have much better things to do than spending my day constantly observing some overhyped brat.\"

Dumbledore\'s lips twitched. \"Naturally.\" He glanced back up at his clock. \"Is that all for tonight?\"

\"Why is the door not more carefully warded?\"

\"The Hogwarts wards are quite complex. Tying potent wards into the already present ward scheme would be no small feat.\" Both men knew all too well Dumbledore could do it if the need truly arose, but the man wasn\'t finished. \"More troubling, I am obligated to inform the Hogwarts Board of Governors about any large-scale changes I make in regards to the wards.\"

A look of knowing passed between the two men and Snape inclined his head, though his expression was tight.

\"Very well,\" he said shortly, standing to his feet. \"That will be all then.\"

\"Do continue to keep an eye on Quirinus,\" Dumbledore said idly as he pulled the stack of parchments back out from their place in the drawer. \"Especially whilst he is near young Harry.\"

\"I will be watching,\" Snape vowed, stepping out of the office with a contemplative expression marring his features.

What exactly was the real reason Dumbledore wasn\'t putting up more complex wards?

***November 2, 1991***

***The Entrance Hall***

***8:11 PM***

The sun had long since set by the time Neville returned to Hogwarts. He had been in Diagon Alley getting a new wand; one that was given the opportunity to choose him.

When his grandmother had first learned of the destruction of his father\'s wand, she had been far from pleased. Neville had been in Professor McGonagall\'s office when his Head of House had made the floo call, and his gran had looked for a second as though she might spout flames with the intensity of a Hungarian Horntail.

Professor McGonagall had succinctly explained the events leading up to the destruction of Frank Longbottom\'s wand whilst Neville cowered in a corner, just barely in sight of his gran\'s head in the fire. To his astonishment, her tone shifted almost as soon as she learned of what had actually happened. She was still clearly distraught about her son\'s wand being no more, but there was something else in her eyes and voice. It somehow seemed more positive to Neville. She had never looked at him in that way before, but it made him feel warm in a way he was not accustomed to.

Mr. Ollivander had been most pleased to see him. The old man\'s memory really must have been impeccable, for he mentioned having expected Neville back in August. That only made the first-year Gryffindor boy wonder whether or not Ollivander kept track of every child\'s birthday and when they would be starting Hogwarts. He supposed he might have only been doing it for the politically powerful or otherwise important children, but he somehow doubted it. Ollivander didn\'t really seem the type to spend that much time on politics.

Despite the old man\'s eccentricities, Neville had never been so happy as when his hand had closed around his new wand. It was made of cherry and the core was the tail hair from an old and majestic unicorn. That\'s what Ollivander had said, anyway. The surge of warmth that rushed up Neville\'s arm and filled his chest felt almost as though a miniature firework had been lit inside of him. It was an incredible feeling and it was one he had never experienced with his father\'s wand, which made him oddly sad.

He would still make the man proud. He was just doing it with a different wand. He liked to think Frank Longbottom would have wanted his son to succeed, and Neville had a feeling things were going to work just a little bit better this way. He was sure he wasn\'t suddenly going to turn into Merlin or any such nonsense, but he also had little doubt it would help. Especially after what Mr. Ollivander had said about the wand choosing the wizard. He had stressed quite strongly it did not work the other way around.

When they had finished, Augusta had elected for a meal at the Three Broomsticks in Hogsmeade as opposed to flooing Neville directly back into the castle.

She walked him up towards the oak front doors when they had finished, and Neville couldn\'t help but notice how bright the grounds nearest to the castle were in contrast to the rest of the land around them. The hundreds of lights streaming down from windows far above might as well have been rays of sunlight, so bright they were when their beams conjoined.

After hugging his gran goodbye and stepping into the Entrance Hall, Neville\'s face broke out into a wide grin at the sight before him.

Ron and Hermione were standing outside the Great Hall, obviously having waited there since the conclusion of dinner.

It was odd how quickly the three of them had come together in the two days since their fight against the troll. Ron and Neville had been friendly before then, but they hadn\'t exactly been friends, per se. Hermione had been an outsider altogether, and she had most definitely not spent time talking to Ron. Least of all after his rule-breaking nature had made him the youngest seeker in a century.

But some things just brought people together in odd ways that could never be explained. Apparently, fighting a fully-grown mountain troll together was one of them. They had basically been fused at the hips ever since and it filled Neville with a great deal of warmth to think of how things had changed so quickly.

As did the eager, curious expressions they wore, obviously wondering how his trip to Diagon Alley had gone.

Things were really starting to look up for Neville at Hogwarts.

\"Hey, mate,\" Ron said in a low whisper. \"We have something to tell you.\"

Neville\'s ears perked up. \"Oh?\"

\"Snape\'s leg is a mess... and we think we know what happened.\"

And just like that, Neville\'s year became far more complicated once again.

***November 9, 1991***

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***4:23 PM***

Harry\'s first time watching Quidditch was an experience he wasn\'t likely to forget. The horde of Hogwarts students that had ascended into the stands quickly split off into four sections, each of them holding the members of one of the four Hogwarts houses. This was not a requirement in any way, shape, or form, but it was done in such a routine manner that Harry could only assume it to be a long-standing tradition.

He took his seat with Draco and the others high in the Slytherin section. They had a bird\'s eye view of the pitch, and Harry watched and cheered loudly along with the rest of his housemates when Slytherin\'s Quidditch team streaked out onto the pitch --- being announced as the reigning champions of the past six years as they did so. Much of the school booed crassly, and Harry was forcefully reminded of what Diana had said to him about Slytherin\'s disadvantages and the house loyalty they inspired whilst the two of them had stood atop the handsome balcony.

Harry watched, transfixed, as the players all mounted their brooms at centre field and took to the sky.

It was like nothing he had ever seen before.

The figures high above shot through the air at such ludicrous speeds that Harry could barely make out some of them beyond distinguishing between green and red blurs. He was thankful he had read a bit about Quidditch during the summer, or else he might have been very lost. The rules weren\'t terribly complicated --- except for the ridiculous number of small technicalities that were seldom relevant --- but he thought he would have been so entranced by the magic of the game that he may never have grasped its rules without prior knowledge.

Less magical was the game\'s outcome, at least for Harry\'s liking.

It was clear that Slytherin was good, but it was just as painstakingly obvious that Gryffindor was just better. Their chasers played with coordination that left Harry dumbstruck. It was as if they knew where each other were at all times without looking. Slytherin\'s beaters --- two hulking boys named Derrick and Bole --- were so outclassed by the Weasley twins it was almost comical. Bletchley actually was a very good keeper, from what Harry could tell, but he was clearly no match for Oliver Wood.

And then there was Ron Weasley, who looked exceptionally nervous but slowly eased his way into the game.

Early on, he had tried to jump into the play and act as a fourth chaser. This was perfectly legal, except he didn\'t do it very well. It was clear he had the talent, he just played so erratically that he was more of a detriment than he was a help. He did eventually ease into the game but even then, he reacted to every small movement that Slytherin\'s seeker --- a seventh-year boy named Terence Higgs --- made. Draco rightfully pointed out that all Higgs would need to do was feint Weasley into the ground. At least, that sounded pretty good to Harry. He didn\'t know what it meant exactly, but it sounded impactful and useful, if a bit difficult.

Despite his shakiness, the youngest seeker in a century was obviously leaps and bounds ahead of Higgs in terms of pure flying ability.

Granted, pure flying ability was not what allowed him to make the rather bizarre catch that ended the game. As Draco would put it later, it was \"The single easiest catch I have ever seen.\" He had also called Weasley a talentless troll for not realizing what had happened. Harry wasn\'t sure about that last part, but it was a one-off jab, so he let it go.

The snitch had apparently flown up Weasley\'s sleeve as he dodged a bludger sent towards him by Matthew Derrick. He had flown around the pitch for at least another minute before realizing, and only because the snitch had become bored and sought to fly out of his sleeve. Weasley had made a wild swipe for it and actually missed, but he did manage to snag it on the second attempt and before Higgs could swoop down and steal it from him.

\"Ridiculous,\" sulked Draco once they had later returned to the Slytherin common room. \"Honestly, Higgs is completely useless! How do you lose to a seeker who doesn\'t even realize the snitch flew up his sleeve?\" Crabbe and Goyle snickered. \"Seriously,\" Draco went on, \"the idiot *still* almost fumbled the catch.\" His eyes gleamed. \"Next year, when I\'m on the team, I\'ll be sure to make sure Weasley realizes exactly how rubbish he really is. He\'ll learn he\'s just a worthless little blood traitor with a bit of luck.\"

\"Confident, are we?\" Theodore asked with a thin smile.

\"I don\'t need to be confident. Not when I\'m flying against a bumbling buffoon on a broom.\"

Pansy laughed along with Crabbe and Goyle. Theodore\'s thin smile stretched just a little bit, but Harry\'s did not.

\"Oi!\" said Draco. \"Where are you off to?\"

\"I just need a bit of air is all,\" lied Harry. \"I\'ve got a bad headache that I\'m gonna try and get rid of.\"

\"I can come with you,\" Pansy offered at once.

\"It\'s okay. Like I said, I have a headache. It might actually be best if you don\'t.\"

He didn\'t even make it all the way down the corridor before he sensed that he was being followed. This time, he wasn\'t nearly as surprised to see Diana following him.

\"I can leave if you\'d like,\" she offered. \"I heard what you told my brother, but I thought you might have just been making an excuse to get away. I\'ll leave if you actually have a headache.\"

\"It\'s... okay,\" Harry said unsurely.

He didn\'t have a headache at all, but he wasn\'t sure whether or not he wanted to be alone or whether he wanted the older girl\'s company. The one indisputable positive about this way was that he could ask her questions and hopefully have them answered.

\"What\'s a blood traitor?\"

Diana\'s step faltered for but a second before she regained her composure. It seemed to Harry that they were on the path back to the balcony they had spoken on last time they had shared one of these moments.

\"It\'s... a derogatory term used by traditionalists to describe certain witches or wizards.\"

Harry frowned. \"I sort of figured that part out, but what does it mean?\"

\"It\'s... complicated.\" She seemed to choose her words very carefully as they ascended the stairs out of the dungeons. \"How much do you know about wizarding traditions?\"

Harry thought about that for a moment. \"Not as much as I\'d like,\" he admitted. \"I know that a lot of purebloods call Halloween Samhain, and I know that Yule is used instead of Christmas.\"

\"Those are good examples. Basic, but good. Others would be some of the more formal etiquette and whatnot.\" Harry nodded along. \"Well, a family like mine takes traditions very seriously. We follow all of the old rites and my mother, in particular, is very strict about etiquette. It\'s one of the first things Draco and I were ever taught.\" Harry nodded once more. \"Some families, like mine, hold these traditions very closely, and it upsets some purebloods when others don\'t follow them.\" She frowned. \"Even more so when people actively go against those traditions.\"

\"So is that what a blood traitor is?\"

\"Basically, yes. It\'s a witch or wizard raised in our world who ignores or, in some cases, goes against our traditions.\" Diana peered warily towards him as they stepped through the passage that would lead them out onto the balcony they had occupied during their last conversation. \"I\'m guessing Draco said it about Weasley?\"

\"He did, yeah. He\'s... not pleased.\"

Diana laughed quietly. \"No, I doubt he is. Most in our house aren\'t pleased, but I bet Draco is extra annoyed. He seemed to think father would be able to get him a spot on the house team, even though --- at least until Weasley --- no first year had even been allowed a tryout in decades. None of them had actually made the team in a century.\"

\"Yeah, he called him a talentless troll.\"

Diana laughed once more as the two of them stepped out into the cool November air. \"It was a *very* lucky catch, but I don\'t know if I\'d go that far. He\'s a good flyer; he just needs to calm down a bit.\" Harry nodded.

\"All of the Weasleys are called blood traitors by a lot of purebloods,\" Diana eventually told him. \"They go against all of the pureblood ways, their children never follow any of the etiquette, from what I can tell, and their lord is Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.\"

\"The... what?\" Harry had read up a bit on the ministry and he was sure this was a part of it, but he hadn\'t heard it mentioned. It just sounded like an overly ostentatious position that a self-important governing body would come up with.

\"The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office,\" Diana explained with a smile that was obviously threatening to become a laugh. \"I\'m not surprised you\'ve never heard of it. It\'s a sub-branch of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Everything I\'ve heard about it makes it sound next to useless. Father says their office is literally an old broom cupboard, but I\'m not sure if he was being serious.\"

\"That sounds awful!\"

Diana shrugged. \"As I said, the office sounds pretty useless. They don\'t seem to do much. Father says it\'s a wonder the ministry even funds them. Either way, the lord of House Weasley, Arthur, is the department\'s head. He\'s obsessed with anything and everything muggle if what I\'ve heard is true. Father calls him the ultimate blood traitor from time to time.\"

\"Is the word... wrong?\"

Diana seemed to think about that. \"Wrong in what way?\"

\"Like... should we be saying it?\"

\"It\'s not the kindest word. There are worse ones, but it\'s bad enough to offend someone.\" She hesitated. \"I don\'t know if it\'s wrong though. The meaning is pretty on point. There are a lot of families who go completely against the old ways. Arguments can be made that it\'s done a lot of bad for the world. I\'m sure there are arguments the other way too, but if the term is wrong or not in terms of what it means is sort of up to the person.\"

That explanation made some sense to Harry, though he had no idea how he felt about the word\'s validity. He couldn\'t comprehend why anyone would act more muggle than wizard, but he wasn\'t sure if that made it right.

Every muggle he had ever met had been at least partially an awful human being. Except for some spiteful Gryffindors, most of the witches and wizards Harry had met were miles nicer than any of the muggles. If he had his pick, he was going wizard all the way, and he couldn\'t think for the life of him why anybody would choose differently. He could actually see why it annoyed some wizards. It implied they were worse off than muggles, which, judging on how horrid muggles were, was something Harry thought them at least a bit justified in being upset over.

Whether that made the term right or not... he wasn\'t sure.

\"If you want to learn more about traditions, I\'d be happy to help.\" Diana smiled at Harry\'s eager-looking expression. \"I\'m sure my parents would, too. They told me to pass along an invitation to come over for the Yuletide break.\"

Harry\'s heart leapt into his throat. No... that wasn\'t a strong enough analogy. Harry\'s heart almost leapt out of his mouth.

\"They... they did?\"

Diana nodded, a sad smile playing at the corners of her lips. \"They did, yes. They\'re actually eager to meet you for more than a couple of minutes on a train platform. I think they\'re going to send a letter about it to Professor Snape, just so he knows what to expect.\"

\"They\'re... sure?\"

Diana fixed Harry with a hard stare. \"Just because those muggles treated you so horribly, that doesn\'t mean the rest of us will.\"

Her voice was soft and confident and it very obviously brook no argument. Harry found it difficult to believe such things at all, but her tone almost made him believe it anyway.

\"They were horrible people,\" continued Diana. \"I don\'t know what they did, but I don\'t need to know. I haven\'t seen anything bad about you. Anyone who would treat a child like that is a monster.\"

Harry nearly leapt out of his skin when her hand landed on his shoulder. He tensed, which made Diana frown, but she left her hand firmly in place.

\"You\'re in a better place now. None of us are going to treat you that way. You might be my brother\'s best friend, and I\'ve gotten along really well with you too. Hell, even Cassius likes you, and Cassius doesn\'t like most people.\" She giggled at this last part. \"He actually looked annoyed about it. Anyway, the point is, you\'re wanted here. There\'s no need to look so surprised.\"

Numbly, Harry nodded.

\"If you\'re ready,\" said Diana, removing her hand from his shoulder and turning back towards the castle\'s interior, \"we should get back inside. It\'s cold out here.\"

Harry nodded and they began the descent back down into the dungeons.

***The Potions Classroom***

***11:58 AM***

The sound of simmering cauldrons began to die as the Potions class came to an end. With it went the vapour that had been hanging seductively around the room, looming persistently in the air.

\"Potter!\" snapped their Head of House. \"Stay behind!\"

Harry and Snape\'s relationship since that first Potions lesson back in September could accurately be described as uneventful. Whenever possible, it seemed as though Snape tried to pretend that Harry didn\'t exist. Harry thought this was blatantly unfair.

Draco, Pansy, Theodore, and basically anyone who so much as breathed whilst wearing Slytherin robes had points showered on them with the frequency of falling raindrops. Harry, on the other hand, rarely heard so much as a word from the Potions Master. It was better than the horrendous treatment of the Gryffindors, but Harry wouldn\'t have been at all opposed to receiving the same preferential treatment that was enjoyed by every other member of his house.

He often wondered what he had done to offend Snape in the first place. He only ever remembered being respectful, but he somehow thought he was missing something. Even at the welcoming feast, before Harry had ever even spoken a word to the man, Snape had seemed poised and ready to despise him on principle. He supposed being blatantly ignored was better than that, but it did make him a bit bitter.

Harry found himself terribly surprised that Friday morning after he was called to stay behind after their double period. It was most unlike Snape based on the trend of pretending Harry didn\'t exist, and he suddenly wondered if something catastrophic had happened. He couldn\'t think why else Snape might have called for a meeting, of sorts.

\"You wanted to speak with me, sir?\"

Snape\'s lip curled. \"Wanted is a strong word, but I think there is something you should at least be made aware of.\" He slid open one of the drawers on his desk and withdrew a pristine-looking envelope from inside. \"This,\" he said, \"is a letter I received from Lucius Malfoy on Wednesday. I was... surprised to learn that he had invited you to spend the Yuletide break at his home.\" Snape levelled him with a hard gaze. \"It would be advisable for you to send him a letter professing your... intense appreciation.\"

Harry nodded quickly just as he noticed Snape\'s expression become more pensive. \"I think it prudent for me to inform you that accepting Lord Malfoy\'s invitation may not be quite as simple as you might think.\"

Harry felt confusion bubble in the pit of his stomach. \"What do you mean, sir?\"

\"What I mean, Potter, is that you will not be permitted to leave this castle for extended periods of time without the expressed permission of your legal guardians. That doesn\'t suddenly change because of the holiday season being in full swing.\"

Dread closed tightly around Harry\'s throat. It seemed to do its best to strangle him, as he felt all of the air torn painfully and suddenly from his lungs.

He would need to get the Dursleys\' permission to go to Malfoy Manor.

One of the things he had most looked forward to about entering into the wizarding world was the fact the Dursleys would no longer have power over him. Finding out that fact wasn\'t true was actually far more crushing than the likely implications that he would be unable to accept the Malfoys\' invitation.

\"I suggest you write to your relatives,\" said Snape. \"Do so quickly; time is running out. Official words must be given on your holiday plans in the coming weeks.\"

Harry nodded morosely as he was carelessly dismissed. He wondered if Snape understood just how crushing that proclamation had been. Or, if he did, whether or not he even cared.

***November 21, 1991***

***The Library***

***7:52 PM***

Harry found himself the only member of his group in the library the Thursday after his post-Potions discussion with Snape. The Dursleys had not yet written back. Not that their answer was even remotely in doubt. The only thing that had Harry vaguely curious was whether or not they would dignify him with a response. He quietly thought they would, if only to spite him needlessly. It seemed like exactly the sort of thing Uncle Vernon would do.

Tonight, he was alone in the library because Theodore had wanted to practice spells that night. Ironically, Harry actually did have quite the nasty migraine this time. Of course, staring down at a book wasn\'t particularly conducive to ridding himself of the ailment, but it was better than the cacophony of noise that was likely filling whichever room his friends were using to house their practice.

Harry was just looking over a book on Charms when a high, squeaky voice rang out from behind him.

\"I\'m glad to see that you\'re taking an interest in the theory of Charms.\" Harry nearly jumped out of his chair, but he managed to maintain the vast majority of his composure. Flitwick obviously noticed, for he offered Harry an apologetic smile. \"So sorry, dear boy. I didn\'t mean to scare you. Just making an observation was all.\"

\"It\'s okay, Professor,\" said Harry, feeling his heart rate slow back down to a more reasonable cadence. \"I just didn\'t expect you, that\'s all.\"

Flitwick smiled conspiratorially. \"Believe it or not, there are a great many books in this library. I doubt even Albus has come close to reading all of them. I am also a Ravenclaw at heart, so I spend more time taking books out from here than you might expect.\"

Harry nodded slowly; it made sense. \"What were you saying about the theory, sir?\"

\"Ah yes, that,\" said Flitwick, straightening his posture and suddenly looking quite satisfied. \"You are a remarkable student. I know Minerva has told you as much as well, and I wouldn\'t doubt Quirinus has done the same.\" Harry blushed, but Flitwick either didn\'t notice or was too polite to point it out. Harry was hedging his bets on the latter.

\"You are exceptionally talented. I would go as far as to say you have an intuitive sense for magic, which is something that I seldom see. You have been a joy to teach, but your standing in my class should actually be much higher than it is.\"

Harry felt some concern solidify in his chest as he stared worriedly back towards Flitwick. \"Is it not good, Professor?\"

Flitwick chuckled. \"Oh, it is excellent, but it should be much better. As we speak, I believe you\'re on a similar footing to Miss Granger; maybe just a touch or two above her.\"

\"That\'s good?\"

\"You\'re the top two students for your year in my class, Harry.\"

He frowned. \"Then how could it be better?\"

\"Because, with all due respect to Miss Granger, the two of you should not be close. She is remarkably intelligent; one of the brightest minds I have ever had the pleasure of teaching. Very determined, too, and she has such a curious mind.\" Flitwick looked pointedly from Harry to the book sitting in front of him on the desk. \"What she doesn\'t have is your ability. You are very far ahead in the practical side of Charms, but there is more to magic than waving your wand and making things happen. Understanding magic is just as important as using it. That\'s what lets you push further as a wizard. It\'s what lets you evolve, mature, and truly master magic. Without the understanding, you will go only as far as your classes and textbooks take you.\"

\"Is my theory work not good, sir?\"

\"It\'s more than passable, but it is very far behind what I would expect from someone of your ability.\" His look turned reassuring when he saw Harry\'s own face fall. \"Your grades are still exceptional on the count of your theory alone, Master Potter. All that I am saying is that you have the potential to be something more. You have the potential to be so much more. It is potential you won\'t ever reach without putting in the work to truly understand the magic. I would hate to see such potential go to waste, and I\'m sure your other professors would tell you the same thing.\"

He was right, of course. Just last week, Harry had performed the Transfiguration they had been assigned with ease. Professor McGonagall had praised him. She had awarded him points and even compared him to his father; who had apparently been some sort of prodigy in the subject. What she had also said echoed what Professor Flitwick said.

\"*If your theoretical work ever catches up to your practical ability, you will doubtlessly be the most talented student I have ever taught.\"*

Harry remembered his conversation with Diana about the term \'blood traitor\'. He remembered how during that conversation, he had wondered why one wouldn\'t want to learn all they could about the magical world and immerse themselves in its culture. This was his home. He wanted it to be his home more badly than he wanted anything else in the entire world. He wanted to differentiate himself from the muggles as much as he possibly could.

He could think of no better way to do that than to understand the one thing they themselves could never wield.

\"I\'ll try harder, Professor,\" Harry vowed. \"I\'ll do my best to better understand.\"

Flitwick smiled warmly right before he exited the room. \"Jolly good! Do come to me if you ever have any questions.\"

Then, he left.

***December 1, 1991***

***The Headmaster\'s Office***

***8:44 PM***

Albus Dumbledore looked up from his letter with a passive yet pleased expression.

\"Very good,\" he mused, looking to his phoenix, who seemed to be eyeing him with what he thought resembled curiosity. \"It is on the way,\" he told it with a soft smile, eliciting a soft note of ethereal music from the bird.

That single note warmed Dumbledore more than he could describe. His very blood seemed to heat up as his skin tingled.

But even that didn\'t warm nor assure him as much as the contents of his letter.

The mirror would arrive soon.

***December 9, 1991***

***The Great Hall***

***8:41 AM***

The layer of snow which had blanketed Hogwarts for some time now had thickened over the past week or so. There had been two fairly significant snowfalls and by now, Harry would easily concede that there was more snow at Hogwarts than he had ever seen at one time in his life.

Aside from that, not much had changed inside the castle.

He had taken Flitwick\'s advice and spent more time studying magical theory, and he had immediately noticed some increases in his practical work, even if they were --- at least for now --- marginal. He actually understood the concepts without a terrible degree of difficulty after looking into them, it was just a matter of actually doing so. He didn\'t plan on exerting that much effort into classes such as Astronomy, but it did seem to be an admittedly valid way for him to progress in the wanded subjects.

Otherwise, the norm had largely been maintained.

His group of friends remained mostly the same. There had been a week or so after Harry\'s conversation with Diana during which Draco had been a touch withdrawn. This mirrored a similar instance earlier in the year after their first conversation pertaining to Draco\'s treatment of Neville Longbottom and Ron Weasley. This stretch had been awkward both times, but Draco had gotten over it quickly enough. Harry was beginning to see a pattern and he suspected that Diana was likely having words with her younger brother. What those words were, exactly, he was unsure.

Snape was making his way down the Slytherin table this morning and it only took Harry a couple of seconds to realize why. The time had come for students to specify whether or not they would be remaining in the castle over the winter break. It was a day Harry had been dreading for some time. Ever since Snape had informed him of the Dursleys\' necessary involvement in him leaving the castle, but especially since their return letter had arrived just a few days later.

It was curt but had stated in no uncertain terms that they would not be going out of their way to sign any forms for him. Obviously desiring to save themselves another letter, they had enclosed Harry\'s Christmas gift early --- a fifty-pence piece --- as well as a postscript telling him to ask whether or not it would be possible for him to remain at Hogwarts over the summer holidays.

It was perhaps the first bit of agreeable advice the Dursleys had ever given him. If the option to do just that was there, Harry would absolutely be taking it.

He loved the castle and would crave nothing more than using it to escape the Dursleys forever, but he presently felt unsatisfied at Hogwarts for the first time since his arrival.

Perhaps unsatisfied wasn\'t the right word.

It just felt wrong staying while almost all of his friends were returning home for the holidays. The lone exception to the rule was Cassius Warrington, with whom Harry had formed a tentative friendship ever since the older boy had seen Harry fly.

Writing his regretful letter to the Malfoys stating that he would be unable to accept their invitation of hospitality had been painful, but telling Draco was going to be even worse. It was something Harry had thus far put off, but with Snape parading around the table, list in hand, the time for procrastination had unfortunately come to an abrupt and sudden end.

Snape noted down the plans for all of Harry\'s friends before turning to him. Harry could tell Snape was somehow interested in the answer, even though his face was as blank as ever. \"And you, Potter?\"

\"I\'ll be staying at Hogwarts, sir.\"

\"What?\" asked Draco, head snapping around so fast his blonde hair flew across his forehead.

\"The muggles didn\'t sign the form,\" Harry muttered, doing so in a voice quiet enough that he hoped no one else would hear.

\"That\'s rubbish,\" said Draco, turning pleading eyes on Snape. \"You\'re hearing this, Professor? Surely a bunch of muggles can\'t tell the Boy-Who-Lived where he can and can\'t stay for Yule.\"

\"I\'m afraid they can, Mister Malfoy. By law, they are his guardians, thus Hogwarts must bow to their wishes in such matters.\"

\"What if I appealed to my father?\"

\"It would do nothing in such a short time. So long as they are his guardians, nothing is to be done.\" Snape swept off before Draco could get in another retort.

\"Tossers,\" he cursed under his breath, his grey eyes stormy and filled with obvious fury. \"I\'m really sorry, Harry. I can still try to write Father. Snape is a teacher; he\'s no solicitor. Maybe he\'s overlooked something.\"

\"Thanks, Draco, but it\'s okay. I wouldn\'t want to bother your father with something like this.\"

Draco opened his mouth, obviously intent on arguing, but didn\'t get a chance to begin.

\"Let it drop, Malfoy.\" The voice came from a boy whom Harry didn\'t know by name, but whom he thought to be a second year. \"If the halfblood\'s own family doesn\'t even want him, I doubt a man like your father would ever be bothered.\"

Harry felt as though he had been slapped.

He was no fool; he had gauged the mood just fine after his sorting into Slytherin. The opinions were heavily divided --- even within his own house. He was pretty sure that had it not been for his friendship with Draco, Theodore, and Pansy, he would have had a much more difficult time than he had been having so far. Even so, he saw the way some of the students looked at him. They were mostly upper years, but their expressions did not exactly speak positive things. Harry could vividly remember thinking that the stare levelled at him by one particular upper-year girl looked very much like how he might study an excessively slimy bug.

Harry must have given away at least some of his thoughts through his expression, because the boy\'s lips curled up into a malicious smirk.

\"Oh, come on, Potter. Surely you\'re not daft enough to think you\'re special just because you have a stupid scar? I know your yearmates have been all buddy-buddy, but we don\'t usually put up with your type here.\"

\"My type?\" asked Harry, doing an admirable job at keeping his voice steady.

\"The son of a blood traitor and a mudblood.\"

Harry felt an odd twinge of anger at this boy\'s words. Conceptually, he knew it was irrational. He had never known either of his parents and he had no memories of them except for what he suspected to be his mother\'s final moments. That somehow still didn\'t change the fact that anger pulsed within him at these last words, never mind the fact he didn\'t know what a mudblood was.

His hand twitched towards his wand, but he resisted the impulse. The boy\'s friends were eyeing the situation warily, and Harry doubted they could take a group of second years. Even if they could, an open duel in the Great Hall likely wouldn\'t go over well at all.

Somebody came up behind the boy and rested a hand on his shoulder. He turned to see who it was before suddenly sobering. \"Fawley.\"

\"Travers,\" the girl returned, her eyes flitting between him and Harry. \"Let\'s not spout off about blood supremacy in the Great Hall, yes? It doesn\'t exactly paint us --- or you --- in the best of lights. If you have a problem, you know how it should be handled.\"

Travers nodded hastily and muttered an apology before he and his friends left the hall.

The girl was one Harry recognized, if vaguely. Her name was Gemma Fawley and she was the Head Girl this year. She was of average height with light brown hair and sea-green eyes. She had soft facial features that were always very well-modulated and Harry now learned from being under her stare that her eyes had a certain, penetrating quality to them, as if they were seeing more than just his irises.

\"Do be careful, Potter. Travers is no genius, but he\'s far from incompetent. If he\'s anything like the rest of his family, he\'s also impulsive and spiteful. Between the two of us and your friends, that\'s a dangerous combination, especially where you\'re concerned. Come and speak with myself or one of the prefects if he does anything too horribly out of line.\"

Harry nodded curtly as she left, trying not to show exactly how much that comment had bothered him.

As if he needed anything else unpleasant to think about that morning.

***December 13, 1991***

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***10:13 PM***

Harry and his friends returned to the common room after a fairly long Friday night practice. It was still a matter of fact that every Friday night, the boys --- occasionally, but not always accompanied by Pansy --- would practice their spell work. Their female friend usually remained in the common room --- probably to keep up with the ever-churning Hogwarts rumour mill.

This particular night had gone pretty well for all involved except for Harry. He had still easily performed the best --- even if Theodore had done well, as he always did --- but Harry knew he could have performed better.

He was just... distracted.

He had been on and off lately; ever since Travers\'s verbal assault in the Great Hall four days ago. To make matters worse, some of the second and even a few of the third year Slytherins had begun hitting him with minor jinxes in the corridors any time no one was watching. They hadn\'t today, as Draco had practically ordered Crabbe and Goyle to escort Harry everywhere. The two of them may not have been Merlin with a wand, but they damn sure struck an imposing visage. One that many clearly didn\'t want to cross, for it had been by far Harry\'s most peaceful day since the incident in the Great Hall.

Though that certainly was a contributing factor to his stress, it wasn\'t actually the thing that had him most wound up.

He had sat behind Greengrass and Davis in History of Magic and listened to the former lecture the latter on the importance of assigning the proper gift to the proper person, even if it was a small thing.

Harry had become immediately concerned.

He hadn\'t even really considered giving gifts. He had of course been aware of the fast-approaching holiday season, but the impulse to consider gift-giving had never even arisen. Probably because before now, Harry had never been in a position where giving gifts had been plausible. It wasn\'t really something one could do while locked up in a cupboard and living meal to meal.

Even if he had considered it, Greengrass\'s lecture would have worried him.

How on earth was he, a muggle-raised student --- and not an overly social one at that --- supposed to understand how to buy gifts for purebloods who had virtually everything they had ever wanted?

According to Greengrass, one could make a right fool of themself if they chose gifts wrong, which was something Harry was more than a touch concerned about.

Harry and his friends sat around the fire for some time after their return to the common room and Harry couldn\'t help but notice the way Pansy\'s gaze kept finding him every time he looked away for more than a moment.

\"Harry?\"

\"Mhm,\" hummed Harry, looking up from his book on Transfiguration theory and towards Pansy, who had spoken.

\"If I go and get my things for the essay we owe McGonagall next week, can you help me with it?\"

Pansy really was rubbish at Transfiguration compared to the rest of them, with the exceptions of Crabbe and Goyle, but Harry felt that something else was afoot here. Something likely relating to the odd glances she had repeatedly been sparing him since he had re-entered the common room.

\"Sure.\"

Pansy stood and gestured a bit hesitantly for Harry to join her. He wasn\'t sure that he would be able to enter her dorm, but he shrugged and stood anyway, following her out of the common room\'s main sitting area. He had no doubt she really did want help on that essay, but he thought this gesture may be leading to her other purpose. Harry had by now spent enough time around Slytherins to begin understanding how they worked, after all.

\"Are you all right?\" she asked him once they were alone. He had chosen to refrain from questioning her on the course of action she had chosen.

\"I\'m fine, yeah.\"

\"You seem stressed.\"

Pansy might not have had his or Theodore\'s academic prowess, but she was very gifted when it came to reading people; him in particular. This wasn\'t the first time she had made that obvious, but he found himself constantly reminded of the fact.

\"A bit, I guess.\"

\"About what happened with Travers?\"

He hesitated. \"Yeah...\"

\"That doesn\'t sound very confident.\"

\"It\'s... more than one thing.\"

\"Hmm?\"

Harry pierced her with his most intense stare. \"If I tell you, will you promise not to tell Draco and the others?\"

\"Of course.\" The snobbish way with which she answered --- lip curled, posture straight, and nose upturned --- made it seem as though the question itself had been foolish.

\"I... heard Greengrass telling Davis all about how the right gift should be given to the right person and about how you can look like a total prat if you mess it up. I have no idea about any of that and I don\'t even know how to get ahold of presents while we\'re stuck up inside the castle.\"

Harry looked down at the floor, worried Pansy might react in a similarly snobbish manner to how she had answered his previous question. He worried she might look at him with disdain or sigh exasperatedly at his ignorance.

As it turned out, she did none of these things.

\"Oh, Harry, I\'m *so* glad you asked!\" When she actually sounded excited of all things, Harry looked up and found himself surprised by what he saw. A gleam in her eye; one akin to that of a child who had just spotted the most interesting toy on display. \"See? This is why you should tell me these things. You came to the *perfect* person for this.\"

Idly, Harry couldn\'t help but wonder exactly what he had just gotten himself into.

***December 21, 1991***

***The Entrance Hall***

***10:24 AM***

Harry walked with his friends --- both those from his year as well as Diana and her group --- as they made their way down to the entrance hall and readied themselves to board the train which would take them back to London. On their way down, they saw Hagrid hefting what had to be a magically enlarged Christmas tree towards the Great Hall\'s entrance.

The sight of the giant man gave Harry some pause. He had treated him so well in Diagon Alley, but the two of them had barely spoken since. They would exchange the odd greeting if the pair encountered one another in the corridors, but these occasions were scarce. Other than that, they hadn\'t shared any interactions since Harry\'s arrival at the castle. At least none the boy could remember. This all somehow seemed wrong after the way Harry had been introduced to the magical world and he made a mental note to remedy such a thing at his earliest possible convenience.

Harry allowed himself one passing glance inside the Great Hall, where he noticed Professors Flitwick and McGonagall setting up some more elaborate decorations. It was beginning to look like a winter wonderland, with fake snow falling from the enchanted ceiling high above and vibrant decor quickly spreading throughout the massive room.

The sight of his friends leaving the castle minutes later was far less pleasing, and Harry found himself hating the Dursleys perhaps more than he had ever hated them before. It was odd, as they had done things in the past that would generally be viewed as far more atrocious than this. What many people may have failed to take into account was that for the first time in Harry\'s life, they had actually deprived him of something more than just his own, selfish desires.

They had deprived him of friendship, which in a way just spoke of how far Harry had already come whilst away from their oppressive practices.

He tensed at the hand on his shoulder and had to resist the impulse to turn away as he glanced to see Cassius staring at him with an expression of deep understanding.

\"Hey, it\'ll be all right. They\'re only gone for about two weeks. That sounds like a lot, but it\'ll pass quickly enough.\" He grinned. \"Care to make it pass even faster?\" Reluctantly intrigued, Harry tilted his head, asking Cassius a silent question while doing so. \"Well, I think it\'s time for the two of us to actually go out flying. I\'ve been wanting to put you through your paces ever since that first day I saw you out with Draco.\"

Most of the thoughts pertaining to the Dursleys and his friends were wiped immediately away, and Harry couldn\'t help but allow a smile to blossom across his face. \"Sure, you\'re on!\"

***Later that night, at Malfoy Manor...***

The rural areas of Wiltshire were vast. One could go in any direction for what felt like an eternity and find nothing at all. It was full of open fields and dense forests that never seemed to end.

If one did travel far enough in a very specific direction, however --- assuming they weren\'t a muggle impacted by a number of privacy wards --- they would stumble across a truly magnificent sight.

They would first come to a gravel driveway flanked on either side by hedges taller than the average man. If they followed this curved drive, it would take them to the foot of towering, wrought-iron gates that were as dark as obsidian. On this particular night, a pair of pristine-looking peacocks perched atop the gates in a similar fashion to how a number of their fellows did so at near-uniform intervals on the handsome hedges. Behind these loomed a sight with the potential to take one\'s breath away.

Expansive, lush lawns stretched out on all sides and in the distance, well-kept forests could be seen. There was even a lake which, in the daylight, sparkled in the light as if it was but a sheet of glass.

None of that was the main attraction, however.

The main attraction was the expansive manor that dominated the land\'s massive centre, towering above all other things in the area and casting them easily into its shadow. The handsome house was surrounded by breathtaking gardens that would not have been out of place in fabled tales of mythology. Near the house\'s front entrance, a large, modern-looking fountain quietly spouted water, adding to the rich image of tranquility that the entire scene gave off.

The inside of the manor was just as splendid as the outside, if not even more so.

The manor\'s general feel was of wealth and darkness. The floor in Malfoy Manor was done in a dark, rich-looking wood. Soft, pale drapings obscured large glass windows on either side of a somewhat circular staircase that converged in the centre of a balcony on the next floor, which overlooked the entrance hall itself. The pale, cream curtains cast a soft, yet ominous light across the otherwise lowly-lit hall. In the relative darkness, the staircase\'s railings --- which appeared to be made of pure gold --- glinted sinisterly, if such a thing was at all possible for such rich material.

Beneath the staircase, there was a life-sized portrait depicting the current four members of the Malfoy family, noses upturned, heads held high and surrounded by a gilded, ornate frame.

Up this staircase and down a number of corridors was a rich oak door. One that led to the house\'s most secure room; one that not even the house elves could enter without expressed permission.

In the room sat various portraits of former Malfoy lords, as well as a number of them that didn\'t portray people, but significant events in the family\'s history. The largest portrait of all hung behind the dark oak desk which was one of the room\'s distinguishing features. The portrait\'s background was velvety black, with a number of great snakes depicted in emerald green curling in its centre, underneath which words were written in a silvery, serpentine script.

*Sanctimonia Vincet Semper*

Two comfortable, high-backed chairs sat across the desk from the family crest\'s depiction, in front of which sat the family\'s lord. In the two chairs before him were his children, both of whom wondering exactly why they had been called here together. One of them --- the eldest and family\'s heiress --- had only ever been called into this room a handful of times. Her younger brother could only remember one instance; the day before he had been sent to Hogwarts to begin his formal magical education.

\"I trust you left nothing of significance unsaid during the retellings of your first semester at Hogwarts?\" Lucius Malfoy paused. \"Except for the information I asked you not to vocalize prominently in front of your mother?\" Both children nodded and Lucius leant forward, folding his hands in front of him on the desk. \"Good. Now, is there anything... interesting either of you would like to tell me about Mister Potter?\"

***December 25, 1991***

***The Slytherin Dorms***

***7:37 AM***

Harry had greatly enjoyed flying with Cassius the morning his friends had left Hogwarts, and he had learned plenty during their exploits. They had spent most of the past number of days together and Harry could honestly say he was now closer to Cassius than anyone else who wasn\'t named Draco, Pansy, or Diana.

Just before going to bed on the eve of Yule, Cassius had asked Harry to wait for him before opening their presents, which he said would be waiting at the foot of Harry\'s bed the morning of the 25th. Harry still found the thought of presents odd, but he didn\'t say that to Cassius. Had it not been for the fact he knew at least several of his friends had bought him gifts, he would likely have been surprised by the pile that awaited him upon his waking that next morning.

He had to wait quite some time for Cassius, which began to make him impatient. It was the first time in living memory he had ever received gifts and he was eager to tear into them.

In the end, he decided to read while he waited, since he knew Cassius was *not* a morning person. He frequently slept in well past ten on weekends, but Harry had warned him not to do that this morning. If the time ticked past eight, he had said, he would be opening his gifts, whether Cassius liked it or not.

The boy cut it close, sauntering into the room whilst clearly in quite a dazed state at about twenty minutes before the cut-off time. Cassius was levitating his own pile of gifts and the two of them exchanged but a brief greeting before bearing down on their respective hauls.

Harry first opened heaping boxes of sweets from Crabbe and Goyle before going through a number of token gifts from his yearmates and, strangely, the Quidditch team.

The first semi-notable gift came from Pansy, who had sent Harry several boxes packed with all different kinds of clothing, both wizard and muggle. The latter had surprised him, but according to the attached note, Pansy\'s family were majority stakeholders in a notable muggle fashion company. Theodore sent him a book on what seemed like some interestingly questionable curses, and Draco sent him a leather-bound, gold-embroidered, collector\'s edition copy of *Quidditch Through the Ages.* Cassius had gone a similar route, choosing a more strategy-based book on the major sport of the wizarding world.

Harry couldn\'t help but think it odd how many of these gifts linked to Quidditch in some way. It wasn\'t something he had expected, nor was it something he understood.

Hagrid sent him a wooden flute that was obviously hand-carved. It was a relief to Harry, as he had sent Hagrid several boxes of sweets and a letter asking whether or not the man would be amiable to catching up that afternoon. Hagrid\'s affirmative reply was also enclosed, which allowed Harry to at least take comfort in the fact that he hadn\'t ruined his first magical friendship.

The next three gifts were from the other three members of the Malfoy family and they all surprised Harry in different ways.

Narcissa had sent him a book on wizarding genealogy and a note enclosed wishing him well that gently suggested that he look into his family history. Diana had opted to send two books. One was an intermediate tome on magical theory and one discussed the Dark Arts, which made Harry\'s eyes widen comically. From the brief skim of the table of contents, the book didn\'t so much teach them as much as it did explain them.

The one that elicited the largest response from Cassius came from Lucius. It was a heavy watch made of pure gold and there were obviously diamonds in the design. It was just as flamboyant and over the top as one might expect from the Malfoy family. It worked in the same way as the magical clocks Harry had been so interested in on the first day, only to find out they worked the same as the muggle ones; they were just done up in a fancier manner and presented as a groundbreaking discovery.

\"What is it?\" Harry asked Cassius, noticing the way he kept eyeing the watch.

\"It\'s... well, it\'s honestly best if you learn for yourself. Go and look up customs between lords and heirs in one of the etiquette books. It should give you an idea. It\'s not a bad thing,\" he assured his younger friend. \"Just... not what I would have expected.\"

The second to last present confused Harry more than anything. For one thing, he certainly hadn\'t expected Gemma Fawley to send him anything. For another, he had no idea why she would send him a book that --- thanks to his reading *The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts* --- he knew to be discussing Gellert Grindelwald\'s war.

*The Blood War: What Really Happened?*

That was one Harry conceded he would need to think upon later. He still had one more gift left to open and it was really best if he refocused his attention on that for now.

The final present Harry had laid out on his bed was a small one; only a pristine-looking envelope. On its back was a crest; one Harry recognized as belonging to one of the most prominent families in the country. He had seen it while studying his copy of *Nature\'s Nobility: A Guide to Wizarding Genealogy* back in the summer.

The crest depicted a night-time backdrop. Much of it was dominated by what appeared to be a field of roses, stretching from one side of the crest to another. In the centre, the roses contorted around an elegant glass of wine; a symbol for purity, while the constellation Ursa Major shone in the sky above, which was also occupied by a flock of ravens. At the bottom of the crest, in golden letters, were written the words *Toujours Pur.*

The letter read:

*Heir Potter:*

*I hope this letter finds you in the best of health and in good spirits. It is a pleasure to see you back in the wizarding world after all these years.*

*This letter has not been sent for any particular purpose, but more so as a formal letter of introduction, since you are one of the closest relatives I have left --- as depressing a thought as that is.*

*I would like to wish you a very happy holiday, encourage a reply, and formally welcome you back to the wizarding world on behalf of the Founding House of Black.*

*Yours truly,*

*Regulus Arcturus Black*

*Lord of the Founding House of Black*

***Hours later...***

Harry had spent more time in Hagrid\'s hut than he had expected. They had discussed much of Harry\'s first year at Hogwarts in detail, as well as a vast array of other things. Hagrid assured Harry he hadn\'t turned his back on him for something as simple as his sorting, even though he seemed to speak of the other Slytherins very carefully.

They had also discussed Harry\'s parents. Hagrid had heard about his prowess in both Charms and Transfiguration, so he likened him to Lily and James, who had specialized respectively in the two subjects.

By the time Harry had eaten dinner and left the hut, night had fallen and the temperature had done likewise. He was really quite tired, even though it was not yet terribly late. It had been a long day full of firsts and all of the new experiences had wound up being exhausting in their own way. He certainly hadn\'t expected a personal bit of correspondence from Lord Black, though the same could be said for a number of his gifts.

Little did he know, his night was not yet done.

When Harry entered his dormitory some time later, he noticed a new package on his bed; one that had not been there this morning.

He frowned. There was nobody else from his dormitory at Hogwarts and everyone who would have reasonably sent him gifts had already done so. He crept slowly towards it and eyed the packaging carefully. He briefly debated bringing it to Cassius and asking him to check it for curses. He didn\'t think Travers disliked him that much, but he wouldn\'t be shocked. He eventually decided that Travers, only being a second year, probably couldn\'t cast any of those curses. Harry also just had a gut feeling this was something different, so that was what he went with after a long moment of apprehension.

Two things fell from the package: a letter and a flowing, silvery something.

Harry opened the letter first.

*Your father left this in my possession when he died. It is time it was returned to you.*

*Use it well.*

*A very merry Christmas to you.*

Perplexed by the lack of a signature, Harry next picked up the flowing, silvery something; which actually turned out to be a cloak...

A cloak that made his hand vanish when it passed underneath its flowing fabric.

Suddenly, Harry was anything but fatigued.

***December 26, 1991***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***11:47 PM***

After the shock of owning a cloak that made one invisible had marginally worn off the previous night, Harry had used it to explore the castle for some time before he had run into Mrs. Norris. That encounter had raised very interesting questions: did the cloak work on cats or ghosts? He had already been sure it worked on people, but this would be an inherent weakness if it existed.

Thus, Harry had found himself in the library, scouring the shelves for any mention of anything like his cloak.

He had spent most of that night and the next day in the library, and it was where he had returned to after finishing up dinner in the Great Hall on this evening. After searching for several more hours, a possibility started nagging at Harry; one that subconsciously made his eyes dart every so often in the direction of the dark, shadowy portion of the library.

By the time midnight was approaching, he had given in and, with a deep, centring breath, made sure the cloak was fastened tightly around him before stepping into the Restricted Section.

Nothing happened, which was both a great relief as well as very anticlimactic. Once there, Harry searched for about thirty minutes before everything had gone pear-shaped.

He had opened an ancient, leather-bound tome which had omitted the most horrible and ghastly screaming sound imaginable. It was so bad that it made Harry drop the book and reflexively bolt from the room, knowing only that he wanted to get as far away from the Restricted Section as possible.

After running for what felt like ages and thoroughly losing track of where he was, Harry exhaustedly slunk into what he thought was a disused, abandoned classroom to allow himself time to catch his breath.

His assumption about the room was only half-correct.

It was, for all intents and purposes, an abandoned classroom, but it was perhaps not as out of use as Harry might have expected.

Leaning against one of the walls was an ornate-looking mirror that was about two full feet taller than Harry.

Something about it drew him in. Perhaps it was how rich and immaculate it appeared, but he didn\'t think that was it. It gave off an odd feeling that was hard to explain. Harry just... knew he had to look into that mirror.

What he saw confused him greatly.

He didn\'t see the room around him, nor did he even see a reflection.

In the mirror was nothing but vague, shadowy things that he couldn\'t entirely make out. They were so indiscernible that he couldn\'t decide whether they were people, objects, or something different altogether.

Yet he couldn\'t look away.

For reasons Harry Potter couldn\'t quite explain, he just couldn\'t look away.

And he didn\'t... for eight long hours.

***December 28, 1991***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***10:13 PM***

Harry had been so entranced by the odd mirror that he had returned the next night and simply spent hours staring into the shadowy shapes within. That next morning, Cassius had questioned him. He had asked why he had woken up so much later these last two days and why he looked as though he had barely slept.

The answer to both of those questions was simple.

Harry had spent both nights staring into the mirror until the sun had begun to rise, at which point he would hastily retreat to his dormitory, catch a few hours of sleep, and begin his day anew.

He hadn\'t told Cassius this, but the boy was no fool. He knew Harry was doing something and he had advised him not to do it that next night.

But Harry hadn\'t listened, which was how he found himself alone in the mirror room once more. He threw off his cloak and made a hasty beeline for the mirror.

\"So, back again, Harry?\"

He froze halfway there, feeling as though his insides had turned to ice. Apparently, he was not as alone as he had previously believed.

Sitting leisurely atop one of the desks, his hands folded serenely in his lap and a pensive expression upon his old, withered face, was Albus Dumbledore.

\"I... didn\'t see you there, sir.\"

\"Strange how shortsighted being invisible can make you.\"

Harry was relieved the man was smiling. It was actually the only thing that gave him the confidence to ask his next question.

\"Did you... know I would be here?\"

\"I certainly suspected you would be.\"

\"Sir, were you... here for all the time I\'ve spent looking into the mirror?\"

\"Only last night, I\'m afraid. Whether or not that is all the time you have spent in this room, I am unsure.\"

\"But I-I checked the room last night.\"

Dumbledore\'s eyes twinkled in an odd sort of way. \"If you will forgive my lack of modesty for a moment, I do not need a cloak to become invisible.\"

Ah, that would certainly do it.

\"So,\" said Dumbledore, sliding off the desk and walking casually towards both Harry and the mirror. \"You, like many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\"

Harry looked at the mirror once more. Not into it, but actually *at* it. Doing so was something he hadn\'t done since that first night and only now did he see the writing written upon it. At first glance, it appeared to be written in a foreign language. Upon closer inspection, he realized it was just English. Jumbled English, but English nonetheless.

*Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.*

\"I... guess so.\"

\"I expect that by now, you have deduced what it is the mirror shows you?\"

\"I... not exactly, sir.\"

Dumbledore studied him very closely. \"If it is not too presumptuous of me to ask, what is it that you see when you look into the Mirror of Erised?\"

Harry considered whether or not to answer. If the greatest wizard alive was asking the question, the answer was probably significant. Everything he had learned over the past few months while in Slytherin screamed that he shouldn\'t answer, but his natural curiosity said otherwise. Harry wanted to understand what it was about the mirror that was so compelling, and this seemed like his best chance to do just that.

\"I... don\'t see much of anything.\" When Dumbledore just waited patiently for Harry to elaborate, he acquiesced. \"I see a bunch of shadows. I can\'t even tell if they\'re people, things, or something else. They\'re just... there.\"

There was a long moment of silence during which Dumbledore stroked his beard, suddenly looking as though the lateness of the hour had caught up with him all at once.

\"Curious,\" he muttered, reminding Harry painfully of Mr. Olivander back in Diagon Alley. \"How very curious.\"

With an intense feeling of déjà vu, Harry decided to take the bait. \"What\'s curious, sir?\"

\"In all the time I have spent studying the Mirror of Erised --- and between the two of us, that has been occupying much of my time of late --- I have never once heard of the mirror showing anyone something similar to what you seem to be experiencing.\"

\"So... what is it that it\'s supposed to show you?\"

Dumbledore thought for a moment. \"Let me explain. If the happiest man on Earth looked into the mirror, he would be able to use it just as any other man would use an ordinary mirror. That is to say, he would see himself exactly as he is.\"

Harry thought about that, running a hand absentmindedly through his hair. \"It... shows you what you most want to see?\" That somehow didn\'t sound quite right, but it made some sense until Harry thought of it on a personal level. He knew of all the things he wanted to see, shadows weren\'t extraordinarily high on that list.

\"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore heavily. \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.\"

\"Isn\'t that the same thing, sir? And... how does that explain what I see?\"

\"Both excellent questions. I believe the former can actually be best explained by answering the latter. How it explains what you see, Harry, is best articulated by asking you to think upon the differences between your mind and your heart.

\"Your mind often thinks it knows what it wants above all things, but it is so rarely correct. I am sure you --- in your youthful naivety and exuberance --- think you desire a great many things. Alas, your heart knows best. It knows that when everything is boiled down, there is no one thing you have decided matters more than anything else. In the simplest possible terms, your mind is the manifestation of your consciousness, whilst your heart is often a reflection of all that is subconscious.\"

Harry nodded along slowly. The bit about him somehow sounded dark and depressing, but he couldn\'t dispute its accuracy. When he really thought about it, there wasn\'t one thing he wanted above all else.

\"This mirror will give us neither knowledge nor truth, Harry. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. The mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, and I ask you not to go looking for it. If you ever do come across it again, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live. Remember that. Now, how about you put on that admirable cloak of yours once more and get off to bed.\"

Harry got about halfway to his cloak when an odd question struck him. \"Professor Dumbledore... can I ask you something?\"

Dumbledore smiled once more. \"Obviously, you have just done so, but you may ask me one more thing.\"

\"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\"

There was a beat of silence before Dumbledore answered in a very measured and modulated tone. \"I see myself, many years ago, mending a great many things that I so wish were repairable.\" His serious demeanour washed away all at once. \"Now, I think it\'s time for bed.\"

Harry nodded and left the room, thinking on a great many things as he did so, once more back under his new invisibility cloak.

***December 29, 1991***

***A Tower Overlooking a Lake***

***8:14 AM***

On this fateful morning, the water was turbulent and churning, rising from its prison and slamming hard against the rock faces of any nearby mass of land. The sky was grey and overcast and the light breeze tore across the water\'s surface, seeming to laugh softly at the water\'s futile struggle to break free from its confines.

Surrounded by a great many mountain peaks sat a high, imposing tower. One that was much too tall and much too protected to ever be taken down by a storm, no matter how intense it might be.

From the top-most window of this imposing fortress, one would be able to see the sky and the lake just fine.

But the figure inside the tower\'s highest room saw none of this.

His emaciated body broke free from its fit of twitching and shot up to a sitting position with exuberance one might expect from a man nearly a century his junior. He was skeletally thin and his wrinkled, leathery skin was pulled tight across his perpetually aching bones.

Well, perhaps not perpetually because for the first time in years, the figure felt no ache.

Nor did he feel old, nor bored --- two sensations which had dominated his psyche for many years.

The man may not have seen the world outside through his then closed eyelids, but what he did see, to him, was far more beautiful than any bit of scenery that had ever existed.

The man\'s bluish-silver eyes --- which still shone with just as much intellect as ever --- were dancing with a malicious light not seen within them for decades as the one-time dark lord uttered, in reference to all he had just seen, the first word he had spoken in an age.

\"Hervorragend.\"

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***7:07 PM***

The rest of Harry\'s winter break had passed much more routinely after his conversation with Dumbledore standing before the Mirror of Erised. True to his word, he hadn\'t gone looking for the entrancing artifact again, though a small part of him did wonder where the mirror was now. For that matter, a small part of him wondered why the mirror had been at Hogwarts in the first place. It seemed like an odd thing to just be lying around a school, but perhaps there was something Harry was missing.

He and Cassius had wanted to go flying again, but the late December and early January weather of the Scottish highlands had other ideas. There hadn\'t been much snow falling in the past week or so, but the air had been frigid and the strong winds had been as bitingly cold as they had been persistent. The two of them had tried once and ended up retreating back into the castle within minutes. Cassius had shown Harry the Warming Charm, but it was simply no match for the brutality wrought upon them by the vengeful forces of nature.

Harry spent much of his time waiting for his friends\' return either in the library, keeping himself entertained with Cassius, or exploring the castle. He had gotten a lot of the latter done lately, largely aided by his invisibility cloak. He still hadn\'t told Cassius about it, nor did he plan to. He had considered it but decided against the idea. Whether he would tell Draco, Pansy, Theodore, Crabbe, and Goyle... that was more complicated.

He hadn\'t quite decided by the time they poured back into the common room alongside the rest of the returning Slytherin students.

\"Harry!\" Pansy squealed upon entering the room, rushing over and chattering at him at a million miles an hour. Harry\'s eyes nearly glazed over trying to keep up, but Draco saved him a minute or so later.

\"Let him breathe, Pansy. Merlin only knows how strange it must feel going from speaking with only Cassius to speaking with you.\"

\"And what exactly is that supposed to mean?\"

\"Just that Cassius is calm and quiet. You\'re a lot of things, but those are not two of them.\"

Pansy shoved Draco hard in the chest. \"Prat.\" She turned back towards Harry. \"How was your holiday?\"

\"It was good. A bit slow, but not in a bad way.\"

\"Any interesting gifts?\"

This was the moment his mind had been contemplating over for so long.

He had of course gotten a number of interesting things. Some of the books --- the more questionable ones, in particular --- had been unexpected. There had been the formal letter of introduction sent by Lord Black --- one Harry had very carefully responded to that next day --- as well as the golden watch from Lucius. He had taken Cassius\'s advice and looked into that. The only thing he could find in his book of etiquette was that watches were a traditional wizarding gift. Some lords passed them down to their heir upon their arrival at Hogwarts, while unrelated parties often distributed them for a wizard\'s seventeenth birthday. Since neither of those things seemed right, Harry was reasonably sure he was missing something.

And then, of course, there was the invisibility cloak.

Harry liked Cassius, but he didn\'t trust him nearly as much as this group of friends.

Even in saying that, he wasn\'t quite sure he trusted them enough to let them in on that little secret. The cloak was his trump card. It was his most treasured artifact and by far the most mystical thing he had thus far seen in this wonderful world of magic.

He wasn\'t quite sure he trusted *anybody* enough.

Then again, maybe they could help him put together the puzzle that had been troubling him for some time.

He had eventually found a book in the library that spoke a bit on invisibility cloaks. They were extremely rare things, so the information on them was very scarce. The most known thing about them was that they were often largely composed of demiguise hair.

That wasn\'t what had interested Harry the most.

The thing that piqued his interest above all others was the passage about how invisibility cloaks rarely lasted for longer than a few years.

That did not add up.

If whoever had sent the cloak was to be believed, then it had been his father\'s. He wasn\'t sure for how long before his death the man had owned it, but that meant it was more than ten years old. According to the admittedly limited amount of information at Harry\'s disposal, that should have been impossible.

Yet here it was.

Part of him wanted to ask Draco, Theodore, Pansy, or perhaps even Diana about this oddity.

But a larger part of him thought it was safer to keep at least one secret close to his chest.

He trusted these people --- trusted them more than anyone he had ever met in all of his life --- but he didn\'t trust them unconditionally.

The way he had been raised didn\'t lend itself well towards unconditional trust.

It wasn\'t that he didn\'t believe what they were telling him or that he thought they were lying. He trusted them in that regard.

What Harry worried about above all other things was that eventually, they would abandon him or turn their back on him. Just like his supposed family had done in the muggle world. Just like every friend he had made at school quickly did once Dudley had imposed his will upon them.

Harry couldn\'t shake the feeling that one day, he would be left alone once more.

From that paranoia stemmed a certain instinct to preserve oneself.

It was this instinct which led to Harry deciding not to tell his friends about the invisibility cloak.

***January 10, 1992***

***The Dungeons***

***9:34 PM***

Whilst at home over the holiday break, Theodore had apparently taken an interest in duelling. That led to Harry, Theodore, Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle mock duelling that first Friday night back at Hogwarts.

Draco had easily trounced Crabbe and Goyle. Not that such a thing was an accomplishment worth writing home about. Harry liked both of them; they were quiet but loyal and not quite as dim as everyone thought. Like them or not though, Harry could admit that saying Draco had trounced the pair was like saying your favourite Quidditch team had beaten the Chudley Cannons. It had probably happened, but it really didn\'t mean anything in the grand scheme of things.

Draco and Theodore\'s duels had been relatively competitive, but Theodore had the clear edge and Draco hadn\'t managed to beat him even once. Harry and Theodore had by far the most interesting rounds of duelling, but it was really a similar situation to when Theodore had duelled Draco, just in reverse. Whilst he didn\'t get embarrassed, Theodore never managed to win. He actually knew a number of spells Harry didn\'t, but Harry was just miles better at the spells he did know and Theodore\'s Aegis Vocar shield didn\'t hold up against spells like the Full-Body-Bind.

Harry felt exuberant after the duels. They had pumped life through his veins like blood, a feeling he had never experienced in this way before. Flying brought on a somewhat similar sensation, but it was nothing like this. This was something completely of its own nature and it was something Harry greatly enjoyed.

Though as they re-entered the common room to join back up with Pansy, Harry couldn\'t help but notice how Theodore seemed uncharacteristically quiet.

***February 2, 1992***

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***8:30 PM***

The night before February\'s first week of classes were to begin, all of the Slytherin first years were gathered around the fire in the centre of the common room. They had all been summoned by the prefects, all six of whom were sitting alongside them. Harry could see that Gemma Fawley --- the Head Girl and seventh-year prefect --- seemed to be the ringleader.

\"That\'s all of you?\" asked Marcus Flint, a sixth-year prefect and the captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team.

All of the first years nodded and the prefects all looked towards Gemma, who spoke next.

\"Exams take place every June at Hogwarts, as you all know. Academic performances play a large part in winning the House Cup, and those exams will make up the bulk of at least your practical marks in each subject.\" She looked intently at each of them in turn. \"Slytherin has won the House Cup for the past six years. It\'s not a trend we want to break, least of all me whilst I\'m Head Girl.

\"We know that as first years, taking exams can be stressful and a bit overwhelming. It\'s not something you will have done before, so we want to make sure you all succeed to the best of your abilities. That\'s why you\'re here. We\'ve gotten all of your grades from Professor Snape and looked them over. The idea is that each of you will have a student between fifth and seventh year to help tutor you and guide you through the process. Almost all of you will be tutored by sixth years, since fifth and seventh years have major exams of their own to worry about. There are a few exceptions though.

\"Obviously, you won\'t all be paired with a prefect, since there\'s more of you than there is us, but we\'ve gone through your grades and decided who to pair each of you with. You will meet with your partner at least once a week. It will be on a fixed day that the two of you can discuss. If you think you need more help, ask. More meetings can be arranged, but you\'re expected to meet at least once per week. Now, the pairings.\"

Draco was paired with Marcus Flint, which the younger boy was immensely smug about. Flint had quite the reputation among the younger years and even plenty of upper years. He was a demon of a chaser and a brutal captain. He wasn\'t an academic genius, but Harry had heard he did well at the practical side of magic. Defence Against the Dark Arts was his preferred area of study, but beyond all else, the hulking boy just had an intimidating aura about him.

Not that Draco cared all that much about that.

Harry knew all too well Draco was thrilled to be paired with Flint because, at least in his friend\'s mind, this was Draco\'s in with the Quidditch team next year.

Harry was the last of his friends to be paired up, and he couldn\'t help but be surprised by the identity of his partner.

\"Lastly,\" said Fawley, \"Potter, you\'re with me.\"

Harry had not expected that.

He had assumed she would use her authority as Head Girl to get out of the assignment. Especially with her N.E.W.T.s on the horizon. That seemed by far the more Slytherin thing to do and Harry couldn\'t see any valid reason why she hadn\'t done it.

Not that he was complaining.

She would probably be a great help, not just in preparing for the exams, but hopefully in learning some extra-curricular material. He wondered whether she would be averse to answering questions not directly related to the exams. He had put a considerable amount of work into magical theory since his lecture from Flitwick, and having somebody on standby at least once a week to answer his questions and help further his musings would be invaluable.

He supposed he would just need to wait and see how it all played out.

***February 14, 1992***

***The Dungeons***

***6:36 PM***

Harry and the others had awoken the morning of Valentine\'s Day to a completely different atmosphere than they were accustomed to. Many of the older students seemed quite touchy with one another. Harry personally had not needed to see several older boys chasing kisses with their girlfriends in the common room that morning. It made him more uncomfortable than it perhaps should have, but at least all the others in his group --- sans Pansy --- seemed to agree with him.

It didn\'t stop there, either.

There were two suits of armour standing guard outside the Great Hall that morning, both of them colourfully themed for the holiday. Their armour had been turned a lurid pink and they were armed with bows and arrows as opposed to swords and shields. The walls inside the Great Hall seemed also to temporarily have been painted red.

\"No great mystery who\'s done all this,\" Theodore muttered, glaring in the direction of the staff table.

In his throne-like chair sat Dumbledore, wearing robes of a vibrant pink that would put the armour outside the hall to shame. The old man\'s eyes were twinkling like mad and he also wore a smug smile that practically screamed of how proud of himself he really was.

\"Old codger\'s losing it a little bit more every day,\" murmured Draco, glaring up towards the Hogwarts Headmaster as though he had done him a great personal disservice.

None of that was the most awkward part of the morning.

The most awkward part of the morning had been when dozens of owls had flown into the hall and down towards the Slytherin table, depositing a mountain of post in front of Harry.

This hadn\'t been the first time a similar event had taken place.

He had been informed by Professor Snape that he had been the target of copious amounts of post on Samhain. The professors had anticipated this and decided to subvert Harry\'s post that day since they had thought it might have been a touch tasteless. Snape had told him the post was his to collect at any time, but Harry had never been inclined to do so. The last thing he needed was a bunch of people he had never met telling him how sorry they were about his parents just because he was famous. Most of them probably had never even met his mother or his father and they were likely just writing in hopes of getting a response from the wizarding world\'s magical celebrity.

He had gotten some mail on Yule as well, but it hadn\'t been a terribly large pile. He had wondered if the teachers had chosen to have the bulk of it subverted as well.

If they had, they had clearly forgotten that Valentine\'s Day existed. Or, perhaps, they just hadn\'t considered how it might affect the most famous student to ever go through Hogwarts.

To his ever-lasting embarrassment and his friends\' sadistic pleasure, it seemed as though every girl under the age of ten --- and some much older --- in the country had sent Harry well wishes. Some of them were more... personal than others. By the end of the meal, he was flushing so red he would have put Ron Weasley\'s hair to shame and he was all too eager to get out of the hall when their classes necessitated it.

The group of first-year Slytherins were presently walking back up to the Great Hall, this time for dinner, and Harry was receiving no small ribbing for the morning\'s events.

\"I can\'t believe that girl from Liverpool sent you her---\"

\"Don\'t!\" moaned Harry, burying his head in his hands as his friends laughed uproariously.

Until the fire spell sailed towards them.

Harry, head still in hands, felt a great force he would later learn to be Goyle shove him out of the way. The boy howled in pain right after. He had been struck full in the face by a spell that made his skin break out in horrible boils and his cries of protestation could be heard throughout the dungeons.

Harry felt numb. He was no stranger to having minor jinxes fired at him. Some of the brasher Gryffindors had been doing it for some time and some of the harsher blood supremacists within Slytherin had taken their own potshots on occasion.

This time was different.

This was a legitimate curse fired off in the hall with no regard for those around him.

Harry reacted instinctively.

Years of being bullied by Dudley and his brutish gang had trained a respectably fast reaction time into Harry and on this occasion, he was quick on the draw.

Still stumbling from Goyle shoving him out of the way, Harry threw himself to the floor, rolled, and got back to his feet, wand now in hand.

He recognized their assailants right away and though he was nervous, he knew it could have been much worse.

It was Travers and three of his friends, all of whom were second years.

Harry and Travers struck at the same time, just as Draco and Theodore engaged two of his friends and Crabbe charged forward towards the other.

Travers\'s spell missed, but Harry\'s didn\'t. Travers did manage a hasty Aegis Vocar, but the Full-Body-Bind fired from the end of Harry\'s wand tore straight through it and Travers fell face-first onto the hard stone floor of the dungeons.

Theodore had managed to best his opponent as well. Draco\'s duel was ongoing and Crabbe had somehow ended up on top of the boy he had charged, now pummeling him with furious blows that had the boy curling in on himself. Harry and Theodore both took aim at Draco\'s opponent and the boy fell quickly.

\"What, exactly, has happened here?\"

Harry felt his blood run cold at the sound of Snape\'s cool voice. The professor had never liked him. If he had seen him curse Travers...

\"We were attacked, sir!\" Harry was actually taken aback by how convincing Pansy sounded. She hadn\'t duelled at all, but she sounded for all the world as if her mother had just been murdered in cold blood. \"They just started firing spells. I-I panicked, but Harry, Draco, and the others didn\'t.\"

\"Is this true?\" Snape asked one of the fallen boys, whose face was covered by his now overgrown hair and whose legs were stuck together.

The boy could do nothing more than nod with great trepidation.

\"Off with you,\" Snape told Harry and his friends. \"I will... deal with this from here.\"

None of them protested. It was the first time any in their group had truly seen their Head of House angered and it was not a sight they cared to see again.

Harry, in particular, would have been far more shaken had his mind not been firmly fixated on what had just happened.

The bad news was that now, he might have just made himself some enemies. The good news was that he had not only been able to best a second year, but he had put the prat that was Damian Travers in his place.

Whether the shocking amount of savage pleasure he felt at such a thing was worth it or not, only time would tell.

***February 22, 1992***

***The Grounds of Hogwarts***

***10:13 AM***

Ron was practically glowing by the time his teammates finally allowed him some breathing room.

They had played a match against Hufflepuff that morning and Ron had managed to outfly their seeker and steal the snitch. It hadn\'t been a quick catch, nor had it been easy, but he had done it. There had been no drama with his sleeve this time; it had just been a straightforward race to the snitch, with Ron outmanoeuvring his counterpart and snatching it, signalling an end to the game and setting Gryffindor up as the favourites to win the Quidditch Cup for the first time in over five years.

His teammates had mobbed him and even in the dressing room after the initial, on-pitch festivities, there had been a considerable amount of celebrating. Ron knew too from the aftermath of the last match that there would be a long-running party in the common room that night.

He was actually looking forward to it, but his attention was currently in other places.

One specific place, actually.

That place was the forbidden forest, which he now glided through on his broom, doing his best to follow the hooded figure making its way deeper and deeper into the forest\'s depths.

Ron knew the hooded figure to be Snape, for he had seen him making off towards the vast expanse of forestry before he had pulled his hood up to obscure his sallow face and long, black hair.

He had not yet pulled up his hood when Ron saw him begin making his way towards the forest.

Ron may not have had adequate justification for following, but he was a curious, eleven-year-old boy who despised the bat and considered him to be a greasy old wankstain. He had also seen his mangled leg days after the incident on Halloween, so seeing him sneak off into the forest was sounding alarm bells in his mind.

So he had followed him, gliding stealthily through the canopy on the Nimbus 2000 the school had purchased for him all those months ago. He was presently sitting on a high-up tree branch, veiled mostly by leaves.

He wasn\'t entirely sure what he had expected to see, but the situation\'s reality certainly was not what he had been prepared for.

Snape walked out into a clearing into which a certain degree of light was allowed to stream via the canopy of leaves high above being thinner than the path that had led there. Snape had been in said clearing for but a second before another figure shimmered into existence, causing Ron to gasp. Neither man seemed to hear him, so he refocused, now even more determined to stay out of sight and not make a sound

\"Ah, yes, Severus. Thank you for meeting me in such short order. I know the notice given was less than ideal.\" Snape just nodded curtly at Dumbledore. \"I trust you have continued to keep tabs on our mutual interest?\"

\"Naturally.\"

\"Have any of your findings been of import?\"

\"Your suspicions about the cerberus were correct. It is the primary obstacle in his way and it is a puzzle piece he has not yet solved.\"

\"Very good. Let us hope that mystery continues to baffle him for some time.\"

\"You think it only a matter of time until a solution is found?\"

\"I do.\"

\"May I ask why? He is competent, but I would not have pegged him as such a threat.\"

\"Oh, I am far from certain. I suspect a great deal, but in truth, I know very little.\" Ron could see even from his vantage point that Dumbledore smiled after saying that. \"Well, I suppose I do know a great many things, but none of them directly correlate here, I\'m afraid.\"

\"Shame,\" Snape said dryly, lip curled up in distaste.

\"Indeed. Do you have anything else for me?\" Snape shook his head curtly. \"Very well. While we are here, is there anything of note regarding our... other interest?\"

\"You mean Potter?\"

\"Indeed.\"

\"Not of interest to you. Not much has changed, though the opinions of some in the house towards him are souring.\"

Dumbledore hummed as Ron\'s brain began to work at top speed, trying to figure out what all of this meant. \"Do keep me abreast of such things. I think his Slytherin sorting will be quite the interesting tale to watch unfold.\" Snape nodded jerkily. \"Well, we will meet again in one month\'s time and see if anything of significance has changed. I do thank you for your assistance, Severus. It has been and continues to be invaluable.\"

Dumbledore vanished into thin air, leaving a pensive-looking Snape and a very confused Ron behind him.

Ron had gleaned little of the meeting\'s true intent, but he did know one thing.

Somebody was after whatever lay hidden under that trapdoor protected by the massive, three-headed dog. Somebody who was trying to get past it.

Perhaps it was time to set Hermione down the path of cerberus research. It seemed like a project she would be thoroughly interested in.

\'Well,\' Ron thought with an exasperated half-smile, quietly sliding back onto his broomstick as he made to depart the clearing. \'There aren\'t many projects that girl wouldn\'t be interested in.\'

***March 20, 1992***

***The Dungeons***

***9:08 PM***

Harry had firmly settled into his Hogwarts routine by this point of the school year. He would wake up in the mornings and explore the castle until breakfast, at which point he would join his friends in the Great Hall. Classes would come next --- unless, of course, it was a weekend --- which would take up most of the day. When both classes and dinner had concluded, Harry would usually spend the nights studying, either in the library or by the fire. He was often in the company of his friends, but he frequently paid only half attention to the conversation.

He had taken to using the fast-approaching exams as an excuse to bury his face in books. Really, the truth of the matter was that since diving much further into magical theory, he had just become far more interested in learning it. He was fairly sure at least Theodore and Pansy saw through this farce, but neither of them had thus far called him out on it.

The only nights of the week during which his plan slightly altered were Thursdays and Fridays. Thursdays were spent at a table warded for privacy in the library with Gemma. It had been the day of the week that worked best for her and Harry had been agreeable to just about any time. She did help him study the theoretical portions of some of the courses, but it wasn\'t what made Harry look forward to those sessions.

He had taken by now to reading second-year material in Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, and Charms. He hadn\'t run into any significant setbacks yet, but it was still nice having Gemma to help him with the material. She was surprisingly willing and it was really quite helpful. His professors were busy helping his own yearmates with their actual coursework for Harry to realistically ask them second-year questions. He could have asked Snape, since the man was his Head of House, but the Potions Master still usually pretended Harry didn\'t exist. That was preferable to outright hostility, even if Harry was still more than a little bit bitter. He didn\'t want to risk having a man with so much power over him become openly antagonistic, so he had held his tongue.

Tonight had been another one of his meetings with Gemma and he was feeling pretty good about the whole thing.

\"Oi, Potter!\"

Until an older-sounding voice called out to him and he froze, turning to face the source of the sound.

The boy was tall and lean --- obviously an upper year --- and he looked vaguely familiar. Harry couldn\'t quite place why, for he was sure he had never actually met this boy before.

\"Yes?\"

\"I heard you gave my brother some trouble a while back.\"

Harry\'s face scrunched up as he tried to think what the boy could be talking about. Then, it clicked. The reason this boy looked familiar was because, in many ways, he greatly resembled an older-looking version of Damian Travers; the boy who had antagonized Harry back in December and then jumped him and his friends on the way to the dungeons back in February.

\"He started it,\" argued Harry. \"He fired the first spell. I just defended myself. Besides,\" he continued when he saw that the boy and his two friends whom Harry didn\'t recognize were not looking at all appeased. \"That was like... two months ago now.\"

\"And I would have dealt with it back then had he not waited to tell me. I could tell something was bothering him and it took me ages to get it out of him.\" The boy stepped closer to Harry in a menacing sort of manner. \"I don\'t appreciate people hurting my family, Potter. I\'ve left you alone so far --- even though I think your sorting is disgraceful. Don\'t test my patience.\"

Harry logically knew that he should be terrified, but he wasn\'t.

Instead, he was furious.

He was being blamed for something he hadn\'t done. It really had been Travers who had both started and escalated the whole thing. Harry had just been on the defensive, and now he was being accused of something that hadn\'t been his fault.

There were very few things that annoyed him more than that.

Years of having that unfortunate thing repeatedly happen while under the Dursleys\' rule had grated on Harry. Every time it happened now, it was like a torrent of fire would rise up in his chest, sticking out a fiery tongue and licking at his innards like a snake trying to find a well-hidden exit.

His hands clenched into fists as he tried very hard to resist the urge to go for his wand. He knew he would be hopelessly outmatched by any of these three boys, let alone the trio working together.

But the feeling was just so intense and he found the urge so powerful.

One of the nearby torch brackets exploded, spewing flames straight towards the elder Travers, whose eyes widened as he dove to the side. Harry just stood there wide-eyed, transfixed, and confused by the event that had just occurred.

Had he made that happen?

A wall of force slammed into his chest before he could come to a logical conclusion and he suddenly felt weightless as he soared backwards, slamming hard into the stone floor a moment later. The three boys were marching towards him now. Judging by the looks of hatred and fury on their faces, they at least clearly thought he had somehow caused whatever had just happened.

He tried to get up, but couldn\'t. It wasn\'t that he was in pain so much as that his body just wouldn\'t respond. He couldn\'t properly breathe and without the necessary oxygen, his brain just didn\'t seem to be sending and receiving signals the same way. It was like a satellite responsible for providing muggles with television, but one that was covered in debris of some kind. It still technically worked, but it was choppy and operating at a lower rate of success than usual.

Harry recognized this feeling. He had experienced it enough in his youth, usually during rounds of \'Harry hunting\' that hadn\'t ended favourably for him.

The wind had been forcefully knocked out of him.

\"Protego!\"

A translucent barrier of magic shimmered into being between Harry and his older assailants before they could accost him any further.

\"Travers, what the hell do you think you\'re doing?\"

Harry recognized the voice now. He had heard it not ten minutes ago --- it was Gemma Fawley.

\"This doesn\'t concern you, Fawley.\" snapped back Travers.

\"I\'m the Head Girl and you and your group of thugs are attacking a defenceless first year. I think this is the exact sort of thing that concerns me.\"

\"Defenceless,\" said one of the other boys. \"He made one of the torches explode and spray us with fire and he didn\'t even have his wand!\"

\"Don\'t be ridiculous, Rowle,\" said Fawley. \"Wandless magic of that sort isn\'t possible for any first year. I don\'t know what happened, but that wasn\'t it. Now, move along or this will be taken to Snape.\"

Grumbling and cursing all the way, Travers and his group of thugs, as Gemma had called them, made their reluctant retreat.

\"Are you all right?\" the girl asked, offering her hand and helping the rather small first year to his feet without much trouble.

\"Fine,\" muttered Harry, casting a contemptuous glare in the direction the three older boys had made off in. \"I wasn\'t paying attention. I was surprised by the whole torch thing and then I just got blasted in the chest by something and was flying backwards.\" Harry frowned. \"What was that spell? It seemed really useful.\"

\"Probably either a Banishing Hex or a Knockback Jinx,\" said Gemma. \"The former is a fourth-year spell, so I doubt you would be capable of it just yet.\"

\"What about the other?\"

\"Mid-to-late second year depending on the professor.\"

\"Can you teach me?\"

Her lips twitched. \"Not tonight, but yes; I think teaching it to you should be easy enough. I\'m actually interested in seeing you cast magic instead of just talking about it.\"

\"Next Thursday?\"

She smiled. \"Next Thursday.\"

Despite all that had just happened, Harry smiled back, the anger and worry over the night\'s events temporarily wiped away, if only for a second.

They would be contemplated on in short order, but for now, he simply looked forward to learning a new trick.

***April 12, 1992***

***The Library***

***3:44 PM***

\"Well?\" asked Ron once Hermione had returned from scouring the section of the room they\'d seen Hagrid looking through just a minute or so earlier. \"What was he looking at?\"

So far, Hermione had been completely unsuccessful at finding any bits of information relating to a cerberus, but this was one thing she did not fail at.

She held up several books, all of them pertaining to a single topic.

Ron\'s brain blanked.

No\...

But Hagrid had been acting so suspicious and all of these books...

Surely not...

Surely not even Hagrid would be so daft as to raise a dragon in a wooden hut, for Merlin\'s sake!

**Author\'s Endnote:**

**The pace has picked up dramatically and we are nearing the end. Four more chapters left to go.**

**This will be a much longer AN than usual because I do want to respond to what has really been the only bit of criticism I\'ve gotten so far.**

**Largely, it seems to boil down to the fact that people just have an inherent dislike of Ron and therefore are not fond of him being painted in a favourable light. I make no apologies for how I will be writing Ron. I don\'t believe in needless bashing of characters as I think it is mindless, counterintuitive, and usually not at all reflective of human psychology.**

**However, I will address the concern that Ron is just canon Harry. I can see where that would be an assumption right now, but give it some time. Harry in *The Philosopher\'s Stone*** **was really just a cookie-cutter Gryffindor, so it isn\'t super hard to see how Ron ends up on a similar path here, since not much has canonically changed thus far. I have tried to vary it as much as I can --- by example, he has not navigated Quidditch with the same ease as Harry. Despite Ron coming from a wizarding background, he is canonically not as good at playing quidditch. Nor is he in this fic. This is why we see him making a much less graceful catch of the remembrall, plus a longer match with Hufflepuff in this chapter. This hasn\'t come up, but the only reason Ron has not panicked in Quidditch matches is because when you\'re eleven, you are much less prone to overthinking things as opposed to someone who is fifteen.**

**The last two chapters of this year make much more significant changes to canon that will begin sending Ron down his own path. Trust me, his flaws are still very much there; they just aren\'t the sorts of things that naturally manifest at the age of eleven.**

**I hope this has dissuaded some of the concern regarding his character. If you just want me to bash Ron because you dislike him, this just isn\'t the fic for you, which is fine.**

**For the record, I can\'t wait for the bang that ends this year off...**

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***4:46 PM***

It was the Friday before classes would resume after the Easter holiday break and Harry, along with most of his friends, was sitting around a table in the Slytherin common room. Theodore was playing chess against Pansy, whilst Crabbe and Goyle munched on some sweets and Harry read his book on intermediate magical theory.

Draco was out doing... something. Harry wasn\'t exactly sure what; his friend had been odd as of late.

He seemed to have developed a sort of fixation with Ron Weasley. Ever since Gryffindor\'s Quidditch win all the way back in February, Draco\'s disdain of the boy seemed to have reignited anew. His taunts had grown more frequent and he spoke more and more about Weasley in the company of his friends. The vitriol didn\'t quite match that which Draco had spouted after the first game between Gryffindor and Slytherin, but it was by far the worst Harry had heard since that match had taken place.

Harry had quietly cut in once when Draco\'s incessant criticism of Weasley\'s character had just become too much to bear.

It wasn\'t that Harry had any attachment to Weasley. He didn\'t know the boy, nor did he care about him one way or the other. He hadn\'t been among the bitter contingent of Gryffindors who had been subtly jinxing him in the hallway, but he hadn\'t stopped them either. Harry had seen him shooting a glare or two in the days immediately following the sorting, but they really hadn\'t interacted much beyond that.

He understood the concept of a blood traitor and he didn\'t completely disagree with the stance. The magical world was infinitely superior to the muggle one in every way Harry could conceive. It made no sense to him why anyone would choose to associate with the mundane world, but he didn\'t quite see why purebloods got all up in arms about it. Perhaps they thought these blood traitors were implicitly saying the muggle world was superior. Harry hadn\'t really interpreted it that way. The disregarding of customs was a tad disrespectful in his opinion, but it wasn\'t really something he thought worth holding centuries of prejudice over.

None of that really mattered to Harry. While he thought Hogwarts celebrating Halloween and Christmas instead of Samhain and Yule was a touch disrespectful, he couldn\'t really blame the Weasleys or other families for not following traditions to the letter.

He didn\'t care about Ron Weasley in the slightest. It was just that he didn\'t care at all about Draco\'s hatred for the boy.

The youngest member of the Malfoy family had been surprisingly quiet about his distaste of Weasley ever since, at least in the presence of Harry. His hateful streak hadn\'t stopped though. Recently, he had even cursed Neville Longbottom in the hallway. Though Harry knew Draco disliked Neville due to their families\' disagreements, he thought it had as much to do with Longbottom\'s association with Draco\'s red-headed rival. Draco had even been saying that Weasley was \'up to something.\' He didn\'t know what that \'something\' was, but he was insistent that he was going to find out and somehow use it against Weasley.

None of his friends had taken him seriously until that night, but that all changed when a frantic and breathless Draco Malfoy exploded into the common room, rushing over to his friends with a demented-looking smile.

\"What\'s got you so excited?\" asked Theodore, looking up from the chess game and unmistakably stalling for time to think.

Draco then immediately wiped all notions of chess from their minds. \"That oaf Hagrid is raising a dragon in his hut!\"

Harry felt a painful jolt in his stomach. \"A... dragon?\" he asked. Draco nodded eagerly. \"There aren\'t dragons in Britain, are there?\"

\"Not many,\" said Pansy, \"but they do exist. You wouldn\'t have heard about them in the muggle world. When muggles come across them... well, they usually don\'t live to tell the story.\"

\"And even if they did,\" said Theodore, \"they would be obliviated.\" Harry looked puzzled, so the boy elaborated. \"Obliviated is another word for taking away someone\'s memories of something. There\'s an entire squadron in the ministry that takes care of that. Usually, it has to do with making sure the muggles don\'t find out about us.\"

To Harry, that sounded like the most dangerous spell in the world. He knew exactly the damage not clearly remembering something could cause. His failure to remember exactly how his parents had died had been what forced him to live in ignorance for ten long years. Had it not been for Hagrid\'s intervention, he might have never learned the truth.

The potential for things like that to be artificially inflicted upon others through the wave of a wand... it made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up and his heartbeat quicken.

He did not like the sound of that spell, even if he could see it was necessary for maintaining the International Statute of Secrecy. If there was a way of defending oneself against it though, Harry was one day going to master it.

\"Owning them is illegal,\" Draco spat with vicious satisfaction. \"I\'ll get the oaf thrown out for this.\"

\"Why?\" All of Harry\'s friends looked towards him with various degrees of confusion evident upon their faces. \"Why do you want Hagrid gone? He hasn\'t done anything to you, has he?\"

\"Well... no,\" Draco spluttered, blushing.

\"It would be a right shock to Weasley though,\" Theodore said with a vicious grin. \"Bet he\'d love that, eh Draco?\"

Draco\'s malicious expression returned with vigour. \"Exactly. It\'s not about the oaf. I mean, it is illegal and he should really be charged for breaking the law, but I don\'t much care about him. It\'s about Weasley. He was there, you know? He and Granger. Probably Longbottom too, but I couldn\'t see through the curtains. If that idiot gets caught for raising a dragon, maybe he\'ll take those three twats down with him.\"

Harry felt very torn.

Draco was his best friend, but he did like Hagrid. They exchanged letters every couple of weeks and he was probably the only adult Harry had ever somewhat trusted. For Draco to casually talk about getting him arrested just to hurt Weasley hit Harry in a way that made him unsure of what to do next.

For now, he would remain quiet. It seemed best to let the situation evolve. After all, there was a very real possibility that Draco would be unable to follow through on his threats. If Harry stayed neutral and this prospect came to light, he could remain on the best of terms with both Draco and Hagrid without risking himself in the process.

Yes, neutrality really was best --- at least for now.

***Meanwhile, in the Gryffindor common room...***

\"He\'ll have to get rid of it,\" Hermione was saying. \"Now that Malfoy knows Hagrid is raising the dragon, there really is no way he can keep it.\"

Ron snorted. \"Yeah, because raising it in a wooden hut would have gone so well.\" He rolled his eyes in an exasperated manner. \"Honestly, I don\'t know what Hagrid was thinking. I doubt even Fred and George would think that was a good idea, and those two are lunatics.\"

\"Getting rid of it isn\'t going to be easy though,\" put in Neville. \"Not now that Malfoy knows. I doubt he\'ll just let it go. Some of his friends, too. Potter\'s one of the best in the year, and if Nott\'s anything like his father---\"

\"Well, it\'s not exactly like we\'re planning for them to find out, is it?\" Ron asked rhetorically. \"That\'d just be stupid. We\'ll convince Hagrid to get the dragon off the grounds and just make sure Malfoy and his group of gits never figure out what we\'re doing.\"

Neville glanced at Hermione, but she could do little more than shrug. \"It\'s probably the best idea we\'ll be able to come up with,\" she admitted. \"Obviously, we need to work out the details and make sure we\'re clever about the whole thing, but I don\'t really see any other option.\"

Reluctantly, the three of them got to work.

***April 30, 1992***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***8:46 PM***

\"That\'s really all we can cover for the first-year material,\" Gemma was telling Harry. \"You\'ll ace your wanded subjects with no issue. The theory-based classes will really just come down to how much you study. You know all of the material, it will just be about remembering all of it on the day.\"

\"Thanks, Gemma,\" said Harry. \"This has actually been really helpful.\" He hesitated. \"If we\'re done with the first-year material and you don\'t think we can do much more preparing for the exams, does that mean these sessions are over?\"

There was a note of hope in Harry\'s voice. Not for the sessions to be over, but for the prospect of their continuation. He had truly enjoyed them and had learned a great deal. His absolute highlight of these sessions had been when Gemma had taught him the Knockback Jinx. He had mastered it in no time, something that had impressed her greatly. He felt as though she could teach him a great many more things, so a part of him hoped this wasn\'t the end of these sessions.

Gemma frowned. \"It technically should be,\" she said slowly. \"I was meant to help you prepare for the exams and I\'ve done that.\" She paused, taking in the openly nervous expression her younger counterpart wore. \"I\'m not all that worried about my N.E.W.T.s, though. I know I\'ll get the necessary grades and this is only an hour a week anyway. I... could continue if you\'d like; there just really isn\'t any need.\"

Harry had a difficult time asking people for things. It was something that had been trained out of him by years of living with the Dursleys. It took a great deal of effort to overcome the impulse to stay quiet, but he managed it. He knew that if he did not speak up now, his request would never be met.

\"Whataboutteachingmethesecondyearstuff?\"

Gemma blinked. \"Come again?\"

Harry blushed. His question had come out rushed and garbled. He took a deep breath. \"What about teaching me some of the second-year stuff? Maybe even just some useful spells for duelling like the Knockback Jinx? I\'m really interested in Defence and that was really fun.\"

Gemma considered him for a moment. \"Okay,\" she agreed. \"I\'ll teach you, so long as you\'re willing to learn anything I ask of you without questioning it.\"

Grinning, Harry nodded, happy that they had come to an accord so easily.

***May 2, 1992***

***The Grounds of Hogwarts***

***8:13 PM***

Ron, Hermione, and Neville left Hagrid\'s hut that night with very mixed emotions.

On one hand, they had finally managed to convince their giant of a friend to transport the dragon off of the grounds.

Hagrid had always gotten on well with Ron ever since the boy had arrived at the castle back in September. The Gamekeeper had greatly enjoyed his brother Charlie and he had invited the Gryffindor trio into his hut for tea after Ron caught the snitch in Gryffindor\'s opening match of the season. After they had realized what he was raising, entered his hut, called him out on it, and *still* kept his secret, a deep bond of trust had been formed.

Ever since the egg had hatched and Draco Malfoy of all people had become aware of it, the trio had been doing their best to convince Hagrid the dragon needed to be moved. He had been more than a little bit resistant to the idea at first, but tonight, they had finally made him see reason.

Though they had come to several other revelations.

Apparently, the three-headed monstrosity in the third-floor corridor belonged to Hagrid. Hermione still hadn\'t been able to learn anything about cerberuses, but this one was also named Fluffy, of all things. The fact was one Hagrid had slipped when speaking of how the tale of his monstrosity had drawn the attention of a hooded man in a bar. A hooded man who then gave Hagrid a dragon\'s egg after a game of cards, but not before Hagrid had told him exactly how to get past his pet monster.

Ron, Hermione, and Neville were reasonably worried this man had nefarious goals in mind. They had been sure for months that the dog was in the castle for the sole purpose of protecting whatever lay below that trapdoor.

\"That ain\'t none o\' yer business,\" Hagrid had told them when they had inquired as to exactly what that thing was. \"Tha\'s between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.\" He had then frozen with the look of someone who had just had a bucket of ice-cold water dumped over their head, snapping them brutally out of whatever trance they had been in. \"I should not o\' told ya that,\'\" Hagrid had said. \"I should definitely not o\' told ya that.\"

But he had, and the trio had a new goal.

Or, at least they had.

It had taken only minutes for them to solve the question of exactly who Nicholas Flamel was. Not through any brilliance on any of their parts, but through a pure stroke of luck.

Neville had removed a Chocolate Frog from his pocket on the way back up to the castle. Its card had been one of Albus Dumbledore and there on its back was the name Nicholas Flamel.

\"He\'s in a book I have up at the castle,\" breathed Hermione, hardly being able to believe their good fortune. \"Come on, I\'ll get it when we\'re back in the common room.\"

Ron had the most peculiar feeling that whatever Nicholas Flamel was involved with, it was only going to make this whole situation all the more complicated.

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***8:13 PM***

\"So let me get this straight,\" said Theodore. \"Weasley was bit by the dragon and went to the hospital wing?\" Draco nodded eagerly. \"Then, he was stupid enough to take a letter from his brother with him? Or to leave it out on the table, depending on when he got it?\"

\"Yes,\" said Draco, pushing out his chest sounding extremely smug about the whole thing. \"But it\'s even worse. The letter basically explains exactly how they plan to sneak the dragon out of the castle. I\'m going to tell the professors and watch the idiots get caught. They\'ll be punished --- hopefully, the weasel too --- and the oaf will be gone.\"

Harry had thus far stayed quiet, but as Draco explained his plan, he came to the unfortunate conclusion that it would work.

Which meant neutrality was no longer an option.

He liked Draco and his friends immensely. He liked them more than Hagrid if truth was to be told, but he knew this wasn\'t right. Hagrid might have broken the law, but he shouldn\'t be used as some pawn to get at Weasley over something as childish as jealousy born from Quidditch success. It was stupid and Hagrid was one of the few people Harry liked. He had never thought about it before, but he supposed this proved to himself he would happily break the law for people whom he viewed in a favourable light.

That was, as it happened, a significant revelation, and it was one that he would need to think on later.

Harry pulled Draco aside some minutes later. \"What is it?\" the blond asked, still very much high on his preemptive victory.

\"Can I ask a favour?\"

Draco\'s eyebrows knit together. \"Of course.\"

\"Drop the whole business with the dragon, all right?\"

Draco\'s eyes narrowed. \"Why would you want me to do that, of all things?\"

\"Because Hagrid doesn\'t deserve to be thrown in prison.\"

\"Harry, he\'s breaking the law. He\'ll be tried just like anyone else who breaks the law.\"

\"I don\'t care about the law.\" And he realized it was true. Probably due to years of harsh rules imposed upon him by the Dursleys. It had given him an unorthodox outlook on things. Actions didn\'t matter to him so much as intentions. \"Hagrid\'s a good person. That\'s all that matters in the end, right?\"

\"I don\'t care about Hagrid,\" Draco said, the Gamekeeper\'s name spoken with obvious distaste.

\"Well, I do.\"

Draco frowned. \"Why on earth would you care about him?\"

\"He was the person who introduced me to the magical world, Draco. I know he isn\'t perfect and that he\'s... not what you would call put together. But... that first day, it means something to me. You know I lived with muggles and you know how much I hated them. Hagrid was the one who helped me get away. If not for him, I might not be here. That\'s important to me. And who really cares about Weasley? He\'s just some kid, at the end of the day. Is some fight in school really worth what you\'re going to put someone through?\"

Draco seemed to think about that very deeply. \"Fine,\" he said with a blank expression. \"I won\'t go through with my plan.\"

Harry had the oddest sense that Draco was lying. Something seemed to tingle within him, but he ignored it. Draco had never lied to him before, nor had he ever led Harry astray. The Slytherin youth couldn\'t imagine his best friend doing anything of the sort over something as important to him as this.

He smiled with relief, ignoring the odd feeling that persisted even now. \"Thanks, Draco. I appreciate it.\"

His friend\'s blank mask didn\'t change. \"Don\'t mention it, Harry.\"

***May 9, 1992***

***Hagrid\'s Hut***

***12:23 AM***

Rubeus Hagrid was dreaming.

In this dream, he imagined watching the dragon he had recently let go of soaring high in the sky, fully grown and at its majestic best. Fire spewed from the creature\'s mouth like forcefully propelled streams of molten lava as the beast let out roars that tore across the land. He also thought he heard a great banging sound, but that was most out-of-place for this dream.

He felt as though something was... stinging him, but he could not for the life of him understand why. It wasn\'t a sensation he had felt before in a dream and it was one that greatly confused him. The stinging eventually grew intense enough that, with a jolt, Hagrid woke from his deep slumber.

He awoke to the sight of a cluster of men in auror uniforms gathered around his bed, all of them with their wands levelled and hard, stony expressions upon their faces.

\"Wha... wha\'s goin\' on \'ere!?\"

\"Mr. Hagrid,\" boomed a deep, baritone voice belonging to a dark-skinned man wearing a badge that marked him as a Senior Auror who stepped forward. \"We are here to inform you that you are under arrest for the illegal breeding, ownership, and potential smuggling of a several-week-old Norwegian Ridgeback.\"

Hagrid\'s eyes bulged as the blood drained from his face and his skin lost all colour.

***About thirty minutes earlier\...***

The moon was bright on this night, nearing the end of its lunar cycle and shining mostly full in the dark, velvety sky. Its light shone and cast the massive, black outline of Hogwarts castle into sharp relief, making its shadowy form look both ominous and sinister.

Inside this castle, something ominous really was taking place. Something that was dangerous and not exactly legal, at the very least, and something that felt ominous to those carrying out the deed in question.

\"Time check,\" ordered Hermione in a hasty whisper.

\"Sixteen minutes to midnight,\" answered Neville in the same tone of voice.

\"Perfect,\" said Hermione. \"There won\'t be any prefects for the rest of the way. We\'re in the clear as long as none of the ghosts are waiting for us.\"

Sneaking through the castle at night and trying to get a crate containing a live dragon up to the astronomy tower was more than a little bit challenging. Ron --- still currently in the hospital and recovering from the dragon\'s bite --- had come up with a stroke of inspiration. It, along with an unreasonable amount of luck, was the only reason the two first-year Gryffindors had yet to be caught.

He had seen how his brother, Percy, had a schedule detailing at what time each of the prefects were to patrol each floor of the castle after curfew. The plan had been simple. Steal one of those schedules and plan their trek up to the astronomy tower around the patrol times. It wasn\'t a perfect course of action by any means, but seeing as they couldn\'t exactly become invisible, it was the best thing they had.

And thus far, it had worked, they had only a short distance left to traverse.

The two of them stepped out from their hiding place --- a small space behind one of the many suits of armour that was cast into dark shadow by the lowly-lit torches flickering in their brackets all along the corridor --- and made their way towards a tapestry across the way. Pushing it aside, they revealed a long staircase; one that led straight up to the astronomy tower.

They ascended carefully, hearts racing in their chests like hastily beaten drums as they did so.

They had made it.

No patrols were set to be atop the astronomy tower for the next number of hours. They had actually done it; they made it through the entire castle without being stopped!

The dry air of the night hit them as soon as they stepped back outside. The breeze seemed stronger now that they were so high above the ground which stretched out far beneath them. The two of them actually took the time to exchange victorious glances, both of them in total disbelief that their plan had actually worked.

\"And what exactly are the two of you doing at such an ungodly hour of the night?\"

The cold, silky drawling voice made both Gryffindors\' blood run cold.

From out of the darkness near the edge of the tower stepped the Hogwarts Potions Master, his eyes glinting ominously in the night as he loomed towards them; eyes that fell on the crate in their arms.

\"Oh dear,\" he said in barely more than a whisper. \"I do hope the rumours of what is in that crate turn out to be falsehoods. If they don\'t, I fear that a number of people are in a great deal of trouble.\"

***Back in the present, in the headmaster\'s office...***

Neville shakily finished retelling his side of the story, adding to what Draco Malfoy --- who sat in a third chair across from the Headmaster alongside him and Hermione --- had already stated. Draco was looking more annoyingly smug than Neville had ever seen him and Hermione had been quietly crying for the duration of the meeting.

Dumbledore sat back in his chair and sighed whilst Professors Snape and McGonagall --- both of whom stood nearby --- remained still and silent.

\"I hope the both of you, as well as Master Weasley, understand just how serious this transgression really is.\" Hermione\'s crying became deep sobs at that and Neville was looking anywhere but at the wizened man sitting across from him. \"I would have expected better from the both of you. You, in particular, Miss Granger. You are an immensely talented witch and I had hoped the events of October the 31st had taught you a very valuable lesson.\"

\"I-I\'m s-s-so sorry, H-H-Headmaster,\" sobbed Hermione. \"It\'s a-all my f-f-fault. I should never have d-done it and now I\'m g-going t-to be exp-p-pelled.\"

Her voice broke on the last word and she began shaking uncontrollably, sobbing heavier than ever and looking altogether like she was having a complete and total breakdown.

\"Miss Granger,\" said Dumbledore in a voice that was surprisingly soft and kind given the situation at hand. \"Please do cease the more extreme bits of your reaction. I can tell that you are most upset and this is indeed a very serious matter. I can, however, assure you that, on this night, you are not going to be expelled from this institution.\"

\"I\'m not?\" asked an awe-struck Hermione just as an incredulously furious Draco exclaimed \"WHAT?!\"

\"Do calm yourself, Master Malfoy,\" Dumbledore chided gently. \"I won\'t have such shouting at this time of the night.\" Draco snapped his mouth shut, though his glare did not waver. If Dumbledore noticed, he didn\'t show it, choosing instead to let his stare fall on Hermione and Neville once more. \"No, Miss Granger,\" he said, \"you are not being expelled tonight. Neither is Master Weasley, nor is Master Longbottom.\"

\"But... we broke the law.\" Neville stomped painfully on Hermione\'s foot in an attempt to get her to shut up. He was hardly going to complain about not being expelled; his gran might have actually killed him if that event had come to pass.

It was in Hermione\'s nature to speak on such things, though. It wasn\'t that she was arguing with Dumbledore and stating that she wanted to be expelled. It was that, according to the rules, she should have been. She was simply trying to understand why they weren\'t being followed to the letter.

\"You did,\" agreed Dumbledore. \"You broke both law and curfew tonight and under the rule of many men, you likely would not be permitted to continue studying here. I, however, have a habit of seeing the best in people and situations alike --- as my many critics will happily tell you.\" He looked towards Draco with complete and total innocence. \"Why, young Draco here has surely heard his father harp on that quirk of mine many a time. Isn\'t that right, Master Malfoy?\"

Draco spluttered, obviously having no idea how best to answer that question. Dumbledore was merciful enough to continue the conversation as if nothing had happened, though Neville did notice the corners of the old man\'s lips threatening to tug upwards.

\"I believe in second chances, Miss Granger. While what you did tonight was very serious and something that is undoubtedly wrong, it is not something I can categorize as evil. I have never expelled a student from this castle, and the first time I do so will not be for three first-year students going out of their way to help a good-hearted man out of a most unfortunate position. Whilst the actions themselves are flawed, the intent was good and pure.

\"Oftentimes, actions are merely the manifestations of poorly thought out ideas and the results of flawed execution. An action can spark from a great many things, not all of which accurately reflect the person who carried them out. Intentions are pure, undiluted, and quintessentially reflective of whomever it is that has them. In my humble opinion, it is intent, not actions, which define a person. Actions are in many ways the brain meddling in things it sometimes shouldn\'t. Intentions are, in the purest form, the most vibrant picture of a person their heart can possibly paint.

\"I will not have either of you, nor your friend, Master Weasley, expelled for acting on such pure intent. Of course, you did break both the rules and the law, so these actions cannot go entirely unpunished. Gryffindor will lose 150 points --- 50 from the both of you and Master Weasley --- and you will all serve detentions once a week until the end of the school year.\"

Malfoy looked livid at this, clearly unable to believe they were getting off --- in his opinion --- so easily. \"What about Hagrid?\" he spat.

Dumbledore suddenly looked very old indeed. \"I have no power over what happens to poor Rubeus. I can only hope the authorities are merciful and advise him the way I think is best going forward.\" Dumbledore glanced up at the clock on his wall. \"On the note of Rubeus, I would like to depart for the Ministry of Magic as soon as possible to see if the Department of Magical Law Enforcement might just hear my take on things. It is already quite late, all things told, so I think I\'d best be on my way if nobody has anything else to add to this late-night meeting.\"

Nobody spoke.

\"Very good. Minerva, Severus, please escort your charges back to their respective common rooms. Master Malfoy, we thank you for your courage in coming forward. You did what was right instead of what was easy, which is an admirable quality in any young wizard. For your courage and upstanding acts, take twenty-five points for Slytherin.\" Dumbledore clambered to his feet. \"And with that,\" he said, striding over to a nearby table, taking a handful of floo powder, and throwing it into the fire. \"I must be off. A good night to all of you.\"

He stepped into the roaring flames and vanished, leaving a very tense silence behind him.

***May 9, 1992***

***The Great Hall***

***8:22 AM***

***HOGWARTS GAMEKEEPER ARRESTED FOR THE BREEDING, OWNING, AND ATTEMPTED SMUGGLING OF A LIVE DRAGON!***

***By Rita Skeeter***

Harry\'s hands shook as he held Pansy\'s copy of the *Daily Prophet* and read the lurid headline.

Draco had been looking extremely smug up until that moment. When Harry took note of the massive decrease in rubies filling the Gryffindor\'s hourglass and then saw the newspaper, Draco\'s face had paled and all swagger was gone.

As for Harry himself, he was furious.

Not only was one of his few genuine friends in the world now in serious trouble with the law solely because of another member of that same, exclusive group, but Draco had lied to him. He had done it to his face and without showing even the slightest sign of guilt.

The worst part was, Harry had known it.

He had almost always known when he was being lied to as a child and he had felt it that day speaking with Draco. The sense that the boy\'s words hadn\'t been honest, but he hadn\'t wanted to believe it.

He had wanted to believe that his new friends were different and that they wouldn\'t lie to him with the same cruel callousness deployed by the Dursleys for ten long years.

The newspaper in Harry\'s hands burst into flames, causing several screams from nearby as it curled into ash on the table in front of him. He looked up to meet Draco\'s eyes and suddenly felt an odd sensation of panic that was most definitely not his own.

It did nothing to quell his rage.

Draco\'s glass exploded, spraying his morning tea this way and that, scalding those unfortunate enough to be in its path.

Harry didn\'t care.

He had gotten to his feet before the glass had fully exploded and --- before any of his friends knew what was happening --- had stormed straight out of the Great Hall.

Still sitting transfixed and frozen in his wake, Draco Malfoy wasn\'t sure what worried him more.

The painful burns that now coated his hands and face, or the livid look his sister was levelling him with. A look that screamed of how, this time, he might truly have ruined everything.

**Author\'s Endnote:**

**Well, this one ended up being longer than I had planned --- especially considering it was at one time going to be conjoined with chapter 9 --- but I\'m actually quite happy with it. I\'ve personally never seen Hagrid actually take the fall for the dragon, which baffles me, so I thought I would switch things up a bit with this story.**

**If you can\'t tell, the ripple effects to what might seem like a minor change will be quite substantial.**

**Two more chapters left to go in book 1, so I hope you\'re already for the climax of first year!**

**Also, I would respectfully ask people to please stop asking about the pairing. I will never answer questions about it and you will not change my mind. It exists, it is not slash, and it is not multi. Beyond that, you will have to keep reading to find out.**

***The Entrance Hall***

***11:00 PM***

It was abnormal for Ron, Hermione, and Neville to be out of bed this late. Curfew had come and gone some time ago and now, the castle was eerily quiet. It was because of this silence that they could hear each shuffling footstep from the squat man who approached them, holding aloft what appeared to be a gas lantern of some sort.

\"Come with me,\" growled Filch, walking straight towards the castle\'s exit without making sure his three charges followed.

They did, but not before exchanging nervous glances.

Glances that only grew all the more fervent as they were led down the sloping lawns, drawing closer and closer to both Hagrid\'s hut and the outskirts of the dark forest that stretched beyond it.

\"Sir,\" asked Hermione in the most polite tone of voice one could possibly imagine. \"Where exactly are we going, if you don\'t mind my asking?\"

Filch took the time to glance at them over his shoulder. The moon was bright in the clear sky and so was his lantern. In their combined light, the three children had no difficulty making out his twisted, cruel expression.

\"The forest is where you\'re goin\'.\" He sounded extremely satisfied, as if nothing could have brought him more pleasure.

\"The f-forest?\" asked Neville.

\"Yes, the forest. Maybe if you opened your ears and listened the first time, you wouldn\'t have to ask the second.\"

Neville flushed a colour as crimson as the hair belonging to the tall, gangly boy who walked alongside him. \"S-sorry,\" he stammered, \"it\'s just... the forest is supposed to have all sorts of dangerous creatures, isn\'t it?\"

Filch shrugged in an unconcerned sort of way, though all three of them could tell he was greatly amused by the whole thing. \"Shoulda thought of them creatures before you went and broke the rules, eh?\"

Ron opened his mouth, but he closed it promptly when Hermione stomped painfully on his foot. They had not only violated school rules, but they had quite literally broken the law. As far as she was concerned, they had gotten off easy. It wasn\'t something she wanted to risk making worse, particularly in light of that fact.

\"Is that you, Filch?\" It was a voice none of the Gryffindors had heard before. A voice that sounded rough, but also as though it belonged to an old man.

\"The first years, Professor Kettleburn,\" Filch said oily. \"Here for their... punishment.\"

\"I know why they\'re here, you cantankerous old lump.\" Filch opened his mouth, then closed it, grinding his teeth together whilst the other man huffed indignantly.

\"They\'re here to be punished, remember,\" Filch gritted out through clenched teeth. \"You mustn\'t be too nice to them---\"

\"I haven\'t even spoken to them yet, you miserable old prune.\" Filch spluttered, looking more and more furious by the second. \"Just because I enjoy making you look like an arse doesn\'t mean I don\'t know what detention is. Really, I think that\'s your problem. What would you have done with them, you greasy codger? Strung them up by their wrists and ankles while you whipped them until their skin was raw?\" He huffed. \"Honestly, between you thinking I can\'t hear and don\'t understand what the hell a detention is, and the tossers on the board of governors thinking I can\'t teach just because I\'m missing a finger or two, this job is getting old very fast.

\"Now,\" he said, gesturing sharply in the direction of the castle. \"If you can\'t tell by now, your pitiful presence isn\'t needed or wanted. Off with you, you miserable old goat.\" Filch looked livid, but he shuffled back up towards the castle\'s hulking outline nevertheless.

\"Pathetic,\" the professor muttered under his breath. \"He\'s as useless as that Merlin-forsaken poltergeist. Honestly, we have house-elves for a reason. Why can\'t we just bin the git?\" He shook his head as if realizing where he was and who was standing in front of him. \"Right, sorry about all that, lads and lass. I\'ve never gotten on with that useless sack of dragon dung.\"

Ron and Neville were too busy trying to not crack up to respond. Hermione looked utterly appalled, but she managed to compose herself and speak nonetheless. \"It\'s... okay, Professor\...?\"

\"Kettleburn,\" he said. \"I\'ve been teaching Care of Magical Creatures since before any of your parents were even thought of.\" Neville gave an odd twitch at this. Ron didn\'t notice and Hermione didn\'t quite understand why, so the moment passed without comment.

\"Sir,\" asked Ron, finally over his amusement and now shifting back and forth in obvious discomfort. \"Are we really going into the Forbidden Forest?\"

\"Yep,\" said Kettleburn, sounding entirely unconcerned. \"I\'m just gonna get that old hound from Hagrid\'s hut, make sure you lot at least know how to shoot up sparks, split us into two groups, and we\'ll be off.\"

\"But... why are we going in there?\" Ron asked. \"Isn\'t it supposed to be really dangerous?\"

\"Most of what\'s in there is harmless to us. Just don\'t piss it off and we\'ll be all right.\"

\"And... why?\"

\"Hm? Oh yes, that. Something has been attacking unicorns and one\'s been injured for days, just stumbling around and waiting to die. We\'ll be finding it and hopefully saving it.\" The man grimaced. \"More likely, we\'ll be putting it out of its misery.\"

Neville gulped. \"And... what if whatever\'s killing the unicorns finds us before we find the one it\'s been hunting?\"

Kettleburn waved his hand, which did indeed appear to be missing two fingers. \"Semantics, my dear boy. Now, come with me; let\'s get this old, fat dog some exercise.\"

***A few hours later, in the Slytherin dorms...***

Harry stood in a dark, cavernous room; the likes of which he\'d never seen before. The closest comparable he had were the underground tunnels at Gringotts. Somehow, he could tell that this room was situated far beneath the earth\'s surface. Harry felt like the ceiling was very high, though the room itself was so dark, he couldn\'t possibly be sure.

As if the thought had spurred them on, oil-fuelled torches burst into light all around the room, flickering ominously and casting long, dark shadows across the floor and walls; all of which seemed hewn from the same, rough stone.

Then, something else caught Harry\'s attention.

There was but one thing in this vast, mysterious place, but Harry recognized it at once.

An ornate mirror taller than he was, one which showed him only the barest outlines of shadowy things he could not identify. The mirror\'s surface sparkled invitingly in the torchlight, but this time, Harry averted his eyes. He remembered what Professor Dumbledore had told him about this particular mirror.

\"*This mirror will give us neither knowledge nor truth, Harry. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. The mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, and I ask you not to go looking for it. If you ever do come across it again, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live. Remember that.\"*

He averted his eyes from the mirror just as a rushing sound erupted from behind him. He spun to see towering black flames roaring and impeding what seemed to be this place\'s only exit.

Or, perhaps, they were an attempt to block its only entrance, for the silhouette of a figure could be seen in the fire not a moment later.

Before Harry could identify the hooded man whose face was cast in shadow, he almost gasped at the sight of glowing red eyes. Then, a wand was brandished and there was a horrible flash of blinding green light. Harry jolted awake in the Slytherin dormitory, shaking and sweating as if he had a horrid fever.

Harry stood shakily, trying to gain control of his breathing as he tried to ignore his pounding headache and made sure not to wake Draco. His eyes fell on his treasured cloak.

He needed a walk.

***Later, in the Forbidden Forest\...***

The foliage only grew thicker as Neville, Hermione, and Fang strode deeper and deeper down their chosen path. Ron and the eccentric Professor Kettleburn had gone in a different direction, but not before encountering several centaurs. Kettleburn had merely greeted them, inclined his head, and moved on, though all of them could feel the creatures\' eyes following them as they continued on their respective paths.

It had been difficult to track the unicorn blood for quite some time. The forest canopy obscured much of the light coming from above, which was mostly limited. Though the moon shone brightly, the thick veil of clouds seemed to scud in its way, obscuring its luminescent light.

Thankfully, the blood itself was a silvery colour that was hard to miss. It was now growing thicker as, up ahead, the two students and one boarhound could make out a break in the foliage.

They stepped into the clearing just as the clouds seemed to take pity on the moon, allowing its silvery spotlight to reach them once more.

The scene the light illuminated before them was as majestic as it was appalling.

A brilliant creature laid prone and helpless in the centre of the clearing, legs jutting out at odd angles and head lulled. It was clear the creature was dead, though judging by the blood still gently oozing from the gaping hole in the unicorn\'s side, it hadn\'t been that way for long.

The silvery substance pooled all around it, gleaming in the moonlight in magical ways, seeming to send impossible sparks of light dancing incomprehensibly, as if the very photons were mourning the death of such a precious manifestation of purity and happiness.

Naturally, the scene of morbid tranquillity set out before them could not persist for long.

There came a rustling from across the clearing, like some great serpent slithering menacingly across the fallen leaves. Hermione instinctively clasped her hand over the boarhound\'s mouth to stop it from crying out as it had earlier that night when a similar sound had made itself known.

This time, they got to see exactly what was causing it.

A figure strode purposefully forward. It was of average height for a man and was donned in a black, hooded cloak. The cloak was long; it covered the figure\'s hands and the garment was obviously what had been rustling the leaves.

It crept slowly towards the fallen unicorn without a glance around the clearing. That at least was fortunate, for it most definitely would have spotted the two youths watching it, as well as their four-legged companion.

Fang shook free of Hermione\'s grip just as the figure bent its hooded head over the gaping wound and began to drink the creature\'s blood.

Neville gagged and Hermione paled, but Fang\'s booming bark was what alerted the figure to their presence.

By the time it stood, the hound had bolted, pulling Hermione --- who had attempted to take hold of his collar --- to the forest floor, where she lay prone and terrified.

Neville felt the start of panic tear at his innards, but the boy suddenly had an epiphany not too dissimilar from the one he\'d had the night of Samhain. The one that he credited as the beginning of a much-needed shift in his character.

He was not going to let his friend die here in this forest.

He was the son of Frank and Alice Longbottom, two of the best aurors the Ministry of Magic had seen in decades. He was the heir to not only their legacy, but a Founding Twelve family, and he was also a Gryffindor. It was times like this when one needed to choose between what was right and what was easy.

He drew his wand and stepped forward, levelling it at the figure and hoping it didn\'t see the way his arm shook. \"Who are you and what do you want?\"

The figure didn\'t respond. It instead reached into a pocket of its robes and withdrew its own wand. It was long and dark, and it was what the figure aimed at Neville with.

Neville simply reacted, firing off a Leg-Locker in hopes it might take the figure off guard.

Since he had purchased his new wand, Neville\'s performance during class had indeed improved. He wasn\'t all of a sudden Merlin or any such nonsense, but he had definitely progressed in his ability. Transfiguration still gave him problems --- to say the least --- and he was far from outstanding at Charms. Potions was really best left unspoken of, though he was at least good at Herbology.

As well as Defence Against the Dark Arts... Neville seemed to have a talent for that class.

The spell he chose was an early second-year incarnation and it flew towards the figure at top speed.

Neville was somewhat surprised he\'d gotten it to work so well, but all pride died in his chest when the figure casually batted it away with a mere flick of his wand, the tip of which was now glowing a vibrant red colour as it aimed directly at Neville, who realized by now he would die at any moment.

Before the blow could come, the foliage exploded and out of it charged a creature Neville had only seen once before. It had been earlier that very night, in fact.

The centaur leapt through the air, lashing out at the figure with its hoof. The cloaked being barely evaded, casting several spells to hold the centaur at bay before it fled from the clearing at a run, leaving the half-man, half-horse creature alone with a shaking Neville and a quietly sobbing Hermione.

\"Are you all right?\"

Its voice was deep and smooth, and it spoke of concern and worry. More than anything, though, it stayed calm and did not waver.

\"Y-y-yes,\" stammered Neville, his eyes still fixed on where his assailant had stood. \"What-what was that?\"

The centaur didn\'t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at both Neville and Hermione --- who was once more on her feet --- and his eyes lingered on the former.

\"You are the Longbottom boy,\" he said. \"You had better get back to Kettleburn. The forest is not safe at this time. Can the two of you ride? It will be quicker this way.

\"My name is Firenze,\" he added as he lowered himself onto his front legs so that both Neville and Hermione could clamber onto his back.

There suddenly came the sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Two of the centaurs from earlier that night came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.

\"Firenze!\" the more fierce-looking of the two thundered. \"What are you doing? You have humans on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\"

\"Do you not understand who these humans are, Bane?\"

\"What have you been telling them?\" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?\"

Ronan pawed the ground nervously. \"I\'m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,\" he said in a gloomy sort of voice.

Bane kicked his back legs in anger. \"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\"

Firenze suddenly reared onto his hind legs in anger, so Neville had to grab his shoulders and Hermione had to grab Neville to stay on.

\"Do you not see that unicorn?\" Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane. Yes, with humans alongside me if I must!\"

Firenze whisked around with the pair of first years on his back clutching on as best they could. They then plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.

\"What was that about?\" asked Neville once they were out of hearing range. \"Why are they so upset? And what was that thing you saved us from?\"

Firenze slowed to a walk, warning both of his passengers to keep their heads bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Neville\'s question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Neville thought Firenze didn\'t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when the centaur suddenly stopped.

\"Do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\" he asked the two of them.

\"No,\" said Neville, startled by the odd question.

Even Hermione seemed perplexed. \"We\'ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\"

\"That is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn,\" said Firenze. \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenceless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\"

Neville stared at the back of Firenze\'s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.

\"But who would be that desperate?\" Hermione wondered aloud. \"If you\'re going to be cursed forever, death is better, isn\'t it?\"

\"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else --- something that will bring you back to full strength and power --- something that will mean you can never die. Do either of you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\"

\"The Philosopher\'s Stone! Of course --- the Elixir of Life! But I don\'t understand who---\"

\"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, Miss Granger? Nobody who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\"

It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Neville\'s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, Neville swore he could hear his own heart beating along with the rhythmic padding of his escort\'s hooves.

There had been rumours for years among the most well-educated of Britain\'s wizarding population. Rumours that an event so integral to the country\'s history hadn\'t quite gone exactly as the media had portrayed it. Why, even his gran had her doubts as to whether that fateful night had been quite as magical as some had thought.

But surely, Firenze couldn\'t mean...

\"Neville, Hermione!\" It was Ron\'s voice calling to them as he, Kettleburn, and Fang --- who must have found them after bolting off into the forest --- approached.

\"Go to them, but remember what I have said,\" intoned Firenze. \"Remember all you have heard and remember that Mars shines bright tonight. It is a herald of things to come.\"

Just like that, Firenze prompted their dismount and bolted back off into the forest; a state of awestruck shock, disbelief, and terror befalling the both of them.

Could it truly be possible that Lord Voldemort was seeking to return to power?

***Sometime later, atop a balcony overlooking the grounds\...***

Harry had wandered the school for some time before he realized sleep wasn\'t going to be an option. His mind was now active and reeling, thinking on a great many things; things that most certainly did not lend themselves at all well to the realm of Morpheus.

He tried to get his mind off of the dream he had experienced. Exploring the castle had worked for a time, but the thoughts could only be held at bay for so long before they reared their ugly heads with renewed vigour and resolute determination.

The problem was that even before that time, his default thoughts --- not associated with the dream, that is --- were of his friends. While that wasn\'t a bad thing in and of itself, it made him think of his current predicament with Draco.

That was... complicated, and it was most certainly not what he wanted to think about at this time of night while less than emotionally stable.

It was that thought which had brought him to the same balcony he had shared twice with Diana earlier in the year whilst they had spoken of things which had, at the time, left him in a state not too dissimilar to the one he found himself in on this night.

It was only now that Harry realized this place had become a sort of haven for him.

The sun had not yet risen, but it had begun to tease the horizon with its bright halo of light. The moon could still be seen high in the sky, but its light was less vivid now. The sky around it was becoming brighter, and Harry was beginning to be able to see the grounds and all that they contained more clearly.

What they contained on this morning appeared to be a procession of four walking towards the castle.

This piqued Harry\'s interest and he squinted.

It was difficult to tell exactly from this height, but he could definitely make out the vivid red hair of a Weasley, and he thought one of the figures looked an awful lot like Hermione Granger.

The question was, what on earth were the two of them --- and presumably Longbottom --- doing out on the grounds at this ungodly hour of the morning?

Harry knew it was a question best left unanswered and one that he certainly didn\'t have the necessary pieces to solve.

But still... he couldn\'t help but feel it was oddly significant somehow. He couldn\'t help but feel he was missing something important.

Something that was connected to why they were there in the first place.

***Several hours later, at Malfoy Manor\...***

Malfoy Manor\'s immaculate informal dining room was mostly quiet aside from the occasional clattering of cutlery as the lord and the lady of the house finished their meals in silence.

Narcissa was not a morning person, so Lucius was surprised she was even awake. He would have been even more surprised if she were talkative at this time of the morning, and he\'d never had an aversion to spending time with his own thoughts. It was often when many of his more ingenious ideas would come to him.

*CRACK!*

He could have sighed aloud when one of the infernal creatures that manned the house appeared before him as if summoned by the mere thought of his enjoyment of solitude.

He took a long, languid sip of tea as he enjoyed how the pitiful thing squirmed before him, obviously worried what mood it might find its master in this morning.

\"What is it?\" When Lucius finally spoke, his voice was cool and emotionless.

\"A letter, sir and miss,\" said the elf, his tennis ball-sized eyes looking anywhere but at his masters.

\"Give it here.\" The elf levitated the envelope onto the table. It knew it wasn\'t to touch anything its master might touch soon after. That had led to punishments in the past.

Lucius opened the envelope with a lazy flick of his wand and withdrew the plain-looking bit of parchment within.

Its contents were anything but plain.

By the time Lucius had finished reading the very brief missive, he was deathly pale. His wife had leant over to read it as well, but before she could, the envelope burst into flames, curling into ash on the table.

Ash which briefly rested in a very distinct shape on the table before it too vanished.

A skull --- one with a serpentine tongue protruding from its mouth.

***On the Way to the Slytherin Common Room***

***8:49 PM***

It had been an odd few weeks for Harry since the dragon incident had been not-so-peacefully resolved.

None in the castle had seen Hagrid since that night, which caused many rumours to spread like hissing wildfires. If Pansy was to be believed --- and she was rarely wrong about such things --- Hagrid would be put on trial in July. Until then, he would be held at the ministry in a holding cell. The wizarding government of Magical Britain apparently wasn\'t all that concerned with making this trial punctual. Pansy said it just wasn\'t really that important in the grand scheme of things, but Harry didn\'t see why they couldn\'t at least do Hagrid the favour of a quick trial.

He hadn\'t spoken with Draco since that morning in the Great Hall when he had inadvertently set his newspaper ablaze and caused the youngest Malfoy\'s mug of tea to explode. Allegedly, Draco needed a burn salve from Madam Pomfrey, but Harry wasn\'t punished for the incident. He had been asked to stay behind in Potions the next time the class arose on his timetable, but Snape had just advised him to keep a much firmer grip on his emotions.

It had really been awkward ever since that morning. Theodore had been the one who had stuck most closely with Harry. They spent much of their time in the library; with Theodore mostly studying for the fast-approaching exams and Harry looking ahead to the second-year material. Pansy flitted between Harry and Draco, trying to play diplomat between the two of them. Draco apparently felt quite awful about what had happened, but Harry couldn\'t bring himself to care. Unless Draco had the stones to come and tell it to him in person, Harry would be having none of it.

Diana had briefly approached Harry, but she hadn\'t pressed him about the incident with Draco. It had just been a reminder that her brother could be a right prat sometimes and that if Harry ever needed to talk, she was always available.

Tonight was one of the rare instances Harry was alone. Theodore was studying in the library, but Harry hadn\'t been all that interested. He had been more inclined to explore the castle under his invisibility cloak; an activity which had become a favourite pastime of his ever since he had received the magical artifact on the night of Yule.

He was nearing a staircase that would take him down to the castle\'s ground floor when he stopped. He had an odd feeling he was no longer alone; a feeling that was validated seconds later when Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Neville Longbottom came around the corner.

Harry\'s attention suddenly piqued for reasons he could not entirely articulate. Their heads were pressed together and they were discussing something in frantic, hissing whispers. Harry could feel it was important. It was much like the way he could tell when somebody was lying; he could feel their unease and guilt as they spoke. He could feel the nervousness, anxiety, and downright fear rolling off these three first years in waves.

He wasn\'t sure what made him follow them, still under the guise of his cloak, but he wanted to know what it was that had terrified them so much. Especially after spotting their ascent up to the castle at such an ungodly hour earlier in the week. What was it that could make those who dwelled within the house of the brave so very worried?

\"\...he\'s not going to hold out much longer,\" Granger was whispering as the three of them stepped into an abandoned classroom. Harry just managed to follow stealthily behind them right before the door closed.

\"What happens if he gives in?\" Longbottom\'s voice was frantic, panicked, even.

\"We\'ll have to do something,\" said Weasley. \"It might get us into trouble if the teachers find out how much we know, but we can\'t let Snape get the stone. Especially not if he really is going to give it to... him.\"

The... stone? What on earth could Professor Snape want with a stone? A bezoar, perhaps, but if they were talking about that particular kind of stone, surely they would have called it by name.

\"I think we\'re all forgetting something,\" said Granger. \"If it really is You-Know-Who that\'s coming after the Philosopher\'s Stone, wasn\'t it said that Professor Dumbledore was the only one he was ever afraid of?\"

\"Yup,\" said Ron while Harry felt a wave of shock bowl straight over him. \"Even when he was strongest, the dark git never attacked Hogwarts.\"

\"Well, there you go. So long as Professor Dumbledore is here, we should be safe, right?\"

Harry knew she didn\'t believe it and he was pretty sure neither Weasley nor Longbottom were fooled either.

Though he couldn\'t be certain.

He was far too busy reeling from that last revelation.

You-Know-Who after a Philosopher\'s Stone?

The only Philosopher\'s Stone he had ever heard of had been featured in muggle myths. A stone so fantastical that Harry couldn\'t even believe it existed in this wild world of magic. If he was remembering correctly, it had the power to turn any metal into gold and make the drinker immortal.

If such a stone existed...

If Granger, of all people, was talking about such a stone, it wasn\'t terribly far out of the question that it may well exist.

And if it did...

Voldemort going after a stone like that... Suddenly, he was back in the shack on that rock again and Hagrid\'s words were ringing in his ears once more.

\"*Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\"*

Could it really be possible that Voldemort was alive and seeking the Philosopher\'s Stone? He knew that the official stance was that Voldemort had died the night he attacked Harry and his family, but he also knew that some, like Hagrid, were more sceptical of that conclusion.

But if he was back...

He had wanted to kill Harry and his parents before. Was it possible he would try and kill Harry again? Even if he hadn\'t been the true target the first time, he had sought to kill him. More importantly, he had failed. Harry didn\'t know much about Voldemort, but from the little he did know, he could easily see vengeance being a powerful motivator. If Hagrid was to be believed, many thought the reason he\'d attacked the Potters in the first place was that they had refused to join him.

That made the idea of him attacking Harry as soon as he returned to power all the more probable.

But, surely, this was all ridiculous.

Weasley, Granger, and Longbottom were all schoolchildren, just like Harry. He knew too well the tendency most schoolchildren had to exaggerate events. It was far more likely that they were making fantastical tales out of things they didn\'t really understand.

Yes, that would probably be it. If Voldemort really was alive and on the prowl once more, it wasn\'t as though Weasley, Granger, or Longbottom would know about it.

That was what Harry told himself, anyway. He needed to tell himself *something* to keep the terror at bay, even if that thing wasn\'t entirely successful at doing that.

***June 4, 1992***

***The Entrance Hall***

***3:52 PM***

The sound of bustling students could be heard all throughout the castle. Most of the students in question were flooding into the castle\'s entrance hall and out the large, oak front doors.

It was only natural, of course. Exams had just concluded and with their passing went any educational obligations the students had until September. This alone would have driven most out of the castle. Add to that the fact the sky outside was a vibrant blue so bright and unblemished that its presence would not have seemed out of place in some fantastical utopia, and it was really a no-brainer for the students to flock out onto the ground.

Such was the case for almost all in the castle, but there were a few notable exceptions.

Namely, a trio of first-year Gryffindor students who had just sat their final exam of the year --- History of Magic --- and who were actually just as stressed as they were relieved.

Days had passed since they had overheard Quirrell wilting under the pressure applied to him by Snape and they knew the Potions Master\'s time was running out. If he or Voldemort were to make a move on the Philosopher\'s Stone, it would need to be made soon.

And something seemed auspicious about this day.

Perhaps it was the utopian feel of it all. Maybe it just felt too perfect and the fact was triggering the youths\' paranoia. Or perhaps striking on a day like this really was the most Slytherin thing to do and all three of them knew it.

They just felt like something was going to happen and they felt it finally time to make the man in charge of the castle they resided in aware of such things.

They had spoken at length about the whole situation quite frequently over the past few days and had come to a number of disturbing revelations.

Not least of which was that it had been distinctly odd how Hagrid had gotten his massive hands on the egg. The thing he wanted most in the world just so happened to show up right in front of him, just as the person delivering it seemed to have been oh so interested in something the giant man himself owned.

It was a touch too convenient for the trio\'s liking.

\"What if it was You-Know-Who under that hood?\" Ron had asked. \"It seems the obvious thing to do, doesn\'t it?\"

Neither Neville nor even Hermione had been able to dispute the logic of such things. Hermione had managed to convince the others to wait until exams were over before running off to Dumbledore --- but the time for stalling had now officially come to an end. They could not wait idly around any longer.

\"What are you three doing inside?\"

It was Professor McGonagall and she was carrying a large pile of books.

\"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hermione.

\"See Professor Dumbledore?\" Professor McGonagall repeated with narrowed eyes. It was clear even to the three Gryffindors that their unusual request had raised the woman\'s suspicion at once. \"And why exactly would you want to do that?\"

\"It\'s sort of\... secret,\" said Ron, unable to think of anything better on the spot. He suddenly wished he had because Professor McGonagall\'s nostrils flared.

\"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\"

\"He\'s gone?\" Neville said frantically. \"Now?\"

\"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Longbottom, he has many demands on his time---\"

\"But this is important,\" cut in Ron.

\"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic?\"

\"Look,\" Ron continued, throwing caution to the winds. \"Professor... it\'s about the Philosopher\'s Stone---\"

A resounding crash echoed through the hall, clear remnants of Professor McGonagall\'s most recent action, which had been dropping the stack of books that had been precariously balanced in her arms a second earlier. She looked both livid and shocked, and it was a combination that put all three students on edge.

Hermione spoke next, obviously realizing that allowing Professor McGonagall to begin on a tirade would be unwise. \"Professor, we think --- we know --- that Sn-that someone\'s going to try and steal the stone. We\'ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\"

McGonagall now looked a mixture of dazed and annoyed, as well as more than a tad flustered. \"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\" she said finally. \"I don\'t know how you found out about the stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it. It is far too well protected.\"

\"But, Professor---\"

\"Granger, I know what I\'m talking about.\" She gathered up the fallen books with a wave of her wand. \"I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.\"

But they didn\'t.

They did a far more Gryffindor-like thing than simply following orders.

They acted and made a plan of their own.

***Meanwhile, out on the grounds...***

It really was a beautiful day, Harry thought as the warm summer breeze rustled his unkempt black hair and teased his skin. He bathed in the warmth and light of the day as he flew like a bird through the sky, laughing and shouting alongside his older companion, who flew beside him and basked in the glow with an equal amount of delight.

Harry had just finished his final exam and with it, his first year was all but in the books. Now, he had only to wait for the final weeks to pass and for his marks to come back.

There was a small part of him that dreaded the fast-approaching year\'s end because with it, he might well need to return to the Dursleys. The best thing about the year hadn\'t been the magic, nor the people, nor even the castle itself; though Harry had immensely enjoyed all of those things. The absolute best part of the year had been that, for its duration, he had been free of the people who had made his life hell since before the age of two.

He still planned to ask Dumbledore whether or not he could stay at Hogwarts over the summer holidays, but his hopes were not high. He had subtly brought it up to Draco a couple of months back when they had still been on speaking terms. The blond had responded by saying that, as far as he knew, no one had ever stayed at Hogwarts during the summer.

Despite the dread and worry that threatened to flood into his chest, Harry managed to stay feeling light and free. A protective bubble of happiness seemed to be keeping those dark thoughts at bay, and it was something Harry was very grateful for.

\"Down there!\" called Cassius, catching Harry\'s attention and gesturing to a large tree near the lake.

Beneath the massive tree sat Diana and her friends as well as Draco, Pansy, Theodore, Crabbe, and Goyle. Harry and Cassius swooped around the tree and came in for a landing much the same way Harry and Draco had all those months ago when Cassius had first seen Harry fly.

When they landed, Harry\'s emerald eyes briefly met the stormy grey of Draco\'s, but they didn\'t linger long. Harry\'s attention was instead drawn to Diana, who was laying out a full-scale picnic for all of them, whilst her friend --- Yaxley --- spread out a blanket large enough to accommodate all present.

\"To the end of another year,\" said Diana once everyone had a beverage in hand. \"And to many more good ones to come.\"

They all toasted and drank. In that moment, Harry couldn\'t perceive a thing that would effectively manage to burst his bubble of euphoric happiness.

It truly was just a day worth celebrating.

***Later that night, in the dungeons...***

Harry breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Draco slipping off towards the dormitories. He had been pursuing Harry for the better part of the day, but the last Potter just wasn\'t at all interested at the moment. He had been having quite an enjoyable day. The last thing he wanted at the moment was to have a deep, potentially emotionally charged conversation. He would talk it out with Draco and he really did hope they would re-establish their friendship. He just knew that today wasn\'t that day and that it would need to wait until he was in a different state of mind.

He had also been experiencing horrible headaches for the last day that he couldn\'t quite explain. Having that discussion right now really wasn\'t the best of ideas.

Once Draco had gone off to bed, Harry decided it was time to go exploring. He had discovered many secret passages and other interesting oddities of the castle over the year. Rather than satisfy his thirst, they had only made him all the more insatiable, which was how he found himself stalking out of the dungeons under the invisibility cloak on this particular evening.

One floor he hadn\'t explored quite so thoroughly was the third. There was of course the out-of-bounds corridor on the right-hand side, so Harry had avoided the floor as a general rule. Before he\'d had the cloak, he had been worried about getting caught anywhere near the off-limits corridor. That was no longer a problem, but the habit had already been long-established by the time he had received his most prized possession.

With exams for the year over, however, Harry suddenly felt bolder than he had before, so he thought tonight was the night.

After arriving on the floor in question, it took about three seconds for him to find something of interest.

Muffled voices were coming from around a corner and Harry stealthily snuck towards them, curious to see what it was that was happening.

\"I heard you,\" Peeves was saying in a sing-song voice, eyes flitting all around the corridor. \"Peevesey knows he heard you. Come out, come out, wherever you are, little students. Peevesey just wants to play.\" No one moved and the poltergeist crossed his arms. \"If you don\'t come out and Peevesey finds out, he\'ll turn you in to the greasy old caretaker.\"

Still, no one moved and this time, the poltergeist actually huffed before zipping off down the corridor, clanging every suit of armour as he went; probably as a way of venting his obvious frustration.

Harry wondered what that was all about until three figures stepped out from an alcove Harry actually had not yet found. He was somewhat taken aback by how unsurprised he was to see Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom, and Hermione Granger. It was as if these three were everywhere.

\"That was close,\" he heard Weasley mutter. \"Imagine we\'d been caught by Peeves. Wouldn\'t even make it to the bloody corridor.\"

\"Shh,\" urged Granger, briefly covering Weasley\'s mouth with a hand before leading them off towards what Harry immediately realized to be the off-limits third-floor corridor.

He actually found himself incredulous a moment or so later when the very door that had been shrouded in such mystery yielded to a simple Unlocking Charm.

The three Gryffindors were in the corridor and had closed the door before Harry could see what it was that lurked inside, but his heart was racing as his brain began to connect the dots.

Weasley, Granger, and Longbottom had been talking days earlier about the Philosopher\'s Stone and of how Snape --- or maybe even Voldemort --- could potentially be after it. Harry had dismissed these comments as heresy. He still found the idea of either Snape or Voldemort going after the stone ridiculous, but it was said that oftentimes, the truth laid between two extremes.

So was it possible at least part of the trio\'s tale had been true?

Was it possible that the famous Philosopher\'s Stone was the treasure situated in the corridor?

A lot about that hypothesis was problematic, but Harry decided it was best to at least pretend it could be viable.

He wouldn\'t be risking his life to find out, but surely there couldn\'t be any harm in waiting outside the corridor to see what happened when the trio eventually emerged.

Or didn\'t, he supposed. Out of bounds to all who do not wish to die a very painful death, and all that.

Harry shrugged; he supposed he would just need to wait and see. He was hidden under his cloak, so getting caught wasn\'t exactly a risk he needed to worry about and by now, he was much too curious to turn back.

***Sometime later, in the catacombs beneath Hogwarts...***

Neville faced the black fire before him with a resolute expression.

He still thought Hermione sending him of all people forward was one of the craziest ideas anyone had ever had, but he hadn\'t been able to come up with a good enough argument off the cuff. He was better at Defence Against the Dark Arts, and it was true she could probably get back up to the main castle to search for a professor faster than he could

That still didn\'t mean he adored the prospect of facing down what could potentially be Lord Voldemort. It might only be Snape, but that was hardly a favourable challenge, either.

He wasn\'t sure what allowed him to do it. He couldn\'t entirely quantify it; all he knew was that it was the same fire that had filled him to the brim back in the forbidden forest that previous week and in the bathroom on Samhain.

Just like he couldn\'t let his friends die, he couldn\'t let Voldemort get the Philosopher\'s Stone. Not after the monster had left so many families like his own broken and ruined in his wake of death and destruction. Even if he ignored the atrocities of the past, Neville could not allow a future to exist where Voldemort had returned. Not only would the country be in disarray once more, but people like Hermione would be hunted to extinction if the mass-murdering psychopath had his way.

He drank the potion and walked forward, marvelling at how the black flames --- which completely obscured his vision --- did little more than tickle his skin. It felt more like submerging in a pleasant bath than walking through ten-foot-high flames.

Soon enough, the sensation had passed entirely, for Neville had entered what he instinctively knew to be the final room.

It was dark and vast like an ancient cavern, with a high ceiling and smooth stone floor and walls. The room was entirely empty except for its two notable exceptions.

The first was a tall, ornate mirror with an odd engraving that Neville couldn\'t make heads or tails of. It was unlike any mirror Neville had ever seen.

The other exception to the room\'s emptiness was a hooded figure who stood directly in front of the mirror. Neville quickly realized the cloak it wore was eerily similar to the one he had seen in the forest.

He raised his wand, hand shaking, and aimed.

\"You can come out,\" called a soft voice from near the mirror. \"I know you\'re here.\"

Neville fired off three spells in quick succession, but they all splashed harmlessly against a lazily conjured shield.

Fire raced towards Neville, who dove to the side. The flames followed him but --- just before burning him to death --- their tendrils cooled, solidified, and morphed into rough ropes that bound Neville\'s arms and legs together. His wand went clattering to the floor at his feet while he himself collapsed in a heap directly next to it.

\"So it\'s you, is it?\" asked the voice that Neville actually hadn\'t been able to identify until now. He had heard it plenty of times, but it had stuttered around him.

It was Professor Quirrell.

\"I\'ll admit, I wasn\'t sure whom to expect. I was hoping for Potter, though I knew it was a slim chance at best. He seems to have more sense than to rush off into battles he can\'t win.\" His eyes gleamed. \"You though... you may actually be better suited for what I need. I\'m not quite sure Potter actually has the heart for this little trick to work.\"

Quirrell twitched his wand and Neville was jerked to his feet and dragged forward by the ropes that bound him.

\"Why you?\" he asked, knowing he had to keep him talking. \"We were expecting Snape!\"

\"Were you now?\" asked Quirrell, sounding amused. \"Severus is many things, but I do not think he is loyal to me any longer. I think that bridge was burned a great many years ago now.\"

Loyal to... me?

Snape had never been loyal to Quirrell, but according to Neville\'s gran, he had been rumoured to be loyal to another at one point.

Which meant...

\"You\'re... him!\"

The man or monster wearing Quirrell\'s skin tilted his head. \"What an interestingly complex question,\" he mused. \"I am, and I\'m not. I\'m certainly not Quirinus Quirrell, but I don\'t think I can say that I am Lord Voldemort quite yet, either.\"

\"Then who... what---\"

\"Enough talking,\" the assailant snapped. \"What I want from you, Neville Longbottom, is your compliance. Look into that mirror while thinking of the Philosopher\'s Stone and tell me exactly what it is you see. Do not lie to me. I will know if you lie.\"

\"Why should I listen to you?\"

\"Because if you don\'t, I will simply force you to do it with magic. I am not a man of many morals, but I am not a liar. You can trust me when I say it will be much easier for you if you look into that mirror of your own free will.\"

\"It won\'t matter,\" gritted out Neville. \"Hermione\'s off to get the professors, maybe even Dumbledore if he\'s back. You\'ll never get out with the stone, even if you do get it.\"

\"By the time Albus Dumbledore reaches this castle, I will be gone. Anyone short of him will be swiftly and easily dealt with. Now,\" he snapped, \"look into the mirror and tell me what you see!\"

Neville felt the ropes contract painfully around his throat and he immediately realized he had no choice but to comply.

When he glanced into the mirror, he first saw the smiling face of two people whom he recognized very well, though he had never seen them this healthy in life.

Then, the image slowly changed.

Those people were lying in hospital beds, looking much more like how Neville knew them. He was there, too, but there was something different about him. He looked more confident than Neville had ever felt as he reached into the pocket of his robes and produced two vials of golden liquid. He handed one to each of his parents before reaching into his robes once more. He withdrew a blood-red stone, turned it over in his hands, winked, and plopped it back into his pocket.

And that was when Neville felt the stone appear just where his mirror-self had put it.

\"Excellent,\" said the man behind him with satisfaction and Neville could only feel complete terror at the fact he had immediately known when the stone had appeared to him. \"I\'m afraid your questions will remain unanswered, Longbottom. Your words of the other professors hold true and this will be much easier if I make haste. I thank you for your assistance... both willing and unwilling.\"

A flash of red light illuminated Neville\'s vision and then he saw no more.

***Minutes later, back outside the third-floor corridor...***

Harry had begun to seriously consider just going back to the common room after so much time had passed; but his patience was rewarded by something of interest not minutes after those contemplations had begun.

He found himself beyond perplexed when a frantic-looking Hermione Granger exploded out of the corridor and charged down the hall at a flat sprint, disappearing quickly around the nearest corner and running still further out of sight.

This made Harry frown, but he was at least reasonably sure something more was going to happen that might pique his interest.

If he had known what said thing would be, he would never have waited there in the corridor.

It was some time before the door leading to the forbidden hall opened once more, but when it did, it was no panicked school child that exited.

It was a hooded man whom Harry recognized nonetheless as the nearest torch did indeed manage to cast his face into sharp relief.

Seeing his favourite professor exit from the forbidden corridor might have been surprising enough, but that wasn\'t the sight that made Harry gasp aloud.

That was the sight of Neville Longbottom, helpless, bound by ropes, and clearly unconscious while he floated alongside the professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts.

The same professor froze at the sound of Harry\'s gasp. \"Who\'s there?\" asked Quirrell in a voice as sharp as steel. Harry did not so much as move as he watched Quirrell\'s wand raise.

His heart stopped beating for a second. Never had he put his cloak to the test against actual detection spells. He knew they existed, but nobody had ever suspected his presence while he had been wearing his most precious piece of clothing. He had no idea whether it would stand up to whatever Quirrell was about to cast, nor did he want to know.

He liked Quirrell; the man had actually been his favourite professor --- even despite the constant headaches Harry felt while in his class --- but Harry was no fool and he thought he had a pretty good idea of what was going on here.

He, like every other student at Hogwarts, was all too aware of the supposed curse placed upon the Defence Against the Dark Arts position many years ago. Not one professor had lasted the entire year in decades and Harry had heard the phrase \'When in doubt, blame the Defence professor,\' more than once.

And here was Quirrell, a competent but also quiet and mysterious man, exiting the forbidden corridor that may or may not house the Philosopher\'s Stone at an ungodly hour.

Oh, and he had a hostage. There was also that.

Harry may have liked Quirrell, but he wasn\'t delusional.

It appeared that the Gryffindor trio may actually have been half-right in blaming a professor after all --- even if their mention of Voldemort now seemed foolishly far off the mark. They had just guessed the wrong professor, by the looks of it.

Harry just stayed hidden, pressed firmly up against a wall as he hoped beyond hope his cloak would ward off whatever detection spell Quirrell chose to cast.

\"Homenum Revelio.\"

Harry could... feel something. Like a wave rolling out from Quirrell, but nothing happened.

The man actually looked very surprised for all of a second before his jaw hardened.

\"Ventus Divinum.\"

What seemed to Harry like hurricane-force winds erupted from the end of Quirrell\'s wand. His cloak may have protected him from the previous spell, but it was not impervious to physical effects. It fluttered in the wind and came straight off of Harry when the boy himself was flung through the air like a carelessly discarded ragdoll.

He hit the ground hard, feeling the air leave his lungs as Quirrell dispersed his spell with a sweep of his wand.

\"Ah, Potter,\" said the professor with a gleam in his eyes. \"I had wondered whether or not I might run into you. Fate does have a funny way of meddling in the affairs of greater men.\"

\"S-sir,\" stammered Harry, doing his best to play dumb, \"what\'s---\"

\"None of that from you, Potter. You are too sharp to suddenly be ignorant and your mind is as open as a book. I know you have correctly interpreted the situation and I must say, your deductions are quite impressive, if not entirely accurate.\" The man\'s face hardened. \"Unfortunately, that only makes you all the more dangerous. You know too much and I won\'t have you be my undoing yet again. You have two choices, Potter, and I urge you to choose wisely. Join me and forever hold your tongue, or oppose me and die.\"

Harry only half heard the final bit of Quirrell\'s monologue.

\"*I won\'t have you be my undoing again.\"*

That didn\'t fit Quirinus Quirrell. Harry had never done anything to oppose him. It wouldn\'t have fit Snape, either. The man clearly didn\'t like Harry, but the Slytherin youth had never done anything to warrant such an opinion.

No, that statement would only hold true if this was one man. A man who many thought to be dead and a man whom Weasley, Granger, and Longbottom had seriously considered as a legitimate suspect.

\"Voldemort,\" Harry breathed out in little more than a hissing whisper, his throat constricting as his heart beat faster and faster.

\"In a sense,\" the Dark Lord mused, all urgency seemingly forgotten as he fixated on the boy who had held his quiet interest for the better part of the year. \"I am far from what I once was, thanks to you. Do you see what you have done to me, Harry? For years, I have been little more than a vengeful spirit hoping beyond hope he might one day find a way back to the glory he once basked in. Even now, so close I am to what I have sought for so long, I must poach off the bodies of lesser men and drink the blood of unicorns simply to keep this body from failing.\"

The Dark Lord\'s eyes were practically boring a hole in Harry now as if trying to memorize every detail. For his part, the youth in question was frozen and unable to move from fear. His limbs felt as though the blood within them had been frozen solid and they now weighed a hundred pounds each.

\"But that all ends tonight,\" hissed Voldemort. \"I will have my own body once more when the elixir of life is mine and for that to happen, I need only to escape this castle with the stone in hand.\"

He looked positively demented and even whilst in another\'s body, Harry had no difficulty envisioning this man as a mass-murdering psychopath simply from the look on his vessel\'s face alone.

\"But... how?\" he breathed. \"Your power was supposed to be broken.\"

\"Oh, it was, but the greatest among us always find a way. Those who have pushed the boundaries of magic further than any other aren\'t bound by the same restraints as the mere mortals cowering around them.

\"But you are different,\" Voldemort purred. \"I have seen it in you this year. You remind me more of myself than any child I have ever met. Potential the likes of which have not been seen since my departure from this castle and a beautiful inner darkness that can be honed into so many wonderful things.\"

\"Potential... inner darkness?\"

Voldemort ignored him. \"You don\'t need to suffer the fate of those foolish enough to oppose me, Harry. You can be greater than them, but only alongside me will you fulfil your true potential. Do not waste it by throwing your life away so carelessly. Not after your parents gave their lives for you. Do not repay them with a deluded sense of morality that will only see their sacrifice be for not.\"

\"You... want me to join you?\"

\"I do... very, very much.\"

\"Even after you killed my parents?\"

Quirrell\'s face tightened. \"It was a necessary evil. I take no pleasure in ripping families apart. Especially not when spilling pure, magical blood like that of your father. I will not apologize for what I have done. You do not deserve to be lied to by your parents\' murderer, but I will apologize for all of the hardships my actions have caused you. Allow me to atone for those evils by giving you things you could never have without me.\"

\"What things?\" By now, Harry was grasping at anything that might keep the Dark Lord talking.

\"Standing alongside me, you could help forge the world anew. You could tear down the corrupt system that would have seen your mother relegated to little more than a mere housewife. And the muggles... I know you have no love for them. Surely, you see the threat that they pose after having lived under their mercy for so long? You have seen their evil, seen how they live in constant conflict, and seen how they destroy anything they fail to understand? You must see the threat they pose if the Statute of Secrecy was ever to fall?\"

\"But it hasn\'t,\" countered Harry. \"The Statute has been strong for three---\"

\"Lies! That is nothing more than perpetuated propaganda. The Statute of Secrecy is weak and it has nearly crumbled on a number of occasions. Both world wars saw it come scarily close, and Gellert Grindelwald nearly tore it down single-handedly more than once.

\"There have been others, too. The French Revolution had its worrying moments and it has come so close to collapsing in America that wizards are forbidden from associating with muggles of any sort.\"

This was... a revelation for Harry.

He had no love for muggles, as Voldemort had correctly assumed. He had seen their cruelty first hand and he knew all too well that the Dark Lord spoke the truth.

One thing in particular that Voldemort had said hit home with Harry.

How they destroy anything they fail to understand.

That had been the crux of the matter, hadn\'t it?

Nobody had understood him, and thus everyone had lashed out against him. The Dursleys had been the worst, but they hadn\'t been the only ones and it could be argued that, if others had spent as much time with him as his wayward relatives, they might have done just as much damage.

The Dursleys were not exceptions, from what Harry had seen. They might have been the worst he had witnessed, but no muggle had ever treated him with anything resembling kindness. The other kids had labelled him a freak and his teachers had been neglectful and only helped feed into the Dursleys\' abuse. The child services had failed as had every other system ever put in place by muggles.

All because they failed to understand.

And wouldn\'t that be the case for each and every wizard from what Harry had seen? What would happen if Voldemort was right and the Statute of Secrecy really did fall? The muggles would surely wage war on the wizards and though the magicals were, of course, superior in every way imaginable, there would surely be massive amounts of death and destruction on both sides. It would probably be more devastating than either world war and the effects of those were still being felt all across the globe today.

All of these thoughts formed solidly in Harry\'s mind for the first time and now, he saw the world in an entirely different light. Just like that, his entire worldview had shifted and now he stood, dazed, confused, and frozen before this man who had destroyed so much.

But had he been acting for a noble cause?

Did that excuse his actions? Did it excuse the horrible truth that he had murdered Harry\'s parents and sent his life into a downward spiral that he was only now just beginning to recover from? And what of his parents? What had they believed? Did it even matter? Could Harry possibly side with their murderer even if he agreed with the man\'s ideologies?

He had become so lost in thought he only now heard the frantic pounding of footsteps racing towards them down an adjacent corridor. He could practically feel the magic in the air as they drew closer.

\"Your time is up,\" snarled Voldemort, looking worried for the first time. \"Choose!\"

\"I... I...\"

Voldemort slashed his wand towards Harry. There was clear regret on his face, but there was also something animalistic in those eyes.

Harry dove to the side and managed to avoid the spell, but he landed quite painfully on his wrist.

Voldemort made to sprint from the corridor, but he was too late.

\"A pleasure seeing you tonight, Quirinus.\"

Harry recognized the voice and he wasn\'t sure how to feel about its arrival, likely because he now wasn\'t sure how to feel about the man who had just attacked him.

\"Dumbledore.\" Quirrell\'s voice escaped in a hiss, but it didn\'t sound fearful. Just unbelievably hateful.

\"That is my name, yes,\" Dumbledore spoke calmly and politely, but there was the unmistakable undertone of steel. \"I must admit, I find myself less confident that Quirinus is the name most appropriate for you. Can I assume that in a warped sort of way, the brilliant young Slytherin I taught all those years ago really did get the Defence Against the Dark Arts job he once claimed to want after all these years?\"

\"I tire of your games, old man. Step aside, allow me to pass, and nobody needs to die.\"

\"I\'m not sure you are in the position to make threats. You most certainly are not at full power in your current form, else you would never have sought Nicholas\'s stone in the first place. I\'m also not sure it would be wise for you to cast the Killing Curse in such a form. Least of all when your unsteady balance has been so reliant on unicorn blood as it is.\"

\"I don\'t need that curse to kill.\" When Dumbledore didn\'t budge, Quirrell\'s lips twisted up in a terrible smile. \"You always were a stubborn old fool, but your weaknesses have always been as glaring as the hideous robes you enjoy so much.\"

Voldemort twitched Quirrell\'s wand and Neville was thrust between himself and Dumbledore. The boy inverted so that he was upside down and very slowly, his head began to bend backwards.

\"Enough,\" said Dumbledore, and Voldemort stopped. Neville\'s head was positioned at a horrible angle, but his neck had not yet broken. Any with eyes could see, however, that another couple of centimetres would do it.

\"I am going to count down from five,\" said Voldemort, speaking in much the same way he might use if discussing the day\'s weather. \"If you do not step aside by the time I am done counting, this boy will die faster than you could possibly hope to prevent it.\"

\"If I agree, you will leave him---\"

\"That isn\'t how this works, old man; you\'re losing your touch. I will be taking him with me to the gates of this castle. All the while, I will be waiting. If I sense so much as a bead of magic form on the tip of your wand, this boy will die as quickly as he would have had you simply failed to stand aside. When I reach the point from which I can apparate away, I will leave the boy for you to retrieve.\"

Quirrell\'s eyes were dancing with mirth as the monster who occupied his body smirked cruelly at Dumbledore. \"What\'s wrong, Dumbledore? Is your convoluted game of chess not as fun when you\'re playing a fellow grandmaster? Surely by now, you\'ve learned that to win the game, you need to sacrifice some pawns?\" Dumbledore didn\'t answer and Voldemort smirked before becoming much more businesslike. \"My patience has thinned; your move, old man.\"

The pain in Harry\'s head --- which he now realized was somehow emanating from his scar, of all places --- had reached a fever pitch so intense he thought he might vomit.

But even through the pain, one thing was glaringly clear.

This was wrong.

He agreed with Voldemort that the muggles were a real threat. This was a startling revelation he had come to over the past number of minutes, but he couldn\'t support the death of an innocent child. Perhaps it was because he was young and naive, and perhaps he would grow out of it in time.

For now, though, it reminded him far too much of the way he had suffered. Nothing more than collateral damage in a bigger game. It was like the Dark Lord said. He had been a pawn Voldemort was willing to sacrifice.

He didn\'t want that to happen to Neville.

It wasn\'t even so much choosing Dumbledore\'s side as it was choosing to not allow one of the few things Harry held as evil from taking place.

Slowly, he began to crawl towards the Dark Lord.

\"Very well,\" said Dumbledore, sounding as though he had just swallowed a poisonous lemon. \"You may go.\"

Voldemort used Quirrell\'s face to grin in a way that spoke of a long-awaited victory as he marched forward with the air of a prince who was about to ascend to the throne he had sought for so long.

Until a small form belonging to a young, bespectacled boy launched itself forward and tackled him around the middle, sending them both sprawling.

Harry really had thought he was helping. He thought that by catching the Dark Lord by surprise, he might save his hostage\'s life.

What he failed to account for was that Voldemort could react much faster than other men.

When he made impact with Quirrell\'s body, something horrible sounded out from in front of them. It was as if a child had become bored playing with the delicate branch of a tree and chosen to snap it, but so much worse.

The sound echoed through the corridor, seeming to reverberate in impossible ways, speaking of the death and implications it brought with it.

Harry wasn\'t entirely sure how he would have reacted if rational thought was possible, but it was most certainly not. Even in the best of situations, he was reasonably sure that he would have fallen into shock.

On this occasion, he didn\'t even do that, for his head exploded with unadulterated agony.

Harry hadn\'t thought the pain in his head could get worse, but by Merlin it had.

When he touched Quirrell, his very scar seemed to explode, releasing years of pent-up agony and torture which all rolled over Harry at once.

Years later, Harry would vehemently claim the pain he felt in that corridor was far worse than the Cruciatus Curse, but he somehow soldiered on.

Voldemort --- whose wand had been knocked from his hand --- had reached for Harry\'s throat only to scream a high, terrible scream. The skin on his hand began to sizzle and burn away, revealing the very bone underneath.

And that\'s when Harry knew that Voldemort couldn\'t touch him.

Harry wasn\'t even really sure why he was still fighting. He supposed it was just a natural feeling of paranoia, now. Voldemort had gone for his throat. Any time someone had done that in the past, it had ended badly.

So Harry went for a vital point of his own.

He buried his fingers so deep into Quirinus Quirrell\'s eyes that they embedded themselves knuckle deep in the man\'s eye sockets, tearing through Quirrell\'s eyes as if they were no more than styrofoam.

The pain was too much for both of them.

Harry and Voldemort both gave one final scream of united agony before, almost in unison, their bodies slumped, unmoving, to the floor, leaving everyone in the corridor but the wizened headmaster lying motionless.

**Chapter 13: An Unexpected Detour**

***June 8, 1992***

***The Hospital Wing***

***2:24 PM***

When Harry finally awoke from many long and torturous dreams, the first sensation he felt was a burning pain behind his eyes. Probably because after so long without light, the copious amounts of it that flowed into his eyes was jarring to say the very least. Without his glasses on, the sensation was even worse as he could make out nothing around him but a bright blur closing in on all sides.

He wasn\'t sure how his glasses found their way into his hand, but they did, so he put them on; at which point he finally became aware of his surroundings --- though he was still blinking furiously from the onslaught of sudden light.

He was in an unfamiliar room with white walls and ceiling. Harry couldn\'t make out much of it, since he seemed to be isolated from most of the room. He was lying on a white, well-made bed, but there were curtains of the same colour all around him, closing him and his bed in on all sides.

\"Good afternoon, Harry.\"

Harry almost jumped at the voice. He did jolt, but he quickly slumped back down against his pillows when it sent a horrible stab of pain through his head.

\"Do be careful,\" the voice said. \"I would hate to be thrown out of my own hospital wing by an angry matron due to injuries you suffered on my account.\"

\"Professor Dumbledore?\" Harry asked, recognizing the voice from the few times he had heard it before.

He glanced towards it. Dumbledore was indeed there, sitting in an armchair that looked remarkably out of place. Somehow, Harry had a feeling the Hogwarts Headmaster had conjured it himself.

\"It is good to see you awake at last,\" the man said, and Harry couldn\'t help but notice how old and weary he appeared. He hadn\'t looked this way when they had spoken in front of the Mirror of Erised. Not even in that conversation\'s darkest moments.

Harry thought back to the last time he had been conscious. It was all really quite fuzzy and it took him at least a minute to begin putting the pieces together.

When he did, dread filled his stomach as something horrid ripped at his heart, trying to tear the strings like a vengeful child taking out their frustrations on an old, weathered guitar.

\"Neville,\" said Harry, voice breaking. \"Is he... I remember---\"

\"It is likely that you remember correctly.\" Dumbledore\'s voice was completely flat, which affirmed to Harry more than anything else that he did indeed have a clear memory of the events. \"I am sorry, Harry. I know you did your best to prevent that very thing from happening, and what took place on that night is nothing a child of your age should ever see.\"

\"It was my fault,\" Harry whispered. \"He said that if you attacked him, he would kill L-Neville. I... I thought he was only focusing on magic. I thought... I thought---\"

\"That if you surprised him with a physical assault, you might break the control he had over young Neville and create an opening for me to intervene?\" Harry nodded morosely.

Dumbledore sighed. \"First and foremost, I must dissuade you of any notions that this is in any way your fault. You did what you thought was best. It is true that it wasn\'t the most well thought out course of action I have ever seen, but such things are perfectly reasonable. You are still so very young, much as I know you hate to hear that. I said before that no child your age should ever see such things. Things like that... well, they make well-trained adults panic and do things that are not always wise. What you did was not the most appropriate thing in the moment, but it was perfectly reasonable given the context of such events. It would have been ridiculous to have expected anything different from you.\"

\"I still shouldn\'t have done it,\" whispered Harry. \"He said exactly what would happen if someone attacked him and I just ignored it.\"

\"You did not ignore it,\" Dumbledore said kindly. \"If you had ignored it, you would not have acted the way you did. You would not have realized the precarious position I myself was in, so it is likely you would have allowed me to react.\"

\"I don\'t want it to ever happen again.\" Harry\'s voice shook and though he hated the fact, he could do nothing to stop it.

\"Let us hope you are never again in a situation like the one you found yourself in that night.\"

\"But that isn\'t good enough,\" Harry argued. \"What if I am? What happens then? I... I don\'t want to panic again. It... it scares me. Making mistakes like that... Neville is dead because of it.\"

\"You think too singularly,\" said Dumbledore. \"There is no one reason Neville Longbottom is dead. Did your attacking the vessel of Lord Voldemort have an impact? Of course it did. Did a great many other things have an equal or greater impact? Yes, they did.\"

\"What other things?\"

Dumbledore didn\'t answer at once. \"Where to begin?\" he said at last. \"I could really start with all of the things that made Lord Voldemort the monster he is today, but I will not bore you with such things. Not unless it one day becomes necessary. Instead, I will go back to the final day of October in 1981. The very second Voldemort\'s power was broken, it was inevitable he would one day seek to return. It is not in his nature to accept failure and so long as even a part of him survives, he will always seek to return by any means necessary.\" Dumbledore\'s face suddenly scrunched up. \"And then, of course, there are my own mistakes to account for.\"

\"Your mistakes, sir?\"

\"Oh yes, Harry, and what a great number of them there are. You see, if there is any one person who should be blamed for the death of Neville Longbottom, you are looking at him.\"

\"I... don\'t understand.\"

\"No, I\'m sure you don\'t.\" Dumbledore took a minute to ponder his next reply. \"You remember the analogy that was made in that corridor about chess?\" Hesitantly, Harry nodded. \"It was... more apt than I would like it to be. I\'m afraid that when dealing with this particular situation, I tried to play so many moves ahead that it cost others dearly in the short term.\"

\"I\'m... missing some bits.\"

\"Hm? Ah yes, I suppose you are. You of course know that Lord Voldemort was after the Philosopher\'s Stone?\" Harry nodded. \"Did you also happen to know that the stone was created by one named Nicholas Flamel?\"

Harry shook his head but scrunched up his face. \"I\'ve... heard that name before.\"

\"I\'m sure you have. He is quite famous. I myself worked with Nicholas on alchemy for many years.\"

\"That\'s it,\" breathed Harry. \"He\'s on your chocolate frog card.\"

Dumbledore actually chuckled despite the mood. \"He is, yes. An interesting introduction to a most intriguing man. Nicholas is a man of many great achievements, but by far his greatest is the creation of the Philosopher\'s Stone.\"

\"So... he asked you to keep it, or something?\"

\"In essence, yes. Nicholas became worried for the stone not long before the school year was set to begin. You see, there was an attack on his property in France and it was deemed by both him and myself as too well-orchestrated to be the work of any but a most skilled practitioner of the darkest of arts.\"

\"So you moved it to Hogwarts?\"

\"It was much more complicated than that, but yes. It was first sent to Gringotts while I ensured certain protections were in place at the castle. Other things were considered, too. The Fidelius Charm was taken under strong consideration, but I dismissed it. Nicholas has participated in the charm\'s casting as many times as a person can and I confess, I wanted to save my available usages of it for a later date.

\"So, I decided it would be best for the stone to be hidden at Hogwarts.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"I had my suspicions even then that it was Voldemort who was after the stone. I was sure the protections I had set forth at Hogwarts were infallible and that he would not be able to pass them. Not through all of them, at least.\"

\"You were sure you could keep Vol-sorry. You-Know---\"

\"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.\"

\"Yes, sir. You... really thought you could keep Voldemort away from the stone?\"

\"I did, yes. If you will forgive my saying, some of the traps really were quite ingenious. Professor Snape had a most compelling puzzle, but I will admit, I was most fond of my two additions.\"

Harry felt an odd sense of curiosity. He was sure he wouldn\'t understand them now, but he wondered exactly what kind of protections the greatest wizard since Merlin would have come up with. He already hadn\'t understood one bit of the conversation --- something about a Fidelity Charm, or something --- but he was interested nonetheless.

\"Can... can I ask what your ideas were, sir?\"

\"Certainly. Between the two of us, a man like myself does grow bored of having his own genius stroked. In saying that, it is nice to explain one\'s thoughts to others from time to time.

\"If you pushed past that door and stepped into the corridor, you would come face-to-face with a cerberus.\" Dumbledore studied Harry. \"Do you know what makes that specific beast so deadly?\"

Harry shook his head. \"The only thing I know about them is that in muggle myths, they have three heads.\"

Dumbledore\'s lips twitched. \"They do indeed have three heads, but there is far more to it than that. You see, a cerberus is a very unique and powerful creature. Every single one of them is different. They cannot be killed nor even severely harmed by almost any magic we know of. Why, even the spell that took your parents away from us would be completely ineffective against a cerberus --- though many don\'t realize this.\"

Harry looked surprised. \"So they\'re invincible? How did Voldemort get past it then?\"

\"Ah, no, they are not invincible. Magic is, at its core, all about balance. The cerberus cannot be harmed by almost any magic so long as and only if they are protecting something, but they all have a weakness. It is different for each beast. No two cerberuses will have the same weakness, but they all have one. For Fluffy --- Hagrid\'s beast and the one who guarded the stone --- that was music. Play even a somewhat competent attempt at a tune and the beast would be asleep in seconds. Where magic comes in and balances these beasts is one of the things I find most fascinating. You see, if you have something valuable to protect, a cerberus will never be loyal to you. It is truly an interesting dichotomy. A creature that is tailor-made to protect will never be loyal to any who has something that is in need of protecting.\"

\"But it worked here because Hagrid didn\'t need the stone protected, Flamel did?\"

\"Precisely.\" There was an odd twinkle in Dumbledore\'s eyes as he spoke.

\"And the other protection?\"

\"That one will take much less explaining. I told you back months ago that the Mirror of Erised would be relocated, do you remember?\" Harry nodded; he was unlikely to ever forget anything about that mirror. \"Well, it was relocated and served as the final obstacle protecting the Philosopher\'s Stone. Above even the cerberus, this protection was why I was so sure Voldemort would be unable to get his hands on the stone.\"

\"Why\'s that, sir?\"

\"Think about how the mirror works, Harry, and now imagine for a moment that I have placed the stone within the mirror. I did some... tweaking of the artifact\'s enchantments and by the time I was done, it would have been impossible for Voldemort to remove the stone. You see, only those who did not want to possess the stone for any selfish reason could have looked into that mirror and had the stone given to them.\" His expression darkened. \"I did not, unfortunately, account for the possibility that students might go looking for it and that Voldemort might use one of them to remove the stone for him.

\"Do you see my mistake, Harry? I was so focused on combating the genius of Lord Voldemort that I forgot to account for the spontaneity of circumstance. It is a mistake I should not have made after so much time on this earth, but alas, I am the furthest thing from perfect.\"

\"You could never have known though,\" defended Harry.

\"True,\" said Dumbledore, \"just as you could never have been expected to react differently than how you did.\" There was a long, awkward pause.

\"I believe we have come to an impasse,\" Dumbledore continued. \"Let us cease this foolish game of trying to assign a force so arbitrary as that of blame. I am sure you have questions after the ordeal you went through.\" Harry nodded with a considerable amount of reluctance. He had never exactly been encouraged to ask questions by adults before. \"Ask away then, dear boy, and I shall answer; for I believe you have the right to know a great many things. Particularly in the wake of Master Longbottom\'s tragic and untimely passing.\"

\"What... what\'s going to happen with Neville\'s family? What will his parents do?\"

Harry wasn\'t sure why, but he immediately knew that he had said something wrong. Or at the very least, something that spoke of far deeper implications than he realized.

\"Nothing will change for Neville\'s parents.\" Dumbledore\'s voice was suddenly as hard as steel. Harry had never heard him like this; not even while confronting Voldemort.

\"Are-are they dead?\"

\"No, death would be far preferable to what Frank and Alice Longbottom went through.\" When Harry only looked at the Headmaster with wide, curious eyes, the man relented with obvious reluctance. \"Neville\'s parents were aurors --- they\'re something like the wizarding police, but they are a force consisting of the best of the best. They were very good ones, too. They defied Voldemort directly on multiple occasions and lived to tell the tale.\"

His expression darkened. \"Unfortunately, this painted a target on their back. In the days following your defeat of Voldemort, many of his followers grew restless in their search for their fallen master. Some of the worst of them attacked Neville\'s family, obviously hoping they had information as to where their master might be. Neither of them did, but their attackers cared not. They were both tortured into insanity and currently reside in a very specific ward in the magical hospital of Saint Mungoes. A ward for those whose minds have been torn so asunder by magic that they are not fit to live in our society anymore. Those in this ward have no hope of ever recovering.\"

\"Does... *did* he have any family?\"

\"His grandmother, yes. I have spoken with her already. It... was not an easy discussion to have.\"

\"Does she know what happened?\"

\"She does not.\" Dumbledore pierced Harry with his blue-eyed stare. \"The public does not know that Lord Voldemort survived that night. Many of them believe him dead and some are better for it. If it ever became public knowledge that he had not died that night, people might rally around him once more. At the very least, panic would sweep across the nation and do irrevocable damage. I know you must not understand, but the fear felt when Voldemort was at the height of his powers was unlike anything these isles have ever seen. It is imperative the secret of his survival stays between the two of us. I will not bind you to this secret by any means I know, but I will ask you, man to man, whether or not I can trust you to keep this secret?\"

Harry hesitated for only a second. He loved this new world far too much to see it fall into complete and total disarray. \"Yes, sir; you can trust me.\"

\"Very good. Now, I\'m sure you have more questions?\"

\"Voldemort still hasn\'t really gone then, is he? He\'ll try to come back again, won\'t he?\"

\"No, Harry, he has not gone. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to take over... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. I would say he left Quirrell to die, but there was none of him left. You never knew Quirinus Quirrell. You know only Voldemort, for it was merely Quirinus\'s corpse under that monster\'s complete and total control. He was weakened greatly by this form, but it was better than death, and so what if it cost an innocent man his life?

\"Lord Voldemort shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time --- and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.\"

\"How... what happened when I tackled him? His skin, it... it burnt.\"

\"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\'t realize that love as powerful as your mother\'s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Voldemort, full of hatred, greed, and ambition could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\"

\"Voldemort will just try and use the stone again, won\'t he?\"

Dumbledore suddenly became very interested in a bird on the windowsill outside. \"That isn\'t something we will need to worry about in the future, no.\"

Harry blinked. \"What?\"

\"Nicholas and I have had a chat about this very subject, and we both thought it best for the stone to be destroyed.\"

\"Destroyed?\" Harry asked, incredulous. \"But... that means... he\'ll die, right?\"

\"They have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.\"

Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry\'s face. \"To one as young as you, I\'m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicholas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all --- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\"

\"Sir?\" asked Harry, trying to stall for time whilst he worked out how to phrase a... riskier question. \"How long was I unconscious?\"

\"A little over three days, I\'m afraid. Your friends have been quite worried. You will no doubt have noticed the tokens of worry and friendship they have sent you.\" He gestured to piles of sweets and other confections lying around the room that Harry had failed to notice up to that point.

That gave him another idea for a question to ask while he tried to put his thoughts into safer words. This one really was something he did want answered.

\"Sir... what\'s going to happen to Hagrid?\"

\"I wish I could be sure myself. He will stand on trial at some point in July. The Wizengamot will decide his fate, and I can only hope they will be merciful.\"

Finally, Harry felt comfortable in attempting to phrase this next question.

During the confrontation, he had wondered about his parents. He had wondered about their ideologies and how they compared to Voldemort\'s. He had wondered how it was they had differed and now, he wondered what they would think of Harry\'s inherent distrust of muggles. A distrust that Voldemort had effectively cast into sharp relief during their short but enlightening --- if terrifying --- discussion.

\"Sir... why did Voldemort attack me and my parents?\"

\"What is it that inspires this line of questioning, if you do not, of course, mind my asking?\"

\"Just... some things Voldemort said.\"

\"I see.\" There was a pause of a few seconds during which Dumbledore seemed to be considering something. \"I should not tell you,\" he said. \"You are far too young for such truths, but you are also far too young to have seen what you have already seen. I will not tell you today, but I will make a bargain with you.

\"Starting at the beginning of next year, I will teach you --- if you are willing, of course --- to protect your mind. Once I am satisfied with the progress you have made on that front, I will give you an overview. I will state from the onset the details will not be revealed to you until you are older. There are things it\'s really best you don\'t know just yet, but I will at least answer your question in general terms. Is this agreeable to you?\"

It wasn\'t the answer Harry was hoping for, since it really didn\'t answer his question at all. If Dumbledore was only going to give a vague idea, it might not answer his question in the long run, either.

But something the man had said had piqued Harry\'s interest. \"Defend my mind, sir?\"

\"Indeed.\" Dumbledore studied him closely. \"There is a branch of magic known to men like Voldemort that allows them to manipulate the minds of others. I will not explain such things here, but I think with the threat of Voldemort reemerging once more, it is important for you especially to learn this fine art.\" His eyes began to twinkle once more. \"It also provides a number of other benefits that are most useful if properly applied. I will warn you though, these benefits are nastily tricky to learn.\"

The choice was a foregone conclusion. Just like when Theodore had told him about obliviators, Harry\'s imagination ran through all the horrid things he didn\'t want somebody to be able to do to his mind. If there was a defence of any kind, he would be learning it.

\"I\'ll learn it, sir.\"

\"Excellent!\" Dumbledore glanced at a clock on the wall. \"I do believe I have overstayed my welcome, unless you have any final questions?\"

\"Um... a couple?\"

\"Ask away, then.\"

\"Do you know who sent me the invisibility cloak?\"

\"Ah --- your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it. They are such useful things... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\"

\"And there\'s something else...\"

\"Fire away.\"

\"Can I stay at Hogwarts over the summer holidays?\"

Dumbledore\'s face fell. \"I am afraid not, Harry. Much as I do not believe them to have treated you with the kindness you deserve, the Dursleys are your family. Perhaps that is another mistake I have made over the years. I was the one who allowed them to obtain guardianship over you in the first place. I can only say that at the time, I had genuinely believed they would treat you with the utmost kindness. Alas, the deed is done and undoing it would be a great deal of trouble for all involved. Yet no matter what, you are safe there; more safe than anywhere else in the world. Powerful magics are in place on that home. Magics that draw directly from the power of your mother\'s sacrifice. So long as you reside there, no outsider who means you harm can lay so much as a finger on you.\"

Harry had to try hard not to let the anger, bitterness, and frustration show on his face. So it had been Dumbledore who had gotten him stuck there. \"I understand, sir,\" he said in a bland voice that came out a touch cooler than intended.

If Dumbledore noticed, he made no comment. \"Very good. Now, how about you begin on the mountain of sweets your friends have left for you, hm?\" He reached out and picked up a package of Bettie Botts Every Flavour Beans. \"Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit-flavoured one, and since then I\'m afraid I\'ve rather lost my liking for them --- but I think I\'ll be safe with a nice toffee, don\'t you?\"

He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, \"Alas! Earwax!\"

***June 19, 1992***

***The Great Hall***

***1:00 PM***

It had been nearly two days before Harry had been allowed out of the hospital wing. He had lightly protested, but he actually hadn\'t minded that much. His books had been brought to him so he could at least read. Not for too long, or his head would begin to ache --- but it was a nice distraction. More than anything though, he had wanted to spend time alone.

He needed time to process all that had happened. The revelation that Voldemort had not only survived but was threatening a return, the death of a fellow student despite his intervention, and all the other things that had transpired since his last bout of consciousness.

That wasn\'t to say he was alone.

His friends were allowed to visit him the day after he awoke. Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy, and Theodore poured in alongside Diana, Cassius, and the rest of their friends.

There had been an awkward moment during which Harry and Draco had stared intently at one another before the blond finally broke.

\"I was an idiot, all right? I should have never done it. You told me not to and I gave you my word. I\'m not sorry I did it, but I\'m sorry I did it without telling you. I should have at least been honest and said what I was doing. I\'m sorry, Harry. I hope we can be friends again and that I can earn back your trust. I promise, I won\'t lie to you again.\"

Slowly, Harry nodded.

Things had been tense between Harry and Draco for the next few days, but they had mostly smoothed over. Harry didn\'t trust Draco nearly as much as he had before the incident, but then again, he wasn\'t sure he trusted *anyone* nearly as much as he once had. This year had left a deep and lasting impression on him. Draco was just more directly under his line of scrutiny than most because of what had already transpired between them.

The day before the train was set to bring them all back to London, the leaving feast was held in the Great Hall.

When they entered, it was clear there was more at play and Harry had very little doubt of what that was.

The hall was decorated in Gryffindor colours despite Slytherin\'s House Cup victory. The decorations were muted though. Dark, tasteful reds as opposed to vivid scarlets. Any gold that was used was done so very sparingly.

The school had of course been made aware of Neville\'s passing, if not the specific details that had accompanied it. As always, the Hogwarts rumour mill had been running roughshod. Most had linked his death to Quirrell\'s sudden disappearance. Some had even gone as far as to group Harry in somehow since he had spent a number of days in the hospital wing directly after the fact.

The mood of the school had been heavy, though there had been a brief break in that mood when --- on the back of their captain, Oliver Wood, and their star seeker, Ron Weasley --- Gryffindor captured their first Quidditch Cup in seven years. Weasley had, according to some, almost not been medically cleared to play, but he had persevered and beaten the young Ravenclaw seeker to the snitch.

It had served as an apt tribute to Gryffindor\'s fallen hero, though the mood in the hall was heavy in spite of that.

The hall was deathly silent even before Dumbledore took to his feet at the staff table, but he still waited a moment before speaking.

\"Another year gone,\" he began. \"Though this was no ordinary year. As you will all by now be aware, we lost one of our own in the closing weeks of this otherwise magical year.\" His eyes roamed the hall and fell on the Gryffindor table, where there were plenty of muted expressions and downcast faces.

\"Neville Longbottom was a boy who personified everything it means to be a Gryffindor. Godric himself would have felt great pride at having young Neville in his house. This was not publicised at the time, but I think it only right now to give the son of Franklin and Alice his credit for he, like them, was a hero.

\"It was Neville who disposed of the troll on Halloween when it invaded our castle.\" Muttering erupted through the Great Hall at this, ranging from awed to disbelieving. \"He did so at great personal risk and with the safety of his friends in mind. He was undoubtedly brave and stunningly kind. He put his friends before himself until the very end. He chose to do what was right instead of what was easy and for that, he will be fondly remembered by all.

\"In dark times like these, I think it only prudent we learn all we can, for it is best to make light of any and all situations. Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, so long as one remembers to follow the light. Whether you knew Neville or not, I urge all of you to take the time and effort to hold each other up. Use this as an opportunity to unite together and grow stronger. Do not allow his loss to weaken your resolve or your friendships; it is the opposite of what a boy like Neville would have wanted.

\"Before we move onto the awarding of the House Cup, I think it only right we stand and take a moment of silence for a boy who was good, kind, and brave.\" All in the hall stood, glasses in hand as they followed the lead of their Headmaster. \"To Neville Longbottom,\" Dumbledore thundered, and the students chorused back. Even the Slytherins chanted along, and Harry did not see even a single person sitting down.

\"Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six, and Slytherin have four hundred and seventy-two.\"

A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Had it not been for the mood befallen on Harry by the rousing speech about Neville, he would have joined Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle in banging their goblets against the table whilst the rest of the house stomped and cheered.

\"Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent events must be taken into account.\"

The room went very still and the Slytherins\' smiles faded a little.

\"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes... First --- to Master Ronald Weasley, for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"

Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to shake quiver. From across the hall, Harry could see Ron Weasley\'s multitude of brothers dogpiling on top of him as if he had just won them the Quidditch Cup for a second time that month.

\"Idiots,\" hissed Draco. \"It\'s not like those points matter.\"

Dumbledore cleared his throat and the hall fell silent once again. \"Second --- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"

Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves --- they were a hundred points up, even if they were still sixty points behind Slytherin.

\"Third --- to Master Harry Potter...\" said Dumbledore. The room went deathly quiet as the Slytherins\' ears perked up. \"For pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Slytherin house sixty points.\"

The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Slytherin now had five hundred and thirty-two points --- once more ahead of the lions by over a hundred points.

A hundred and twenty, to be exact.

Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.

\"To Master Neville Longbottom, for the ultimate form of bravery that can never be measured and will never be forgotten, I award Gryffindor house one hundred and twenty-five points.\"

Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table.

Slytherins up and down were cursing at the top of their lungs, but Harry could hear none of them over the eruption of noise from the other three tables. He felt the pang of anger in his stomach like the rest of his house, but he found himself not nearly as upset as his companions.

He knew all too well what Neville had sacrificed trying to stop Voldemort. Even if he still wasn\'t sure what he thought of the objective, that kind of bravery deserved far more than a house championship trophy. Losing the House Cup stung and Harry did feel quite cheated, but he could at least understand why Dumbledore had done it --- even if he may not have liked the decision.

\"Which means,\" Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we need no change of decoration.\"

And so the feast itself began.

When it finished sometime later, many of the Slytherins were muttering harshly as they exited the hall. Harry stayed quiet, not so much as looking up until a hand rested on his shoulder.

\"Headmaster?\"

\"I do apologize for the loss in the standings,\" said Dumbledore. \"You really did deserve more points than I awarded you, but I thought a Gryffindor victory more... thematically appropriate.\"

Harry\'s expression didn\'t change. \"I understand, sir.\"

\"Very good. I do hope you enjoy your summer.\"

***June 20, 1992***

***The Hogwarts Express***

***11:23 AM***

It had been a rough few weeks for Ron and Hermione, who now sat alone in a compartment on the Hogwarts Express as the train raced back towards London.

Losing Neville had been very hard on the both of them. Ron was quite popular, especially after the win he had secured Gryffindor in the Quidditch final, but most of the people who followed him around didn\'t really captivate his attention. He enjoyed the attention and happily basked in it, but he wouldn\'t really call any of those people friends.

Hermione didn\'t have many, either. Her bookish nature turned most people off of her, so she treasured the few friends she did have.

Neville had defined what it had meant to be a friend. The boy had begun to come out of his shell as the year had drawn on, and both Ron and Hermione had been glad for it. He was the kindest of all of them and Hermione couldn\'t help but remember the way he had stood between her and the figure in the forest, or the resolute expression he had worn before they departed for the final time down in the catacombs on that fateful night.

Even now, more than two weeks later, both of them were sombre as the train departed from Hogsmeade Station. They didn\'t speak for twenty long minutes.

Not until a knock came from the door and it opened to reveal a tall, handsome boy the two of them recognized as a Hufflepuff. Two younger girls followed in his wake. One had blonde pigtails whilst the other had dark red hair pulled back in a loose ponytail.

\"Hi,\" said the older boy, who was clearly the ringleader. \"Can we sit here?\"

Ron and Hermione exchanged glances before hesitantly nodding.

\"Thank you,\" said the boy, levitating all of their trunks up and into the overhead compartment with well-practised precision. \"I\'m sorry for your loss; I know you two were closest with Neville. I didn\'t know him well, but he was always kind to me and he was a great model of exactly what Gryffindor should be. I wish I could have known him, but I\'m hoping I can get to know those he called friends. If he thought you two were worth hanging around with, then I\'m sure we\'ll get along fine, if you\'ll let us.\"

He held out his hand, first to Hermione. \"I\'m Cedric Diggory. This is Hannah Abbot and Susan Bones. I hope we can become good friends in the future.\"

Ron and Hermione couldn\'t help but smile. There was just something about Cedric Diggory that spoke of a potentially happy future.

***About ten hours later...***

Harry had spent most of the train ride back to London in silence while his friends discussed a wide number of things and played games of all sorts.

He didn\'t even read; he just stared out of the window, watching the lush green fields and quaint little towns race past as they sped down the tracks for hours and hours.

There was nothing he dreaded more than returning to Privet Drive and his anxiety was higher than it had ever been before. It had only gotten worse when, before leaving the feast, they had all been given a reminder that magic was not to be performed out of school unless they were of age. Harry had known this already, but seeing the reminder in his hand really drove the point home.

He would be at the mercy of the Dursleys once more and forced to live like a common muggle for the next two and a half months.

\"Don\'t worry,\" Draco had told him. \"I\'m sure Father will get you out of that dump quickly enough. He\'ll need to confirm some things, of course, but I\'m sure he\'ll have no trouble... convincing the muggles to let you out.\"

Draco\'s words hadn\'t reassured Harry as much as the blond had likely hoped, but he was grateful for them nonetheless.

By the time the door to their compartment slid open just minutes before they were set to arrive at King\'s Cross Station, Harry\'s heart was beating unnaturally fast.

\"Your end-of-year grades,\" said Gemma, who had stepped through the door to deliver their missives. She levitated the envelopes to each of them, but her stare didn\'t leave Harry. \"Can you come with me for a moment, Potter?\"

\"Um... sure.\"

Harry stood and followed her out of the compartment, opening his envelope and peering down at the parchment within as he did so.

*Dear Master Potter,*

*Please find enclosed your end-of-year results. We thank you for your dedication this year and would like to sincerely congratulate you on all of your achievements.*

*Yours truly,*

*Minerva McGonagall*

*Deputy Headmistress*

*Passing Grades:*

*O = Outstanding.*

*E = Exceeds Expectations.*

*A = Acceptable.*

*Failing Grades:*

*P = Poor.*

*D = Dreadful.*

*T = Troll.*

*Harry James Potter Has Achieved:*

*Astronomy - A*

*Charms - O*

*Defence Against the Dark Arts - O*

*Herbology - E*

*History of Magic - O*

*Potions - E*

*Transfiguration - O*

Harry internally thanked Professor Flitwick for what must have been the hundredth time for making him see the importance of magical theory. He was gifted enough in Transfiguration and Defence Against the Dark Arts that it honestly might not have mattered. In Charms though, he would never have scored an O without the dedication to theoretical material. He was very good at Charms, but Flitwick\'s class had a *heavy* emphasis on magic\'s theoretical components.

His Astronomy grade was low, but he cared not at all for the class. As far as he could tell, its only applications were in knowing when certain potions ingredients were at their most optimal. He doubted he would ever be a master potioneer and if he somehow ever became one, he would be using a star chart anyway. He viewed the class as being useless and couldn\'t wait to drop it entirely after fifth year.

Herbology was useful, but it had never been of great interest to Harry. The same could be said for Potions. History was really just a joke. Harry spent most of the class studying magical theory while Binns droned on and on in the background. Harry had just read thoroughly through the relevant portions of the history textbook. He had actually read through much more than that since he genuinely did find the subject interesting when Binns wasn\'t teaching.

Next year, he thought, he would just stop attending History lessons and see if anyone of importance even noticed. He would still get an O; of that, he had little doubt.

Gemma cleared her throat, drawing Harry\'s attention back onto her. \"I won\'t be seeing you next year,\" she said. \"Not with me going off into the world and you going back to Hogwarts. I wanted you to know that you were a pleasure to teach and that you have the potential to be special.\" Her eyes gleamed. \"I\'m not the only one to see it, either. Other people see it in you, Harry. When you meet them, I think you should listen to what they have to say.\"

Harry wasn\'t entirely sure what she meant by that, but he nodded along anyway as Gemma removed yet another envelope from the pocket of her robes.

\"Something to remember me by.\"

Harry reached out and took the envelope, immediately feeling as though something was wrong. It seemed to... tingle under his fingertips.

\"Ziel erreicht!\"

Gemma Fawley\'s barking proclamation was the last thing Harry heard before the oddest sensation gripped him.

It was as though a hook had attached itself right underneath his navel and was pulling him forward at break-neck speeds. The world blurred around him as distorted colours and shapes raced past faster than the eye could perceive. He was spinning like a top, faster and faster as he travelled through space and time so quickly he was sure he would explode at any moment...

But he didn\'t.

Harry\'s feet slammed hard into something solid, sending him sprawling.

He didn\'t know where he was, but he knew it was not the Hogwarts Express.

The air in this place was different. Drafts of wind seemed to whistle through its halls as if the space within was open and vast. Harry glanced up but it was dark. There were no windows facing him and even if there were, it was night outside. The only light came from a scarce number of dim torches hanging in ancient-looking brackets dotted conservatively on the walls.

This place reminded Harry of a dungeon; though he had the distinct impression that, wherever he was, it was at least above ground.

Then, he saw the bodies.

There were three of them lying nearby and for a moment, he thought they had been deposited here like him.

He crawled towards the nearest one and reached out to shake his shoulder, keen on asking if any of them knew what the hell was happening.

It became immediately clear none of these men knew anything now.

When Harry got closer, the gruesome sight laid out before him made itself known. It was only all the more nightmarish by the fact the bodies were cast in shadow, and the red pools around their heads were only visible at all because they were just barely illuminated by the flickering torchlight.

Harry wanted to gag.

Not even the smell of Quirrell\'s burning flesh or the feeling of his fingers tearing through his eyes like a child\'s might rip through bubble wrap had given him this sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach. He hadn\'t eaten all day out of stress but still, the very acid of his stomach threatened to rise at the horror scene he was now a witness to.

All three bodies were prone as if asleep, but the truth was much, much worse.

Their heads had all been twisted so far their necks had not just broken, but the top of their spines had pierced their very throats. The bone could be seen jutting up and out of their skin like skewers through kebabs. One of the heads had been inverted a full one hundred and eighty degrees, and the top of his spine stuck straight up and pierced through his jaw like a morbid caricature of a tongue, exposing that bone and muscle as well.

It was like something out of a horror movie, and it made anything Voldemort had done this year at Hogwarts seem tame by comparison.

Only a monster could do something like this. It would have made Jack the Ripper proud and whoever was responsible was surely the magical equivalent of him --- or even worse.

\"We meet at last.\"

The voice came from the shadows behind Harry, where he had yet to look as he was so transfixed with horror by the scene that had greeted him.

The voice was accented. Harry was no expert but to him, it sounded vaguely German. It was soft, smooth, and amused of all things.

It was *amused* by all of this!

Harry did not stand. He couldn\'t, for he knew his shaking legs would have given out beneath him from fear, nausea, and horror.

But he did turn himself around and look into the shadows from where the voice spoke.

Between him and it was a set of bars so close together that not even a skeleton could have fit through them. It was difficult to see inside the cell, but Harry thought he could make out the vaguest outline of a bed near a window that overlooked a dark, churning body of water far below.

And there was a figure on the bed... a shadowy figure that was standing and moving towards him.

Harry tried to get to his feet, but couldn\'t. His legs gave out, just as he knew they would, and he was left to stare in transfixed terror at the man approaching him.

Just as he neared the bars, the man held out his hand and in it, light burst into being, casting his weathered face into sharp relief.

He had the look of a very handsome man who had not aged well. His face was thin and gaunt, but Harry could see where it had once doubtlessly been chiselled and youthful. The man was mostly bald, but there were a few wisps of white hair remaining, dotted haphazardly upon his skull; with skin stretched so tight that his head resembled that of a fleshless skeleton.

Except for the eyes.

His eyes shone with so much intelligence that Harry immediately knew this man had orchestrated all of it. From inside his very prison cell, he had somehow orchestrated the death of these guards and probably even Harry\'s arrival.

\"A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mister Potter, and welcome to Nurmengard,\" the man said in that smooth, accented voice, his eyes dancing with unmasked hunger. \"I am Gellert Grindelwald, and the two of us have much to discuss.\"

**TO BE CONTINUED IN**

**BOOK 2:**

**HARRY POTTER AND THE EROSION OF INNOCENCE**

**COMING OCTOBER 3RD, 2021!**

**Author\'s Endnote:**

**A note on the release date for book 2:**

**I do apologize for the delay, but I am writing the entirety of book 2 before I post a single word of it on FFN or AO3. I also hope to compete in Tokyo this summer, so that will hopefully occupy much of my time as well. With these two things to consider, I hope you will forgive the absence.**

**It will start uploading earlier than that on my Discord server. If you want to get book 2 a little bit early and haven\'t joined that yet, I would recommend doing so. There are more than 2,000 people on there to chat with while you\'re at it, and I myself am quite active.**

**For those of you reading on FFN, the link can be found on my profile. If it doesn\'t work for you the first time, try updating your browser and it should work fine. If not, you can always shoot me a PM and I can help get you sorted. If you\'re reading this on AO3, just click the Discord link in the chapter notes at the top. It should take you right there.**

**About half of book 2 is already written and is available RIGHT NOW for those who sign up to my P\*T\*E\*N page. You are under no obligation to do so, but the option is there if you want the chapters immediately. I believe there are twelve unreleased chapters up on there, at the moment.**

**Also, book 2 and all future books will be posted under this one story. They will not be posted as separate stories, so you just need to stay following this story to keep up to date on the fic.**

**Now, onto the actual chapter notes:**

**First year is a difficult one to make interesting, largely because it always seems to end in the same way. I have obviously not done that, so I hope you found the first year --- its final few chapters, in particular --- to be both unique and entertaining.**

**On the note of first year, a massive thank you to those of you who consistently review. I read each and every single one of them and they mean the world to me. A special shoutout is extended to The Tale of Fate for leaving an extremely well thought out and very insightful review on the last chapter. I would really have loved to discuss it with you, but your profile does not allow me to send messages. Just know that it has been read, considered, and appreciated.**

**Oh, and before any reviews come up about it, I promise there is an explanation for Harry being transported to Nurmengard and it is consistent with Grindelwald being unable to escape. It is explained in book 2\'s first chapter. :)**

**Speaking of shoutouts, I can take almost no credit for any of the cerberus lore. That was an idea had by my beta, Regress, and it is one of the cooler magical theory concepts I have heard in quite some time.**

**As I said, we will be diverging further and further from canon as the story progresses, so I hope you enjoyed its opening instalments.**

**My advice to those reading on is simple.**

**Expect the unexpected.**

**Please read and review.**

**Book 2: The Erosion of Innocence**

**Chapter 1: Decisions and Dreams**

***July 3, 1992***

***No. 4 Privet Drive***

***9:34 PM***

The summer had been stiflingly hot on Privet Drive. One of the more brutal months of July that any could remember was well and truly underway; the relentless sun seemed to attempt to scorch all mortals subjected to its almighty light.

Even the evening offered little reprieve.

It was one of the first Friday nights of the summer. The sun had set, yet still, the heat was unbearable. It was a thick, humid heat that made breathing a task in and of itself. As the natural light waned, the air only seemed to thicken, growing denser in unison with the ever-present population of bugs which were a whole different kind of menace all on their own.

Not that the small, bespectacled youth sitting in the smallest bedroom in one of the startlingly uniform houses on this street would have known any of this.

He sat on the edge of a battered old cot and stared vacantly out of the open window. His eyes were naturally attracted to the nearest streetlight, but they weren't really seeing it. They weren't seeing much of anything, for this boy's mind was firmly on things that he considered far more consequential than the blisteringly hot air outside.

Not that he had gotten to experience the outdoors at all that summer.

Despite the horrific expedition that he had experienced after being plucked straight from the Hogwarts Express, Harry Potter had made it back onto Platform Nine and Three-Quarters intact. He had done so while violently shaking and doing his best not to vomit at the memory of the mutilated bodies he had seen, but he had arrived back nonetheless.

No sooner than he had arrived --- in perfect unison with the train, he might add --- he had been approached and escorted back through the barrier by the Malfoy family. Lucius's conversation with Uncle Vernon had been interesting. The man had told his uncle that if Harry wrote him or his children with any complaints of mistreatment, Lucius himself would be arriving at Privet Drive and the Dursleys would have hell to pay.

This unfortunately accomplished the exact opposite of what Lucius had intended.

The Dursleys had treated Harry surprisingly well that first night. He had eaten a quiet dinner with the family and been given more food than he could ever remember eating before. He hadn't even been forced to make it, which --- before being given his own bedroom after Hagrid's shocking arrival last summer --- would have been a first in its own right.

It hadn't been until the next morning that Harry realized exactly what had happened.

He would like to think that normally he would have been more than perceptive enough to realize exactly what was going on with the Dursley family. He thought that maybe he would have even gleaned their intentions in a manner similar to how he had gleaned Draco's regarding Hagrid and the dragon, even if he had ignored them at the time.

The problem was, nothing about his psyche on that night had been normal.

Only weeks earlier, Harry Potter had come face-to-face with his parents' murderer; a man who also just so happened to be the most feared dark lord the British Isles had ever seen --- Lord Voldemort.

Voldemort had completely shattered Harry's worldview in the span of a single conversation and forced him to rethink everything he thought he had known. He had forced him to consider things that just seemed quintessential when discussing the magical world; things that Harry had never considered before.

And those considerations had led to groundbreaking and mildly disturbing revelations for Harry that he wasn't entirely sure how to feel about.

But that hadn't been enough for Voldemort.

The reason they had come face-to-face in the first place was because the Dark Lord had been attempting to steal the Philosopher's Stone from Hogwarts; an artifact so powerful that it could have restored him to his old powers.

The problem for Voldemort was that the stone had been under the protection of Albus Dumbledore --- a man many considered to be the greatest wizard of modern times. A weakened Voldemort was confronted by the Headmaster before he could make off with his spoils, forcing him to hold a student, Neville Longbottom, hostage.

That confrontation had ended with Harry making a poor and brash decision.

He was confident at the time that Voldemort had been suitably distracted by Dumbledore, so he had taken his opportunity to strike. Not necessarily because he disagreed with the man's ideologies. Much of what he had said rang more true with Harry than he would likely ever admit aloud. His goals weren't the problem so much as his methods. Holding a child hostage was something Harry had fundamental problems with. He had felt like a hostage for much of his life, so he had a hard time just letting Voldemort kill an innocent eleven-year-old boy and permanently scar yet another family.

Yet his decision had led to the very thing he had hoped to prevent.

Harry had vanquished Voldemort once more through the use of a miraculous sort of power he hadn't known was at his disposal.

Unfortunately, the Dark Lord had not gone down peacefully.

He had immediately and gruesomely murdered Neville Longbottom as soon as Harry had struck him. So in the end, Harry had felt as though he'd come off as the loser in that particular confrontation.

One would reasonably assume that had been the most harrowing thing that had happened to eleven-year-old Harry Potter that month, but they would inexplicably be mistaken.

On the train ride back to London, he had been lured into a trap by Gemma Fawley --- the then Hogwarts Head Girl who befriended him months earlier. She had given him what he later realized was a portkey.

A portkey that had taken him straight to a place that had since haunted his nightmares.

If landing in a dark, mysterious place with no idea where you were or why you were there in the first place hadn't been enough, the sight of three corpses with horribly contorted necks and spines protruding up through their skin like kebab skewers had certainly done it.

If that hadn't, the sight and sounds of Gellert Grindelwald's introduction certainly had.

***The Past***

***June 20, 1992***

***Nurmengard Prison***

***9:41 PM***

Harry lay on the stone floor, immobilized by terror, as he stared in shocked horror at the second dark lord with whom he had crossed paths with in the past three weeks.

Voldemort had been terrifying. Harry had spent the better part of a year being taught to fear the man's very name. He had heard tales of the Dark Lord's power at the height of his reign. He had heard of how he'd very nearly subjugated Magical Britain under his rule, despite Dumbledore's opposition, and he had seen first hand what the man was capable of. Even when *weakened* and *desperate.*

But Gellert Grindelwald terrified him in an entirely different way.

He was an unknown. Harry knew that he had once sought to ravage Europe. The man's reign of terror had centred on matters pertaining to the Statute of Secrecy, if he remembered correctly. And his newfound feelings --- which Voldemort had incited --- complicated his views on that.

It was natural to fear the unknown, but this exact unknown had made him painfully aware of exactly how dangerous it really was.

Grindelwald had managed to orchestrate Harry's elaborate kidnapping despite the fact he had been trapped in his own prison for the past forty-seven years. Not to mention the dead and disfigured corpses whom Harry assumed to be guards.

This was all far too much.

He tried to stand but for a third time, his legs failed him.

"It would do you no good," said Grindelwald. "I lurk behind these bars because of my own prowess. This prison is inescapable for even I. Whilst this cell confines me, I cannot escape, and those on the outside are as incapable of reaching me as I am them." His lips twisted upwards. "Unfortunate though it may be that it is of no assistance in freeing me, the fact remains that the wards of this prison answer only to me. Do not run, Harry Potter. You would not get far."

"Wha... why am I here?"

Harry's voice nearly cracked even while speaking that one sentence. He was almost beyond being terrified now. The initial, nauseating horror that had gripped him had since begun to ebb away, only to be replaced by a hollow feeling of dread and numbness; an odd combination, to be certain.

Grindelwald's lips curved upwards into a smile. "You are here because the songs of prophecy sung to me a most beautiful melody. One I could not possibly ignore in good conscience."

"I don't---"

"They sang for you, Harry Potter. They sang of the famed Boy-Who-Lived and of all he could become. They sang of exactly what could happen if he was guided in the right direction, and they sang of victory for a noble cause which I have long believed as dead as many who once opposed it."

Harry finally stood unsteadily to his feet. "I don't get it," he admitted. "I d-don't understand."

Grindelwald studied him very intently, bluish-silver eyes flickering maliciously in the conjured light he held in his palm. The light seemed to dance across their surface like it might be a sheet of ice, but no natural creation should be able to sparkle with such cunning and malevolence.

"No," he mused, "I suppose you do not." He took a long moment of pause. "What do you think of muggles, Harry Potter?"

The question caught him off guard and Harry's initial impulse was to not answer it. Then he remembered what Grindelwald had said about the wards. There was of course the possibility he had been bluffing, but Harry somehow didn't think so. He doubted a man capable of making this meeting happen despite their circumstances needed to bluff.

Hell, he wondered if Grindelwald already knew the answer to his question.

He remembered speaking with Dumbledore in the hospital wing following the confrontation with Voldemort. He thought back to what the man had said about magics which could read and alter one's thoughts, and he shuddered. His knowledge of Grindelwald may have been scarce, but one as powerful as the one-time dark lord would surely know of such magics. Harry would not be surprised in the slightest to learn that the now emaciated prisoner standing before him was a master practitioner of the art.

"I... I---"

"You hate them."

"I... don't know if---"

"You might not yet realize it, but you do. I have seen your past, child. I know how you were raised and I have seen the atrocities committed to your detriment. You understand their nature. They seek to destroy what they cannot control. I doubt I need to enlighten you as to what that means for our kind?"

It was an eerily similar message to the one Voldemort had preached weeks earlier, though Harry still didn't understand why this maniac had gone through all the effort of kidnapping him just to rant about the same rhetoric that had landed him here in the first place.

"Do you not agree?" Grindelwald pressed.

Harry didn't trust himself to speak. Despite the numb feeling, he could still feel bile in the back of his throat and his capacity for rational thought was rather limited at the moment. He realized by now that lying to Grindelwald was an exercise in futility, so he just shook his head.

"And that is why you are here. You harbour many beliefs I previously championed. You have the potential to be great, though it is potential that may well be squandered. Surely you have already realized many of the systemic problems our world suffers from? Many of these are exactly why you will never realize your power simply by following conventional methodologies."

"I still don't know what you want from me," Harry finally managed to force out.

"I want you to open your eyes. You agree with me on everything I have said and we both know it. Yet I do not think you would act on such feelings. You are still young and naive, and you still hold certain compunctions highly. These compunctions serve you no purpose. All they do is make you weak.

"I will not ask you to join me or to soldier my cause because I already know it is the one you will choose in time. All I am asking is that you open your mind. Examine the world around you honestly and without these compunctions. Observe everything about it that is wrong and comprise a mental list of everything that should change. Think of what will happen when the muggles inevitably find us."

"So you want to kill all of the muggleborns like Voldemort? That way, you destroy the links between our worlds?"

Grindelwald scowled. "I would never wish such a thing. Deliberately spilling magical blood of any kind is a crime in and of itself. It is the highest level of treason to our most beautiful world. Why destroy something when you can control it? Add my war to your list of investigations. Look past the propaganda which is doubtlessly perpetuated all over the world and look into the truths."

Grindelwald smiled a wicked smile. "And of course, ask any questions you may have along the way. I am no monster; simply a pragmatist who wishes the best for the magical world. If you follow my instructions and keep an open and honest mind, you will come to realize this in time."

"How am I supposed to look into all of this when I'm trapped here?"

"Trapped? Oh, dear boy, you will not be here much longer. That will cease to be the case in a matter of moments."

"You're... letting me go?"

"I have told you, I am no monster. I do not seek to harm those of magic. I am a visionary who sees what will become of the world if action is not taken. And even if I am wrong, what does it matter? We have power the muggles do not and suffer from very little of what ails them. We are superior; it is our right to rule them."

Harry said nothing. This was all far too much. First Voldemort and now Grindelwald. What was it with mass-murdering dark lords and their apparent penchant for spouting philosophy?

And why couldn't he find it in himself to disagree with them? Why did so many words spoken by two of the evilest and vilest humans to ever exist resonate with him so strongly? What did that say about him? Surely, it made him just as bad as the monsters he spoke with?

Yet Grindelwald said he was no monster and the points he made were as valid as Voldemort's. Why should the muggles be allowed to rule the world? Why were the wizards forced to hide while their clearly inferior counterparts moved freely in broad daylight? Why was it that the magicals lived in fear?

Was it wrong that Harry was thinking all of this?

And, most importantly, why was he lost so deeply in philosophical ideologies when he really ought to consider the problem which stood before him?

Harry saw one major flaw in what Grindelwald had just said, and it actually had nothing to do with his ideology. If he was released, nothing was stopping the Boy-Who-Lived from running off to either Professor Dumbledore or the authorities about this whole thing...

"Ah, so that is why you are skeptical." Grindelwald smiled thinly. "You will be telling no tales, I am afraid."

If Harry was any less shaken, he might have gasped or screamed at having his thoughts so casually read. It still felt like a horrible violation he could hardly tolerate, but his mind was plagued so deeply by other things, it somehow seemed minor in comparison.

"What is there to stop me?"

"Only an enchantment." Grindelwald held up the hand not holding aloft the magical light and something levitated from off of his cot. It was a chain, of sorts; its pendant emblazoned with an odd, triangular symbol that Harry had never seen before. "This portkey will take you out of Nurmengard and place you precisely back on the platform you were set to arrive on. By touching this pendant, you will be activating a binding magical contract forbidding you from telling any of this incident or any other involving myself without my express permission. This contract will even protect said information from slip-ups or psychic attacks."

That was simultaneously the most terrifying and ingenious thing Harry had ever heard. The wonders of magic never failed to amaze him. Whenever he thought he had grown accustomed to this world, something else would make itself known to him and make him feel like he had that first day when wandering into Diagon Alley.

Then again, this was Gellert Grindelwald. No matter what anyone thought of the man, no historian had ever contested the fact that he was one of the most brilliant magicians to walk the earth.

The choice was easy. Not being able to tell anyone about this paled in comparison to the far less desirable alternative. Especially considering that Harry wasn't even sure if he would have told anyone anyway. Most would have thought him insane and, once more, he just... had no real reason to tell anyone. What were they going to do if Grindelwald could control the wards? And honestly, did Harry even want them to do anything?

"So you brought me all the way here just to lecture me and then let me go?"

Grindelwald laughed for the first time. The gesture wracked his body and sent him into a violent fit of coughing, but he recovered quickly enough. "You think much too small, child. I am giving you an artifact you already know is enchanted, am I not? I have also asked you to ask me any questions at a later date. Do try to put the pieces together."

Harry's brow furrowed. "It's a... communication device? It will somehow let me ask you stuff on top of making sure I can't tell anyone about this?"

"Overly simplistic, but not incorrect. Simply think of this place and a desire to return before closing your eyes for the final time in a day. That will allow you to ask me anything you could ever wish, and I shall *always* answer.

"I brought you here not for a singular lecture, but to allow you to digest all I have said and establish an open line of communication. Your potential is limitless and I think you may further my ideals one day. It is in my best interests to further *you* as much as I can. Any questions you may have about what has been spoken on today may be asked alongside questions of any other variety. I am quite possibly the greatest magician the world has ever seen. I know you are a curious and ambitious child. There is much I could teach you that no one else could."

Harry didn't answer. That made far more sense. It was actually wise and he didn't feel nearly as opposed to the idea as he knew he ought to. He feared Grindelwald; there was no denying that, but did he hate him? Not on a personal level, at least. In terms of what the man had done, Harry only knew vague details from *The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts*. That war hadn't been covered in History of Magic and Harry hadn't put a great deal of research into the topic.

There was also the fact that Grindelwald was undoubtedly right about his final point.

Harry had enjoyed his pseudo-lessons with Gemma Fawley because they had allowed him to work ahead of the curriculum and learn a great many things he wouldn't have otherwise. Ever since Professor Flitwick had confronted him in the library all those months ago about magical theory, he had taken an intense interest in all things magic --- except Astronomy, which Harry still considered to be completely useless.

If he had come so far in a few months with the tutelage of Gemma Fawley, he could not possibly imagine how far he could come under the guidance of Gellert Grindelwald.

Yet he knew it was wrong.

Conceptually, fundamentally, it was wrong. He should never allow a dark lord any influence over him, nor should he take instruction from one.

But Merlin... what he could achieve.

"I know you will not use it," said Grindelwald. "Well, you will, but not right away. That will come in time. How much time, we shall have to wait and see. I do not expect you to immediately adopt my ideologies and philosophies. I would be disappointed if you were so easily swayed. All I ask is that you look at things from different perspectives and cease lying to yourself before years of doing so conditions you in a less than ideal way.

"For now, rest your mind and digest all you have taken in here today. When you wish to speak, I shall be waiting."

The chain and its pendant floated between the bars of Grindelwald's cell and hovered tantalizingly close to Harry. He felt his knees begin to shake once more as the reality of leaving this place became apparent to him.

Shaking and without a glance in the former dark lord's direction, Harry reached out and touched the pendant.

Along with the familiar jerk at his navel, he also felt... something deeper within him. Something that only confirmed the existence of the contract that Grindelwald had spoken of, and something that solidified beyond all else that this had indeed not been a dream.

***Back in the present...***

Harry's mind was still reeling from all of that when he had arrived back on the platform and put in a surprisingly successful attempt at not vomiting all over the place. He appeared just as the train had pulled in. The Malfoys came immediately after and escorted him back through the barrier.

Perhaps if all of that hadn't taken place, he might have realized that the Dursleys' kindness had simply been them luring him into a false sense of security.

He had woken up that next morning to find all of his possessions gone and a completely barren room except for the cot he had slept on. He had bolted to the door and pulled on the handle, but it hadn't budged. His uncle had clearly locked it from the outside and Harry's window was locked from the other side as well. It was a small mercy he'd let Hedwig out to hunt the night before. At least she wouldn't be trapped here with him.

It hadn't taken him long to realize that Lord Malfoy's threats had actually scared the Dursleys *too* much. They were unwilling to even allow Harry the opportunity of writing to the man and they had apparently viewed the best way of circumventing that possibility to be removing all of Harry's things from his possession and locking him in his room.

Their method was annoyingly successful.

He couldn't write to anyone, nor could he even receive letters --- not that it mattered. He hadn't seen a single owl soaring near his window; which hurt him more than he cared to admit.

Perhaps Draco hadn't been quite as forgiving of Harry's cold shoulder as the Boy-Who-Lived had believed. He had expected letters from the likes of Pansy, Cassius, and Diana. Possibly Theodore as well. He was harder to read and sometimes, Harry wondered how much he actually liked him versus how useful he found him. He had stuck with Harry through his spat with Draco though, which was a point in his favour. He hadn't expected any mail from Crabbe or Goyle; it would have been remarkably out of character for either of them.

He just lounged around his room all day and tried not to die from boredom while living off the measly amounts of food and water shoved through his prison's cat flap three times a day.

After nearly two weeks of this hellacious torture, Harry finally thought he had snapped as he looked out over Privet Drive.

His mind couldn't even fixate on a singular topic anymore. It jumped around from thought to thought without a care for clarity nor consistency. Only a scarce few thoughts repeatedly occupied Harry's mind nowadays --- none of them were cheerful.

The first, and most pressing, was his overwhelming desire to escape this place by any means necessary. The problem was that his wand had been taken along with his other things. He had hidden it under his pillow, but whoever had raided his room had apparently found it.

The next two thoughts were linked in a dark sort of way that made Harry seriously reconsider many things about himself.

The first was that he hated the Dursleys more than any beings who walked the face of the earth. He hated them more than words could express and if he had the means, he wasn't at all sure he wouldn't have killed them given the slightest opportunity in that moment. Perhaps these were just wild pipe dreams he had been fantasizing over these last few weeks, but Harry thought the possibility was far from unrealistic.

The second of these dark thoughts was that the Dursleys' behaviour over these past number of weeks had only validated what both Voldemort and Grindelwald had told him.

Muggles would stop at nothing and felt no compunctions when it came to destroying what they failed to understand and they really had no place in dominating witches and wizards. Harry felt more bitter about the latter point than he had ever felt before. It hadn't been something he considered before his forced meeting with Grindelwald, but the thought had crept up more than was normal in the past two weeks and it sounded more and more true the longer his forced imprisonment stretched on.

He was sick of it.

He was sick of all of it and could take no more.

He had stayed up as long as his body would allow. He decided to give in to boredom and fatigue as he slumped back down on his bed. Before he closed his eyes, he had but one thought as his hand reached up and fingered the pendant that had thus far sat idly on his neck as a result of his own indecision.

But it lay inactive no longer.

It was as though Harry had blinked and woken up once more, but he was no longer in his room on Privet Drive. He was in a dark, airy place that he remembered all too well, for it was a place he had unwillingly visited in his dreams on every passing night.

But this time was different.

He had willed it to happen this time, and there were some oddities that were not present in those dreams.

The guards who had laid dead outside Grindelwald's cell before were gone. The only thing that remained of them were several dark stains on the stones that Harry knew had been caused by their blood.

"You have seen the light, it seems."

That voice was every bit as terrifying as Harry remembered, but its speaker's tones reflected something Harry had not yet experienced in his presence.

"You sound surprised for someone who seemed so confident I would use the pendant."

Grindelwald chuckled. "I am not taken aback to see you here. I am merely surprised you stand before me so soon."

Harry tried to keep the bitterness and hatred he felt for the Dursley family off of his face, but he knew he had failed. "I have... a request."

Grindelwald's lips twitched. "A pressing one at that."

Harry set his jaw. "I need a way out of a locked room without a wand. There's nothing inside it but a cot."

Amusement danced in the old man's eyes. "How ironic a request to ask of me. Fear not, Harry Potter. If this is how I must prove to you my intentions carry no malice, then so be it."

**Author's Endnote:**

**I said this wouldn't start updating on FFN and AO3 again until October, but I had a very productive couple of months and am already nearing the end of book 2, so I see no need to hold onto it any longer.**

**THIS STORY WILL BE POSTED ONCE PER WEEK --- EVERY SUNDAY --- UNTIL THE END OF BOOK 2.**

**I ended book one on a massive cliffhanger, so I hope the start of book two lived up to the hype.**

**You likely all think you've read the same second year over and over again, and there will be several similarities to the canon, of course; but trust me --- you will all see by the year's end that this is probably unlike any second year you've read before. In time, you will see what I mean.**

**I will also just give a disclaimer right now. Second year is much darker than book 1. There are a number of scenes that some people may find disturbing to read.

**Chapter 2: Corruption and Control**

***July 7, 1992***

***The Headmaster's Office, Hogwarts***

***9:00 PM***

The night was dark and the clouds were thick, allowing no moonlight to penetrate their unbroken veil. This cast the titanic form of Hogwarts castle into shadow, making the massive shape look like a looming fortress on the horizon to any who might have approached it.

Inside this structure, all seemed quiet. Almost all of its occupants had retreated home for the summer holidays; the sole exception was the place's master, who still resided in one of the castle's highest towers.

This man sat behind his desk and peered at his office's door with folded hands and a patient expression. He seemed to be waiting for something and he did not so much as flinch when his clock struck nine, nor when there came a knock at his door.

"Enter."

A sallow-skinned man with long, greasy hair stepped inside, closing the door behind him with an impressive lack of noise. He crossed the office just as silently, sliding smoothly into his place across from the silver-haired man who sat behind the room's desk.

"Ah, Severus. So long it feels since we last met, yet so short a time has truly passed."

Snape did not look impressed. "I did not come here for niceties, Dumbledore. I came here for answers, as you well know."

"And I promised you would have them; a promise I very much plan to uphold. Forgive my delay, but it is always proper decorum on the part of the host to at least try and inquire after their guest's wellbeing."

"Your concern has been acknowledged," Snape said with a curled lip. "Now, how long must I wait to be given what I came for?"

"No longer, I suppose," Dumbledore answered with a weary expression. "I fear this discussion may be taxing on the both of us, which only means it is best if we see it through with haste."

"What happened the night after exams concluded? Not one, but two students in the hospital wing and the heir of a Founding Twelve family dead without a satisfactory explanation."

Dumbledore closed his eyes and thought very deeply. "What I am about to tell you is something which can never leave this room."

One of Snape's eyebrows rose. "Was that not a working assumption?"

"I certainly hope so, but this is different. This is a truth more monumental than any I have imparted onto you thus far. Swear to me, Severus, that nothing I say will ever leave this room."

Snape watched Dumbledore impassively and the headmaster could practically see the man's mental calculations through his black, tunnel-like eyes.

Snape nodded slowly after a long pause. "Very well. Nothing you tell me will ever leave this office. I swear it and will vow with my life if I must."

"I think not," said Dumbledore. "Your word is enough for me." The headmaster sat back in his chair, running a steady hand through his beard as he thought very deeply. "You know, of course, that Quirinus spent the entirety of the school year hoping to get his hands on the Philosopher's Stone?" Snape nodded curtly. "Then I am sure it will come as no surprise to you that he decided to make his move on the very night you speak of."

Snape nodded once more. Dumbledore had suspected that Snape would assume that had been the case, but the old man thought it only prudent to start there.

"I had thought not," Dumbledore continued. "All of this, you have easily deduced from basic extrapolations of relevant facts. What I think it likely you have not discovered is that, for the duration of the year, we were not fighting Quirinus Quirrell, but the one-time master you so bravely abandoned."

Snape's eyes actually widened for a full second before he gained mastery over his emotions once more. "*He*... was here?"

"He was indeed. You will remember that, on the night we spoke of protecting Lily's son, you told me that there was no need?" Another nod from Snape, this one much stiffer. "You will also doubtlessly remember what I told you on that night?"

"You said that the Dark Lord would one day return."

"I did indeed, and this year has only proven me to be correct."

"In what capacity was he here?"

"He has not yet returned, if that is the reason for your question. It is difficult for me to hypothesize about what state Lord Voldemort has rested in for the past decade. I have always thought that it is likely something akin to a wraith."

"You're telling me that he possessed Quirrell for an entire year without the fool fighting him off or his body decomposing from the stress?"

"Yes and no." Dumbledore suddenly looked more grave than usual. Snape would have even gone as far as to say the man looked put off. "I am saying that Voldemort, in one way or another, came into contact with our former professor during his travels. Likely in Albania, as I have had my suspicions for some time that Albania is where he has dwelled for all these years. When they met, Voldemort likely disillusioned Quirrell with promises of power and grandeur the likes of which he had never dreamed of. Once he had him completely spellbound, it seems that he must have arranged for an accident of some kind."

"What you're saying," Snape began slowly, "is that Quirrell was never here this past year and that the Dark Lord was in complete and total control of what was essentially an empty vessel?"

"I confess that I hadn't known such a thing to be possible before, but it is the only conclusion I can come to. I had my suspicions that Voldemort may have been occupying Quirrell's body with the man's twisted blessing, but our confrontation at the year's end dissuaded me of that belief. There was no sign of Quirinus in that corridor. It was truly and completely Voldemort. He was greatly weakened and at most a shell of what he had been, but everything about him was undoubtedly him."

"The unicorn blood," mused Snape. "That is why so many were lost this past year."

"That is my belief, yes."

"And for how long did you suspect the Dark Lord to be at Hogwarts?"

"I must admit that my suspicions arose quite early in the school year. An attack on Nicholas's home took place early in the summer prior, which was what prompted him to deem it necessary for the stone to be more firmly protected. He had no available usages of the Fidelius Charm left, you see, so he entrusted it to me. He wished for me to put it under a Fidelius of my own, but I talked him down from that idea. That is a charm I do not want to waste now. You do not get to use it freely and at the time, I hadn't the foggiest idea that Lord Voldemort might be involved. It was him whom I was saving my usages for, in essence. If I had known, I might have been more agreeable to Nicholas's original plan.

"Yet when I placed it at Hogwarts and Quirrell returned not to retake his post as professor of Muggle Studies, but of Defence Against the Dark Arts, I won't say that I did not have my suspicions. I believe the curse on that position to be very real. So naturally, I watched him closely. As you yourself said to me on the night of Samhain, he was most unlike himself. This could have been explained away through his travels, but there were other, more troubling things."

"Oh?" asked Snape, sounding oddly detached by now.

"You had implied that night that Quirinus taught your Slytherins with a shockingly high degree of competency despite the rest of the school complaining about the man's inability to teach. This was odd to me. There was, of course, the obvious fact that Harry Potter was in the very house he seemed to grant priority; but there was also the lesser-known fact that before he became known as the monster that is Voldemort, he was but a boy. A boy who wanted nothing more than to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts upon his graduation from Hogwarts.

"The headmaster at the time denied him, citing the fact he was much too young. Voldemort even returned years later to inquire after the position again not long after I had replaced old Armando as the castle's headmaster. I had always been suspicious of Voldemort as he grew and matured, and I felt uneasy about the whispers I was hearing about him by then. I, of course, denied him the position, but he never let it go. There is also the matter of the curse on the post --- which I always thought was his doing --- and now there was this. In a sick sort of way, his actions allowed him to both study his defeater and live out his childhood ambitions."

Dumbledore's face scrunched up in distaste. "There is also the business with Argus. Voldemort and his followers always were fond of the Imperius Curse and I do not think Quirinus was ever capable of such magic."

"Yet you told no one of your suspicions?"

"I believed Voldemort to be no more than an attachment of Quirinus. Still a brilliant mind, but not nearly as threatening as he turned out to be. It was a horrific mistake on my part which may well have cost the young Longbottom boy his life. For that, I shall forever be regretful."

"There is... something I don't understand." When Dumbledore stared pensively back at him, Snape took it as his cue to continue. "You told me that when the Dark Lord attacked Potter, the Killing Curse rebounded." Dumbledore nodded. "By all laws of magic, the Dark Lord should have died. Yet he lived on as a wraith, if you are correct, and still had the power to not only plan his return, but to forcefully possess others. For all of your extensive talents, it is I who am the foremost expert on the darkest of magics this castle houses and I fail to see how this is in any way possible."

There was a long pause during which Dumbledore's expression was completely blank. Snape wondered whether or not the man was trying to piece the same thing together, or whether he was trying to decide whether or not the Potions Master should be made aware of things he already knew.

"I am not certain," Dumbledore said eventually.

"But you have ideas."

"A few," the man admitted, "though none I shall speak on without irrefutable confirmation. I am certain that it is only through the blackest of magics that Lord Voldemort survives. Magics that I will not dare speak of without just cause, even with you. I trust you implicitly and know you are very far from a pure soul, but there are some things that men are much better off not knowing unless circumstance deems that blissful ignorance to be impossible."

"You won't tell me then?"

"One day, I may. Alas, that day has not yet come. Do you have any further questions for me, Severus?"

"That night," Snape reminded.

"Ah, yes. It is my understanding that Masters Weasley and Longbottom, along with the young Miss Granger, actually thought you to be the would-be thief."

Snape actually snorted derisively, sneering at the mere idea. "Leave it up to one as idiotic and thick-headed as Weasley. I'd have hoped at least the Granger girl might have dissuaded such foolishness. For all of her many faults, I did at least think she was intelligent."

"I believe they caught sight of your injuries post-Samhain after having seen the cerberus prior to. They leapt to what, at the time, seemed the most rational conclusion.

"They decided to go after the stone that night on a horribly misguided mission of keeping you away from it." Dumbledore's expression darkened. "Young Master Longbottom had the misfortune of being alone with Voldemort in the final chamber. He was not immediately killed, but immobilized and later used as a hostage when I arrived on the scene."

"And Potter?"

"I am... unsure as to how Harry came to be there. I certainly don't get the impression he went after the stone. I think it\'s likely a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time." Snape's sneer made it known exactly how likely he thought that possibility to be. "He came face-to-face with Lord Voldemort and lost his head as any boy in his position would doubtlessly have. When I permitted Voldemort to exit the castle with the stone---"

"Excuse me?"

"Come now, Severus. Surely, you would not have had me condemn the boy to death?"

"If the alternative is the Dark Lord's return, I fail to see how keeping the boy alive could be justified."

"Would you say the same thing if Harry was in his position?"

Snape visibly hesitated and then scowled. "What does it matter to you?" he snarled. "I have never once claimed to be the peak of human morality. You should have expected this when you took a former Death Eater as your spy."

The old man sighed very deeply. "I do not judge you, Severus. It is the same flaw that drove you to the light in the first place, so I cannot revolt too heavily against it. I am only sorry your life experiences have willed it into existence to begin with."

"If you are quite finished doing a pathetic impression of a therapist, I believe you were telling me how the Longbottom boy died."

"So I was. After I permitted Voldemort to leave the castle with the stone, Harry intervened." Snape had not seen such an overwhelming amount of sadness in Dumbledore's eyes since the night the Potters had died. "He really did believe he was helping," said Dumbledore. There was an odd note of bitterness in his voice.

"But when he took matters into his own, useless hands," gritted out Snape, "he spelt the doom of his fellow classmate." Dumbledore nodded with resignation. "I am undecided if it is better or worse that Potter stumbled into this situation of his own accord and not by any machinations of either yourself or the Dark Lord."

Dumbledore winced imperceptibly despite not being all that surprised. Snape was a spiteful man when angered and he would lash out at any target in his vicinity.

"Do you have any other questions for me, Severus?" The man shook his head. "Very well, I believe that is all for tonight, then."

Snape was out of his chair before Dumbledore had started speaking and the office door had slammed shut before he had finished. The bang awoke his phoenix, who raised his head and blinked at his master, obviously perplexed.

Dumbledore just sighed again. "Some things never change, my friend."

***July 17, 1992***

***8:12 AM***

***NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM'S FUNERAL SET FOR WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS TWELFTH BIRTHDAY***

***By Rita Skeeter***

"Honestly," thundered Molly Weasley, "the nerve of that... that... conniving, two-faced *trollop*!"

Ron suspected that either Fred, George, or both would have whistled or applauded the creativity of their mother's cursing had the situation been different. As it was, making light out of the death of a student was a touch far, even by the twins' lofty standards.

"Oh, if I could get my hands on this parasite," Ron's mother continued. "Leeching off the death of a child just to further her own career! And she goes on and on in this rag about how there was no good explanation! She makes it sound as though Dumbledore is covering the whole thing up like it's some sort of great murder mystery. Why can't she just let the families grieve and be done with it?"

"That's Skeeter for you," said Arthur as he rubbed at his eyes, pushing his half-eaten breakfast aside as he got hastily to his feet. "Well, I'd better get to work. I know it's a touch early, but I've got a long day ahead of me. Have a nice day, Molly, dear." He looked at his children. "Behave yourselves."

Ron couldn't blame his father for wanting to get away, even if his attempt had been terribly transparent. He had wanted nothing more than to get away himself for the past number of weeks, though his reasons had little to do with Rita Skeeter --- though the woman certainly hadn't helped matters.

She had written on and off about Neville's mysterious death ever since the close of Ron's first year at Hogwarts. He could understand writing an article. It was a major event, whether anybody liked it or not. He had never heard of a student dying at Hogwarts, so he could understand that this was big news. Especially since it had happened under Dumbledore's nose and in a place that many considered to be among the safest in the country.

The official story had been that Neville had stumbled and fallen down a set of stairs one night while on his way back to the common room. It had been the night after they had all completed their final exam, so it wasn't entirely unreasonable to assume he had been fatigued. Especially since he had apparently gotten tripped up by the infamous trick step, which was now being disenchanted due to the tragedy it had caused.

What made these articles so repulsive was the fact that Skeeter just seemed completely unwilling to accept that cause. She had spent the better part of a month speculating about Neville's passing and exactly how it had happened. Worse still, the speculations weren't even so much whether or not it was a cover-up. They were more so wondering exactly how bad the truth had been if the school felt the need to cover it up in the first place.

And the worst part was knowing that the hag was actually right to doubt the cover story and right to wonder how bad the truth had been.

Ron, of course, knew how Neville had died and it only made things all the worse.

It was Quirrell, not Snape, who went after the stone. Dumbledore had filled in the gaps in the story they didn't have. Quirrell had read about the stone during his travels and had become slightly deranged. He had thus returned to the school in search of the artifact, knowing it would grant him wealth and power beyond his wildest dreams.

He had murdered Neville in the final chamber before taking the stone, at which point he had been stopped by Dumbledore and --- if he and Hermione were correct in their assumption --- Potter.

They could think of no other reason to give Slytherin as many points as Potter had earned during the final feast. How on earth he could have played such a large part in stopping Quirrell, neither of them knew.

*"Well,"* Hermione had said, *"he is the Boy-Who-Lived. He beat You-Know-Who as a* *baby and no one knows how he did it. Maybe whatever let him beat You-Know-Who was what let him beat Quirrell?"*

It had sounded so fantastical that Ron had had a difficult time believing it, but he had no better explanation to put forth.

How Potter could have figured anything out about the stone, or about Quirrell, or about any of it, they had no idea.

Ron didn't know the boy all that well. He hung around with a bunch of twats, but the two of them had scarcely interacted. They had nearly come to blows over the remembrall back in September and Potter had somewhat been a part of Malfoy's ploy to get him into trouble that night. That had not been a good first impression, but the two really hadn't interacted much after that. Potter was quiet in Potions --- the only class Ron shared with him --- and seemed to mostly keep his head down out of class. He was often found in the library, sometimes alone, sometimes with his friend Nott, and on other, rarer occasions, he was joined by his gang of wankers.

Ron knew he had nowhere near enough information to have a real opinion of Potter. Perhaps he had judged wrong if the young Slytherin really had helped to prevent the stone's theft.

He supposed it didn't really matter in the end.

The only thing that mattered was that Neville was gone. What was even more surreal was that it could easily have been either him or Hermione. Any of the three of them could have advanced to that final chamber, at which point they would have met their end at the hands of a deranged Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.

Skeeter's articles just reminded Ron about that, not to mention the horrible guilt he felt for even having played an indirect role in the whole thing. If he had just been better, maybe they wouldn't have had to go after Quirrell in the first place. Maybe they could have stopped him earlier or, at the very least, gone to Dumbledore sooner and prevented the whole thing.

It was all just painful to think about.

Cedric had done his best to keep Ron's mind off of it all so far this summer. The boy had first approached him and Hermione on the train, joined by their yearmates Susan Bones and Hannah Abbott. The trio of Hufflepuffs had ridden with them the entire ride back to London and they had all promised to keep in touch.

Cedric had written Ron just a few days later and asked whether or not he might enjoy a bit of Quidditch. Their fathers knew each other at work and either through that connection or through some other way, Cedric had heard that the Weasleys had a large orchard in which the family practiced Quidditch.

Ron might not have known Cedric for long, but the boy had seemed like a good bloke on the train. The fact that he was two full years older intimidated him for a while, but Cedric just had a way of putting any who spoke with him at ease. It helped that the two Hufflepuff girls from his year seemed to view him as an older brother, which somehow just made the whole thing feel more natural.

In a way, Ron could already see exactly why they thought the way they did.

Cedric had spent much of his time at the Burrow over the summer and he had inquired after Ron's wellbeing more times than his actual brothers had done over the course of his life.

He was also masterful on a broom --- that bit certainly had not hindered Ron's estimation of him. Cedric had been the reserve seeker this past year, but he would almost definitely be on the team full-time starting in September. Ron was actually unsure whether or not he would be able to beat Cedric to the snitch. The boy wasn't the most incredible flyer Ron had ever met --- he had nothing on Charlie and honestly, Ron thought himself to be more talented --- but Cedric had a brilliant mind for Quidditch. He had an eagle's eye and a knack for finding the snitch; always taking the shortest route possible without so much as a second thought. He had an instinctual way of playing Quidditch that was simply awe-inspiring.

Ron appreciated Cedric's presence more than he could put into words. Especially since Hermione hadn't been able to meet up with him and likely wouldn't be until their inevitable trip to Diagon Alley.

During those moments with Cedric, Ron had experienced a fleeting reprieve from everything that had encompassed the end of his first year, but Skeeter's articles brought everything back into perspective.

Hell, even the *few* articles she hadn't written about Neville hadn't been at all pleasant. Most had slandered his father and his proposed Muggle Protection Act, whereas others had broken the news that Hagrid had been sent to Azkaban on a one-year sentence. Charlie had actually said he'd gotten off remarkably easy and chalked it up to probable intervention on the part of Dumbledore.

"Mum," Ron asked suddenly, an odd thought creeping up.

"What is it, dear?" his mother answered in a clipped tone of voice. His brothers and sister were all looking at him like he was crazy for daring to speak to their mother whilst she was in this kind of mood.

"Can I, or we, or whatever, go to Neville's funeral?" A heavy air filled the room. "I mean, he was one of my best mates at Hogwarts. It... it helped with Uncle Billius when I was a kid. I... thought it might help me deal with... you know."

Molly's expression softened. "I doubt it will be a public event, Ron, but I'll mail Augusta Longbottom and see what she says. I... understand this must be hard on you and I'm sorry you had to go through it."

Ron felt himself encompassed in a tight hug and, unlike most times his mother seemed to try and squeeze all oxygen from his lungs, he didn't protest nor attempt to pull away. This time, he actually felt as though he'd needed it.

***July 22, 1992***

***No. 4 Privet Drive***

***11:14 PM***

Harry's eyes shot open as he took a deep breath of air.

Stale, dry air that had been trapped in his room for as long as he had.

Earlier that day had been the first time his door was opened for anything other than closely escorting him to the bathroom once or twice a day. It had been by his uncle, who had barged in and informed him that he, his wife, and his son would be leaving Privet Drive that night to attend a dinner party hosted by one of Vernon's more important coworkers. They would be spending the night in a hotel and Harry wouldn't be let out that evening to use the bathroom.

Harry had just blankly nodded along at the time, hoping beyond hope that his suspicions about the plan he had been hatching for the past two-and-a-half weeks were correct and that it was going as well as he thought it was.

It all hinged on the wild idea Grindelwald had shared with him during that first dream vision. An idea that Harry had quickly warmed up and clasped onto like a drowning man might a derelict raft when he realized it might well be his only option.

***The Past***

***July 3, 1992***

***Nurmengard Prison***

***10:08 PM***

Harry blinked at Grindelwald, hardly able to believe the man had solved his plight in a matter of seconds. "You know how to get me out?"

"The solution is quite simple, from a conceptual perspective. In actuality, I am afraid its execution will be anything but --- though I have no doubts you will manage. Look at it as an opportunity to prove your potential. Not to me, but to yourself; for I know you do not believe in your capabilities quite as highly as you should."

Deciding whether or not he agreed with that statement would require more self-reflection than Harry was willing to do whilst preoccupied with trying to escape from his prison.

"What's your idea, then?"

"Wandless magic."

"Wand... what?"

Grindelwald smiled. "I am unsurprised you have never heard of it. Even in my time, Hogwarts was the most consistent school because its goal was to churn out as many productive magicians as possible. The problem with this approach is that it does not breed excellence, nor does it promote exceptionalism. Durmstrang was quite the opposite. It is unreasonably demanding and produces outstanding witches and wizards."

Harry frowned. "Durmstrang is another school, then?"

"It is indeed. It is the one I attended in my youth."

"So it's better than Hogwarts?" Harry had been told by no small number of people that Hogwarts was the best school in the world.

Grindelwald gave a noncommittal gesture. "Who is to say? Better is an abstract term that can be applied in many ways. I believe it is better suited for exceptional magicians who wish to reach their full potential, but many students fail out of Durmstrang each year. Many more than the numbers who drop from Hogwarts in a decade. Whether that is better or worse is merely a matter of perspective."

"Right," said Harry, "so wandless magic, I think you called it?"

"Yes, I was saying how I am unsurprised you have never heard of it. I doubt they will ever mention it at Hogwarts. Not when their penchant is to produce competence rather than excellence. Wandless magic is as simple as it sounds, yet infinitely more complex. It is the name given to any feat of magic performed without the use of one's wand."

"How is that complicated?"

"It is complicated because to use it, one must gain a true mastery of the spell they wish to cast with. Only then can they have the ability to cast it wandlessly and many could never dream of attaining the ability."

"What if I don't have the spell mastered?"

Grindelwald raised an aged brow. "Do you not?"

"Well... I have no trouble with the spell---"

"You will have no trouble then."

"But, I haven't used it much---"

"That matters not. Not all magicians are rabble who must slave away for hours over the simplest of spells. For some of us, magic is our gift. It flows more naturally and bends to our whims. I was one of these lucky few blessed with such a magnificent gift and so are you. You have also been casting with a wand for only a year, which will make things much simpler. Fear not, Harry Potter. I see no reason why you can't be free of your prison by the month's end."

***Back in the present...***

Grindelwald had explained the general theory of how magic was cast, which was something Harry had never learned before.

Magic wasn't within a person; it was a force all around them. What separated witches and wizards from muggles was that they had the ability to draw that magic in and project it back out in order to yield desired effects. They were, in essence, conductors. Some of them just so happened to be better conductors than others, which was how one wizard might be more 'powerful' than another.

Grindelwald had warned Harry not to put too much stock in this. Power was far from everything, according to him. He said he would give Harry that lecture another day if the boy wanted it, but only after he was free. The long and the short of it, he had said, was that power did not define a wizard. It perhaps indicated their potential, but nothing more than that. It was actually one of the less important factors for most wizards. If Grindelwald was to be believed, it hardly ever mattered unless the wizard in question was truly exceptional and had mastered most other elements of magic.

Wands were supposedly used because they made conducting magic much easier. Witches and wizards could just get greater effects from less magic with a wand, which was why all British wizards --- along with most others around the world --- received one at the age of eleven.

The only downside to this, according to Grindelwald, was that the longer one used an implement, the more reliant they became upon it; which was why he had said Harry only having one for a year might make things easier.

Not that any part of the plan had been easy.

Casting a spell without a wand, as it turned out, was the single most difficult thing Harry had ever done.

The concentration required was of a level Harry could barely comprehend. He had to understand everything about the spell --- even things like its Arithmetic equation; and hadn't *that* been an interesting thing for Grindelwald to explain to a child who had barely even heard of Arithmancy.

Just knowing everything about it wasn't enough though.

It all had to become automatic and conjoin with intent so clear that Harry still hadn't managed it.

But he was close.

He had known for about a week he was close, but yesterday had been by far the most tantalizing attempt. He had actually felt the lock shift, though not enough.

Somehow, he knew tonight was the night.

It just all aligned too perfectly to be anything other than the case. The Dursleys were gone and Harry was sure he could do it.

He crossed the room and placed his hand on the doorknob, focusing harder than he had ever focused before.

His first six attempts failed, but on the seventh, the lock finally clicked after nearly three weeks of waiting.

Harry's face split into an ear-to-ear grin as he practically sprinted out of his room, down the stairs, and unlocked his old resting place, pulling from it his trunk, wand, and all other magical items he owned. This door had been easier. Harry had heard of the placebo effect before and he wondered whether or not it had any impact on magic. Perhaps now that he knew he was capable of performing the spell, it would become less difficult.

Harry already had a plan.

He had heard of the Knight Bus from his pureblooded friends, and Lucius had told him at the train station, in no uncertain terms, that Harry was welcome at Malfoy Manor whenever his relatives allowed.

What he hadn't planned for was the owl, carrying with it an official warning from the Ministry of Magic not to use magic outside of school again.

Harry had at first thought it to be a note of expulsion and he had almost dropped dead from heart failure. When he realized it was only a warning, he had breathed a deep sigh of relief.

Better to be warned for breaking a relatively minor law than to be trapped in a room by people who weren't fit to clean his wand.

***Some time later, at Malfoy Manor...***

Harry had walked out onto the street and stuck out his wand arm, as he had been told that would summon the bus.

It did, though Harry had been unprepared for the speed of its arrival and the accompanying *BANG* had jolted him so badly he'd ended up on his rear end.

After a pimply teen not too many years older than Harry had asked him what he had fallen over for, he had been let on the bus after lying that his name was Justin Finch-Fletchley as opposed to Harry Potter. He didn't want the attention and thought a posh-sounding muggleborn name would do best.

Not long later, he was getting off at the start of a long drive, lined by towering hedges which gave the whole thing a sinister sort of feel. Far ahead, he could see massive, wrought iron gates that were mercifully left open. Harry briefly wondered why on earth they would be left open and intended on immediately informing Lord Malfoy of the security risks that posed.

Then, he remembered that wards existed and he had become rather sheepish and just hoped they would allow him through since the Malfoys had extended an invitation. He had no idea whether or not wards could work that way.

He was alone in the dark and out in the middle of nowhere. He felt as though some sort of creature would appear from the shadows and strike at any moment. It was odd and irrational, but Harry didn't consider it at the time.

He just slid on his invisibility cloak and trudged his way towards the manor's front entrance, as the cloak was the thing at Hogwarts that had made him feel most safe.

He was so caught up in worry whether the Malfoys may be upset by his late-night arrival that he completely disregarded the odd fact that, as soon as he threw on the cloak, all fear washed completely away.

***Minutes later...***

Lucius had been doing work in his study when he had been alerted that the front door of the manor had opened.

His blood had run cold.

The wards hadn't alerted him to anyone's arrival and both Narcissa and Draco were asleep in their beds.

He could only think of one man who might have the desire to enter his home and the capabilities of doing so in this manner.

It made an odd sort of sense, since the man had allegedly written to him not all that long ago.

Yet he did not find that man in the entrance hall of his home.

Instead, he found a young boy with raven hair and bright green eyes dragging a trunk that looked much too heavy for him and carrying something oddly silver under his arm.

"Mister Potter?" he asked, so taken aback he forgot all about the title of heir.

The boy had been apologetic and had even seemed terrified Lucius would be upset, but the man wasn't upset at all.

Draco had complained to no end about how the Potter boy hadn't been responding to his letters and Lucius had become worried the muggles may not have followed his orders. He had begun making inquiries at the Ministry in an effort to find where Potter lived. It was apparently one of the most heavily guarded secrets in the wizarding world judging by how difficult it was to get an answer.

Yet here the boy was in his home, which had been the plan all along.

Lucius did not dare think on it until the boy's footsteps had escaped beyond his range of hearing. Yet the only thing he seemed capable of doing once he was alone was wondering how in the name of Merlin he had breached his wards --- seemingly without a second thought.

As concerning as it was, Lucius supposed it was but one more reason to stick to the plan.

***Malfoy Manor***

***8:03 AM***

Harry awoke to a loud bang that instantly jolted him. He was jumpy at the best of times, but this was particularly notable. He had spent the better part of a month locked up in the same room; there had certainly been no sounds like that to occupy his day --- especially not in the house of his terribly normal muggle relatives.

It actually took him a moment upon waking to realize where he was. The bed felt much too warm and comfortable and the room was much too bright. His room on Privet Drive only had a small, grimy window. Wherever he was now seemed so bright it appeared as though the dazzling sunlight streamed inside unimpeded.

"Where the hell have you been?!"

It was the familiar voice that prompted Harry to remember what had happened. He knew that voice all too well; it was a voice he had been hearing regularly for most of the past ten or so months. A perpetually bored-sounding voice that, in its current state of excitement, didn't quite carry it's typical drawling quality.

"Morning, Draco," Harry muttered, sitting up on the bed and steadily remembering how he had escaped Privet Drive, been given an official warning for underage magic, and then arrived at Malfoy Manor in the middle of the night.

It was really no wonder he was so disoriented. He couldn't remember even a single time Draco had been awake before he had. It marked a first, but he supposed it made sense.

It was the first time in weeks his sleep had been anything resembling restful. The pendant that allowed him to communicate with Grindelwald was an incredible bit of magic --- no matter how conflicted Harry felt about the moral troubles of the situation it presented. Its biggest downside was that while he was technically asleep, communicating with Grindelwald didn't seem to really recharge him. Mixed with horrendous nightmares about his friends' necks snapping right in front of him and their spines piercing their jaws as their heads contorted in horrible ways whilst somehow at Nurmengard prison, Harry hadn't been experiencing much in the way of rest since the school year had concluded.

Last night had also been more than a little bit eventful. Even if Harry had been well rested, he doubted he would have completely escaped the emotional exhaustion inevitably associated with such an eventful night.

"*That's* the first thing you say?" Draco asked incredulously. "I haven't seen nor heard from you in a month and then you just greet me like nothing ever happened?"

That was when Harry remembered something else from the night previous; a much smaller detail from his very brief conversation with Lord Malfoy he hadn't put a whole lot of stock into at the time.

"You wrote to me?" he asked, still rubbing furiously at his eyes before clumsily jamming his glasses onto his nose, having to once more blink from the onslaught of light.

He had been placed in one of the many spare rooms at Malfoy Manor. The floor was made of rich, dark wood, as was the desk and other bits of furniture. The walls were a deep, tasteful green, as were the bedsheets Harry had just pushed aside. Notwithstanding the attached bathroom and the expansive walk-in closet filled with rich-looking clothes, the room's main feature was the massive, floor-to-ceiling window. It made up an entire wall and its centre slid aside on command, allowing one to step out onto the balcony and observe the breathtaking view of the grounds, which were comprised of stunning gardens that looked fit for gods; vast, open fields; not one, but two lakes; a full-sized Quidditch pitch; and a forest far off in the distance.

These were much nicer surroundings than Harry was accustomed to, but that came as no surprise. The Malfoys weren't just one of the wealthiest families in the magical world, but they also liked people to know that fact was true. Everything about this place screamed of ostentatious wealth but Harry didn't mind. He thought it was, barring Hogwarts, the single-most incredible place he had ever seen.

"Of course I wrote to you," Draco said with a roll of his eyes. "I've been writing to you almost every second day."

Harry finally stopped blinking the sun out of his eyes and peered intently towards Draco. "I never got your mail. I never got any mail from anyone."

Draco, who had seemed to be building up towards some kind of tirade, paused and suddenly looked aghast. "You... what?"

Harry just nodded, biting his bottom lip. He had never told Draco any details about his time at the Dursleys. Doing so now was doubtlessly going to be uncomfortable, but that wasn't what worried him most.

"Draco... if I... tell you how my summer's gone so far, will you promise not to tell anyone --- no matter what?"

"Why would I need to promise that?"

The real answer was because Harry knew enough about Slytherin to understand how it worked. The house was a nest of vultures. First years were largely let off the hook, as older students seemed to have a sort of honour code and mostly left them to their business. That wasn't *entirely* true, but at the very least they wouldn't openly antagonize them. Travers and his group of thugs had been a bit different, since they themselves had only been second years. His older brother who had been stopped by Fawley... well, that had been a sort of exception.

Now that Harry was officially entering his second year, that safety blanket was about to disappear, and he would be lying if he said he wasn't more than a little bit apprehensive about it. The last thing he wanted was to give his foes ammunition such as details about his home life.

The good news was that he had the open support of the heirs --- and in Pansy's case, heiress --- of some of the most important and influential pureblood families in the country. The bad news was that Harry knew Travers was far from the only student who didn't appreciate the halfblood defeater of Voldemort being sorted into the house of cunning.

He hadn't been deaf to the whispers and he wasn't daft. He knew by now that many Slytherins had close familial ties to those who had once served Voldemort. Some of their relatives had died in the war, while others were sent to Azkaban. The Travers brothers, for example, had an uncle who was serving a life sentence in the prison. Even Draco and Diana were related to Bellatrix Lestrange, who had been convicted for torturing Neville Longbottom's parents into insanity.

Harry shook his head to rid himself of any thoughts about Neville. They brought up memories that were best left untouched, especially when he was trying to think with anything resembling rational clarity.

"Just answer the question, Draco."

"Fine," he agreed with an oddly strained expression. "I won't tell anyone about whatever's happened over your summer."

And then, Harry began his tale.

It was only some time later --- and a considerable amount of cursing on Draco's part --- that the two young Slytherins made their way downstairs and into the family's main dining hall. If Harry hadn't seen the Great Hall at Hogwarts, he might have lost his jaw to shock. The chandelier alone looked like it cost more than the Dursleys' entire house, and that was to say nothing of the rest of the room.

"Ah, Draco, Harry. A pleasure to see the both of you awake."

"Good morning, Father," Draco greeted, taking a seat across from the man as Harry sat beside him and across from his sister, Diana. All four Malfoys were now present at the table, which struck Harry as being somewhat odd.

"How did you sleep, Mister Potter?" Mr. Malfoy --- as the man had told him last night to drop the title of lord whilst in his home --- asked.

"Better than I have in a long time, sir."

"I'm glad to hear it. We never did get much time to talk at King's Cross Station. You seemed most... distracted by your unfortunate plight."

Harry was relieved the man only suspected his state to be as a result of his dread over returning to the Dursleys. When the Malfoys had found him on the platform, Harry had been as white as a ghost, shaking like a leaf in a strong autumn breeze, and trying not to vomit.

"I... yeah, sorry about that, sir."

"Not to worry, dear boy. Your misfortune was truly a thing to dread. I do not blame you. I blame those who forced you into such a... position."

"The real question," asked Narcissa, examining Harry with her cool blue eyes, "is how are you feeling now? I can only imagine your treatment under the care of those muggle savages."

"I'm... okay now. It wasn't a great month."

Draco glanced meaningfully between Harry and his parents. There was a moment during which Harry thought the blond might break his promise just minutes after making it, but he mercifully stayed quiet.

Not that his message wasn't obvious. He clearly wanted Harry to tell his parents about what had occurred on Privet Drive. Harry wasn't necessarily opposed to the idea, but he would need to feel out his current situation first. The Malfoys had treated him with nothing but the utmost kindness since he had entered the magical world, but he didn't really know them on a personal level. He was much too worried about how they might react to such a tale to just throw it out casually. It also wasn't exactly easy for him to talk about, so it would require a bit of familiarity on his part.

There was also the small issue that they were adults... adults had never really helped Harry much in the past.

"I'm glad you're at least better now," Narcissa said with a small smile. "How was your first year at Hogwarts? Like Lucius said, we never did talk after your arrival back in London."

Harry clutched onto the switch of topics with the grace of a drowning man who had been thrown a life jacket, and launched into a heavily edited account of his first year at Hogwarts. He was very careful to make no mention of dead classmates or monologuing dark lords.

***The next day...***

Harry's first day at Malfoy Manor had probably been the most pleasant day outside of school he could ever remember.

The conversation about Hogwarts had taken up much of breakfast. Narcissa had professed open pride about Harry's outstanding grades in all of the wanded subjects, which had made him blush and feel oddly uncomfortable. It wasn't until several hours later that he realized why. It was the first time he could ever remember an adult openly indicating that they were proud of him. It was just... an odd feeling he wasn't entirely sure how to deal with.

Perhaps the best part of that meal had come when Harry had been discussing some of the troubles he'd had with older students.

***The previous morning...***

"You mustn't let them get to you," said Lucius. "They attack you out of jealousy."

"It doesn't really bother me," Harry responded. "I'm just a bit worried now that I'm not a first year. I'm not sure it will be as easy holding off older students who know more magic."

"Well if you are as studious as it seems, I suppose there is the summer for you to use to try and close that gap."

Harry had frowned deeply at that. "The summer, sir?" Lucius had just nodded and raised a brow, obviously unsure as to the source of Harry's confusion. "I thought we weren't allowed to use magic. Doesn't the ministry know right away?"

"There is a trace, yes, but it doesn't necessarily mean they know when you cast magic."

"But... when I... used it to get away from my relatives, I got a letter about it right away."

"Did you?" Mister Malfoy asked, leaning forward. "Tell me, Harry, could you have gotten away from your relatives' home without using magic?"

"No, sir."

"Hm, I think I'll have a chat with some old friends of mine at the ministry and explain the... extenuating circumstances which led to that particular bit of magic. I imagine you will have that warning removed by the week's end."

Draco was grinning ear-to-ear at Harry in a way that screamed of superiority. Harry had never seen him look so smug. It was odd. He had heard Draco speak of the power his father wielded many times, but bearing witness to it was an entirely different thing altogether.

"Thank you, sir. Your help means a lot."

"It is no trouble. Simply a horrible flaw in our governing system. To answer your earlier question, the ministry can't track *who* is casting magic. That is very much impossible. What they can do is detect *where* magic is being cast. They knew it was you because you were residing in a muggle neighbourhood. If only one person in the area can cast magic, it makes the job of identifying the culprit quite redundant. In highly populated areas or pureblood homes, the ministry can only detect that magic was cast. They have no way of knowing who cast it unless there are witnesses who come forward and report a violation of the Reasonable Decree for Underage Sorcery."

"Not that the ministry could detect magic here," Draco added. "Not with the wards on the manor."

Lucius smiled thinly. "Indeed. Much like many of the most prestigious homes in the country, this one is protected by very ancient and powerful magic that makes the ministry's efforts wasteful. Not that it would matter. The ministry relies on the families of students to enforce the law involving underage magic. I, for one, have no intention of depriving my children of such an advantage. Since you are now my ward for the summer, the same rules extend to you."

"So... I can cast magic?"

"Of course," said Narcissa. "If you're going to cast anything new that you think might be dangerous, do it with supervision."

"There's also the family library," Diana said with a wink to Harry. "I have a feeling you might be interested in that, as long as Mother and Father don't mind you using it."

"Of course not," dismissed Narcissa. "I would just ask that you stay away from the books closest to the right wall. Just avoid the closest few rows of shelves. Those books might too... mature for now."

***Back in the present...***

Harry had spent the rest of that day with Draco, but he made his way into the family library that next morning, keen to investigate the place.

It wasn't quite the size of the Hogwarts library --- which, according to *Hogwarts, A History,* was the largest collection of books in the country --- but it was still massive. Rows upon rows of shelves dominated almost all available floor space. Each shelf stretched high towards the ceiling, far taller than any ordinary bookshelf Harry had ever seen. Narcissa's warning actually barred Harry from reading a great number of books purely because of the volume of each shelf, but that number seemed small in comparison to the rest of the library.

The room had a very different sort of feel to it than the one at Hogwarts. Heavy curtains were pulled over what Harry could only assume to be a massive window, veiling all natural light. The room was lit only by a scarce number of torches dotted here and there, mostly at tables set up around the room so one could read with the aid of their light.

Harry looked around for some time before settling on a book on duelling. His discussion about the older Slytherins yesterday had really planted the idea in his mind that he ought to get better at using magic in combat. His mind briefly ventured towards images of broken necks and mutilated corpses, but Harry ruthlessly fought against that line of thought and dragged his mind back on track with a great degree of difficulty.

He had spent several hours in the library, sitting in a comfortable armchair, reading up on all kinds of new spells, and taking notes on all of them before the door opened loudly.

"There you are," Draco drawled. Harry couldn't help but notice how through those three words alone, he managed to somehow convey how he had spent so much time looking for Harry.

"I've been in here for ages. Sorry, but you weren't up when I got out of bed and I was curious."

"Yes, well, you were always going to end up in here eventually, weren't you?" Draco glanced towards the book in Harry's hands, but its cover was facing away from him. "What's caught your attention this morning?"

"A book on duelling," said Harry, flipping it around so that Draco could see its cover. "I've read about all kinds of new spells in this one. Not sure I can do a lot of them, but they seem dead useful."

"Ah, that one. Father warned me off that one a few years ago. Said most of the spells would be more aimed at older students. Have you tried any yet?" Harry shook his head. "Shame. If anyone our age can do them, it's probably you."

"We'll see how it goes, I guess."

"It'll have to wait, I'm afraid. Pansy's going to be here soon with Crabbe and Goyle, and Theodore is already on his way. I think Diana is having her friends over too. With the amount Pansy's been droning on about you in her letters, I think she'd kill me if I didn't drag you out to see her."

As Harry followed in Draco's wake, he couldn't help but reflect on that last statement and think just how odd it still felt to have people who were genuinely concerned about him.

Just another point in favour of the wizarding world. They didn't care if you were different, nor if you came from a background they didn't understand. They offered a fresh start and let one make something of themselves. Harry would be forever grateful for that.

***Several hours later...***

Harry, Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, and Cassius were all laughing by the time they landed, despite the fact they were all quite sore.

They had spent the better part of the last few hours up in the air on broomsticks playing Quidditch. They had played countless games of two aside, with the odd man out playing seeker. The game would end when the seeker caught the snitch. It just so happened that in addition to their full-size Quidditch pitch, the Malfoys had a fleet of brooms --- though Draco could be heard loudly complaining that none of them were any of Nimbus's last few models --- as well as several sets of balls and beater's bats.

Harry was actually astonished with how well he did. He was quite good as a chaser, though he did get knocked around a bit by the others. He was the smallest of the bunch by a considerable margin, and it showed. He was the quickest on a broom and seemed the most talented at quick maneuvers, but when he didn't manage to get out of the way, he was in trouble. He was completely rubbish as a beater, but the position he actually enjoyed most was that of seeker.

Nobody had caught the snitch faster than Harry and it wasn't a one off fluke, either. He did it on a number of occasions; by the time he caught his final snitch, he could see that Draco was visibly frustrated over something. Perhaps that he couldn't match Harry's impressive punctuality in catching the snitch, seemingly no matter how hard he tried.

The last round saw both Harry and Draco as chasers on the same side and they were laughing merrily by the time they landed near their other friends.

Theodore and Pansy had sat out the Quidditch games. Theodore had just never been interested in Quidditch and Harry doubted Pansy would be caught dead on a broom. Even if they could somehow convince her, the laughs wouldn't be worth the hours after them, during which Harry had no doubt she would complain endlessly about how the wind had completely ruined her hair and all sorts of other things he simply couldn't will himself to care about.

Diana and her best friend --- a tall girl named Cassandra Yaxley who had golden-blonde hair and deep green eyes --- had also sat out, talking amongst themselves and the younger Slytherins as they watched the rest of them up in the sky.

"Have fun?" Diana asked as soon as they landed, smiling vaguely at their unanimously displayed, care-free expressions.

All of them nodded, taking seats and happily beginning their assault on what was left of the picnic some of the Malfoy elves had prepared for them. Harry thought this oddly reminiscent of the day early in his first year when he and Draco had been flying, only to land and for Harry to meet Diana's friends for the first time before making quick work of a similarly prepared picnic.

The jovial atmosphere persisted for some time... right up until Pansy asked about why on earth Harry hadn't been answering any of her mail. The shriek she let out when he explained what had happened would have put a banshee to shame. Of all gathered, only Diana and Cassandra --- who preferred to be called Cassie --- managed not to react outwardly.

"Pathetic," cursed Theodore, spitting in the grass. "You should tell Lord Malfoy, Harry."

Draco's chest puffed out and his chin rose. It was similar to how he had looked the day before at breakfast, but Harry ignored him.

"Why though?" he asked. "What is there he can do? It already happened; it's not like he can fix it."

"With *that,*" said Cassie, "he could probably do more than you could imagine."

"Not to mention making sure you *never* go back," Cassius muttered darkly.

"Why did you go back in the first place?" Pansy asked, stomping her foot on the grass as she glared at Harry. He tried hard not to wither under her stare. "Didn't you hate it there?"

"I didn't have a choice," he mumbled by way of an answer.

"What do you mean you didn't have a choice?" asked Diana.

"Dumbledore told me I had to---"

"Of course it's Dumbledore," sneered Draco. "That old fool has to stop sticking that long, stupid nose of his where it doesn't belong. He has no right to tell the Boy-Who-Lived where he can and can't go. If Father knew about this---"

"He might have the right," mused Diana. "Well, he might have the right to tell Harry he needs to stay there specifically." She looked at Harry. "Those relatives needed to sign a permission form for you to spend Yule at the manor, didn't they?" He nodded. "There you go; that probably means that they're his legal guardians."

"But that's blasphemy!" Pansy exclaimed. "Some good-for-nothing muggles can't have custody of the Boy-Who-Lived! He's a cultural icon! Every child in our world knows who Harry is and he has to listen to muggles!"

"They're not even fit to lick the grime off of his boots," muttered Theodore. "Them giving him orders makes me sick."

"You should really tell Father, Harry," said Diana. "He could appeal this to the ministry and the Wizengamot. Between the two bodies, I'm sure we could get this atrocity sorted."

"Do you really think so?" Everyone nodded, but Harry still hesitated. Somehow, telling Mister Malfoy about all of this just seemed like he was taking the plunge into deep and perilous waters he may never resurface from. The man had been nothing but kind, yet he still intimidated Harry more than the boy would care to admit.

In the end, he promised nothing, though the thought now lurked seductively at the corners of his mind.

***July 27, 1992***

***Malfoy Manor***

***8:32 AM***

Mister Malfoy was in a thunderous mood the Monday morning following Harry's arrival at the manor. It was the first time the man had been anything less than either pleasant or neutral in Harry's presence, and the image was one he was not keen to see often. His visage spoke of a man who was not to be crossed and his very stare seemed to do its best to burn a hole straight through the newspaper headline that had so drawn his ire.

***WIZENGAMOT OFFICIALLY PASSES MUGGLE PROTECTION ACT!***

***By Rita Skeeter***

"At least the woman tore the Liberals down a peg," Narcissa observed.

Harry didn't understand most of the article, since he knew absolutely nothing about politics, but this Rita Skeeter had not held back on her negative opinions of the bill and those who had passed it. The extent of what he knew was that the Wizengamot was divided into three factions. The Liberals, the Neutrals, and the Conservatives. From the little he had read, he was pretty sure the Conservatives were more traditional in their views and that they were the ones who typically pushed the pro-pureblood agenda. The Liberals largely advocated for the passing of new, progressive bills, while the Neutrals took whichever stance benefited them at the time.

Harry had no doubts that was a horribly simplified and generalized description that did not at all accurately reflect the deeper workings of Magical Britain's politics, but he really wasn't that interested. He was more than content letting the adults deal with that mess while he just focused on school.

"Skeeter's quill might be sharp," said Mister Malfoy, scowling, "but it should have been a dagger. One right under the chin of Weasley, if I had my way."

"What does the bill do?" asked Draco.

"Among other ridiculous things --- all benefiting the muggles and outsiders --- it gives Weasley of all people the power to invade the privacy of upstanding citizens. I have no doubt he'll be here within the week. Trust the Liberals to get some trash like this passed." He pushed his breakfast away from him as he stood to his feet. "Pardon me for the morning, there are matters that I must see to at once."

Harry didn't see Mister Malfoy for the rest of that day. Not that he took the chance; he spent most of the rest of the day locked up in the library since the last thing he wanted was to cross paths with angry adults.

***Later that night, in the Hog's Head...***

Glasses clinked against the table as two men sitting across from one another each set theirs down.

Both men wore standard robes, though one was a normal-looking black and one was periwinkle blue.

The one in the blue robes glanced over his contemporary's shoulder towards a portrait depicting a young, blonde girl with an oddly vacant expression. The man looked strangely sad, just as he did every time the portrait was in his line of sight.

"So," began the man in normal robes, "why are we here?"

His flamboyantly dressed counterpart raised an eyebrow. "Is the bond of family not enough?"

The other man snorted. "Your games won't work on me, of all people. We met two weeks ago; we almost never meet more than once a month with your schedule and band of pandering admirers." The luridly dressed man frowned deeply, but he didn't deny the accusation. "You wanted a meeting badly and there's a reason."

His brother sighed and graced him with a fond smile. "You have never gotten the credit you deserve. I take the blame for that and am sorry for it---"

"You can keep all of the attention. Shove it somewhere unpleasant, while you're at it."

"Why must you make passing along a simple compliment so difficult?"

"Not many things are difficult for you, are they? I've got to make your life interesting somehow."

"Well, there is something else I have had great difficulty with this summer. I was hoping you might be able to be of some assistance on that front?" The other man grunted to show he was listening and the speaker withdrew a number of parchments from his robes and put them on the table between them.

"Oh, hell," cursed the man in black robes. "You can't be serious---"

"I would not bring something like this before you if I was not."

"You can take all of this to hell, Albus. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't laugh you out of the building?"

Albus Dumbledore studied his brother pensively. "Harry Potter is shaping up to be quite the masterful young mind," he said after a moment. "I just thought you might wish to be in a position to, as you might put it, make sure my meddling doesn't start another war."

Aberforth cursed aloud and downed his glass of fire whiskey. This was going to be a very *long* night.

**Book 2: The Erosion of Innocence**

**Chapter 4: Promises and Progress**

***July 30, 1992***

***Longbottom Manor***

***4:47 PM***

Raindrops fell fast, beating against the ground like hurried footsteps and assaulting all under the vengeful clouds like liquified bullets. The sky was a gloomy grey colour, not even dark enough to bring with it the promise of a storm; simply dull and lifeless. The air was thick and full of moisture, bringing with it the swarms of bugs who were attracted to such things.

None of this mattered to the lone figure who stood atop a lush green hill, peering down at the spot where his former friend now laid.

The Weasley family in its entirety had attended the funeral of Neville Longbottom. The affairs had recently concluded, but the youngest male in the contingent had asked for a moment alone.

He stood atop this hill, under a large oak tree, and peered down at the spot where the casket containing his friend was now buried by fresh, moisture-soaked earth. The grass all around his feet was wet and he could feel water seeping through his battered shoes and soaking his knitted socks, but he cared for none of it.

His attention was entirely on the ground and all the implications that were attached to the sight.

He had mostly managed to distract himself for the better part of the last month, largely with the help of Cedric and his older brothers, who had been uncharacteristically understanding --- even though they knew nothing of the circumstances which had truly led to Neville's death.

Seeing the casket lowered into the earth had brought back all the worst feelings he had experienced and all of the terrible sensations he had just barely managed to keep at bay for so long.

It was overwhelming. He felt as though a weight had been forcefully shoved down his throat. It had constricted his breathing on the way down and was now compressing his chest in all sorts of painful ways that he couldn't describe. Even that failed to account for the horrible pangs in his stomach, like someone was ringing a gong of despair deep within his innards, but it was the best analogy he had.

It was all far too much.

He couldn't cope with this, and for the first time in weeks he felt tears sting his eyes. He didn't raise his hand to wipe them away as he might have normally. He instead allowed them to flow freely down his cheeks, adding to the cascade of water drenching the ground all around him.

His shoulders began to shake as the tears came faster. Ron didn't know when he had ended up on all fours, but he supposed his legs must have given out. Not all that surprising given how much they had been shaking. He fought the urge to curl in on himself as deep, wracking sobs tore at every inch of his being.

There were people around him now, and their voices came to him as if from far away. Voices he recognized as his mother's and sister's were the most prominent, but he could hear others, too. Hands gripped him and slowly pulled him to his feet. His vision was blurred by tears, but he could make out the sombre visages of his twin brothers, who had been the ones to pull him upright.

"It's gonna be all right, Ron," one of them said, sounding more sincere than he'd ever heard as they pulled him into a tight embrace.

The other joined in, patting him on the back as his entire family converged upon him. Ron just let his body fall against the wall of flesh, trusting them to hold him upright, for his legs could no longer perform the task.

He hated this feeling.

It was worse than any he had ever felt before. Clear thought was not a luxury he was enjoying at that time, only one declaration screamed to him, echoing and reverberating off of every inch of his skull; seeming to pierce not just his ears, but his very brain.

He would do everything he could to ensure he never felt this way again.

For both his sake, and that of those like Neville, who deserved much better than they had gotten.

He had to be better.

Somewhere in the distance, in a vast field near the towering gate that marked the edge of the Longbottom's property, a shorter figure stood. He watched the huddling silhouettes standing atop the hill with an oddly blank expression. If one looked into his eyes, they would be shocked by what they saw. They carried no hint of emotion, but complete and total emptiness, as though all light behind them had been extinguished.

"Knut for your thoughts, Harry?"

The boy stiffened and slowly turned, pushing aside a great deal of hair that had become stuck to his forehead thanks to the rain, and met the gaze of a man whom he had not expected to see.

"Professor Dumbledore?"

The man was dressed in plain black robes for the occasion, which somehow looked more strange on him than his usual, flamboyant style. His eyes were less vivid than he was accustomed to. Perhaps it was just Harry's imagination, or perhaps it was the water making his half-moon spectacles appear less transparent. It was impossible to be sure.

"I thought it only right to come and pay my respects," said the old wizard. "Especially as I feel most personally responsible for the travesty we all presently grieve over."

His eyes looked past Harry and up to the top of the hill, where the Weasleys were now gently guiding a very distraught Ron away.

"A very powerful thing, death. Perhaps not quite equal to the force of love, but it touches many just as deeply. Like its counterpart, it is as terrible as it is beautiful." Dumbledore sighed. "In this case, I fear it is firmly and completely the former. Let us hope that those like young Ronald Weasley keep their eyes on the light and make the best of what they feel, for there is always hope, even in the darkest of times."

Harry just nodded; he could think of no other response appropriate for such wisdom.

When it became apparent the younger boy would not speak, Dumbledore turned back to look at Harry. "I must confess, I had not expected to see you at this gathering. Please do not take this as a lack of enthusiasm to see you, I just find myself surprised, is all. Between the two of us, it is an occurrence which doesn't happen all that often." Harry shuffled uncomfortably, painfully aware of how the headmaster had been the one who'd asked him to return to Privet Drive. "Might I assume that you are no longer residing at your aunt and uncle's?"

"I'm not, sir."

"May I ask why?"

"They... didn't treat me well."

Dumbledore's face fell. "It pains me to hear. I do hope you will consider returning to them next summer with extra precautions in place, but I will not press the matter. They are your legal guardians, but I will not condone their mistreatment of you. Perhaps in time, you will trust me enough to explain what it is that has happened."

"I hope so, sir."

Dumbledore studied him very closely. "How are you holding up, my dear boy? I have no doubt it has been a trying month for you."

"I'm... all right, sir. It was... a really hard week or two, but I had a lot of time to think about things. I... actually wasn't sure I would come here. I didn't really know Neville. What happened to him is awful, but I kind of just saw it. I wish I hadn't, but I'm sort of... numb to it now."

"A perfectly understandable reaction. You saw something so horrible I would never wish it upon anyone, regardless of their age. It is not at all surprising that you have had some difficulties processing everything. I know it must be trying, especially since the circumstances of such a thing aren't ones you can speak of with any who have not been made privy to them. If you ever have the need, I am always happy to receive correspondence from one in a position like the one you find yourself in now. Or, of course, speak more directly once the school term begins."

"Thank you, sir. It... means a lot, since I know you're so busy."

"Think nothing of it, Harry. An old man will always find the time for those who will succeed him." He checked the watch on his wrist. "Speaking of time, I am afraid it is making a fool of me once again. It was a pleasure seeing you and I apologize once more for all you have been through at such a young age. I look forward to our time together this year, but for now, I must be off."

Harry watched with the same blank numbness and ignored the way water streamed from the mop of hair over his face and glasses as Dumbledore stepped off the property and disappeared in a swirl of robes.

***That night, at Malfoy Manor...***

The day had been sombre, even though Harry was the only one in the Malfoy home truly affected by Neville's passing. It had been Narcissa and Mr. Malfoy who had encouraged Harry to attend the funeral. Narcissa had said it might help him cope with such things, while Lucius had said it would be best for his public image if he were seen at such a gathering. Harry had been more than a little bit reluctant, but he had eventually acquiesced.

He found himself in an odd headspace by the time he returned to the manor that evening. After dinner, he retreated to his room, burying himself deep in the compendium on duelling and not looking up until a soft knock on his door jolted him hours later.

"Come in."

The door opened silently and Harry found himself surprised by whom it had admitted.

"Mrs. Malfoy?"

He had been expecting Draco or even Diana. The form of their mother surprised him and the look she levelled him with froze him in place. "I have told you, Harry, to call me Narcissa. My husband might insist on formality to keep his image intact, but we are family."

"Sorry," Harry mumbled, casting his eyes around the room and away from the woman's face as he tried not to blush.

She waved a hand. "I didn't come and find you to talk about silly things like names and formalities." Harry adjusted his gaze to rest upon her once more, asking a voiceless question with his stare alone. "I came to check on you, Harry. How are you feeling?" When he looked confused, she sighed. "I know the Longbottom boy's death has bothered you more than you've let on. Your nonchalance might fool Draco, but it hasn't fooled any of the rest of us."

Harry actually did blush this time, but he got it under control in short order. "I'm okay. I... didn't really know him. It was just... a surprise. I've heard our families were allies for a long time."

That part was actually true. He had read up more on the Longbottoms after Neville's passing and it was indeed true that their two families had fought alongside one another in many of the most harrowing wars Europe had seen over the centuries. The fact also made for a good cover story in situations like this one.

"You don't need to know someone for death to affect you," said Narcissa. "It's a very scary thing for all of us, especially for someone your age. Have you ever experienced it before?" She looked pained. "Disregarding your parents, of course, since you were too young to really understand when it happened."

He shook his head. No one he had known had died whilst he'd been living with the Dursleys. None of their closely related family had either, as far as he knew. The closest thing he had come to gaining experience with death was the old cat lady, Mrs. Figg, telling him about how some of her pets had passed away over the years.

"It isn't something you can understand until it happens. It's a thing all of its own. I just want to make sure you're doing all right, because plenty of people your age don't handle it well."

"I'm doing okay, I think. It's just... weird. It still sometimes doesn't feel real, like today at the funeral." He frowned. "Can I ask you something? It's a bit... I don't know how to explain it. It's something that's been bothering me."

"Of course, dear."

"And... you won't judge me for it? Or tell anyone else?"

"There is nothing you could tell me that would make me think less of you and I won't tell a soul unless you ask me to. Not even Lucius."

He took a deep breath. "Does it... make me a bad person if I just felt... numb while looking at his grave?"

Narcissa watched him very closely. "It doesn't make you a bad person, it just means you don't live and die by emotions. People react differently to situations. You won't react like Draco to the same event, and he won't react the same way as Diana. People are complicated and we're all different. I would think that's a good sign. You said you didn't know him, so it's not an unreasonable reaction. It might just be that you're starting to come to terms with the concept."

That made a degree of sense and Harry was sure she was in some ways correct.

Of course, she also didn't know how Neville Longbottom had really died, nor what about his passing had truly been plaguing him, but those feelings were passing. Ever since his arrival at Malfoy Manor, he had begun to feel better. Whether shrugging off something so horrible made him just as bad, he sometimes questioned.

***The next day...***

The oddest part of Harry's stay at Malfoy Manor came that next day. He had hardly even remembered it was his birthday, he had become so conditioned to treating it as just another day that the idea of celebrating it seemed unnatural.

Harry's routine at Malfoy Manor was similar to his routine at Hogwarts. He would rise early and make his way down to the library, then read about duelling, or Charms, or Transfiguration, or any number of things. A house elf would usually appear in the room and announce the family was having breakfast, at which point Harry would retreat to the dining room and join them.

When he did this last part on the morning of July 31st, he was assaulted by a wall of noise as soon as he entered the room. Draco, Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle, Theodore, Cassius, Cassandra, and Diana were all present; along with both Lucius and Narcissa. A heaping breakfast had been spread out before them, and Harry suddenly realized why Narcissa had been subtly probing him about his culinary preferences since his arrival.

After breakfast, they went out to the grounds. Those interested played Quidditch while those below simply enjoyed the company of the others. It was not unlike the second day Harry had been at the manor.

The unusual parts for Harry came after they had spent most of the late morning and early afternoon outside.

Dinner was served not in the dining hall, but in a large ballroom. The day hadn't turned into a formal gathering by any means, but there were a number of people there for dinner whom Harry had never met. Lords Nott, Crabbe, and Goyle were all present, as were both Lord and Lady Parkinson. There were a few other families present as well, but only one other man really caught Harry's attention.

"Harry," introduced Narcissa, "I'd like you to meet somebody whom you ought to have known for years if things were... different. This is Regulus Black, Lord of the Founding House of Black."

The man was of average height and had a slight, athletic build. His features were sharp and aristocratic and he seemed to have a perpetually haughty look about him. His grey eyes were darker than either Draco's or Lucius's and they had a searching quality about them. The image was topped off by straight black hair that fell to his shoulders and a short, well-kept beard of the same colour.

"It's good to finally meet you, Lord Black."

"A pleasure, Harry. I hope you won't mind me cutting the formalities; I've spent most of my life using them, so it's always refreshing to talk like normal people. Please call me Regulus, while we're at it. Lord Black was my grandfather, and it's always odd to me hearing that title."

This wasn't what Harry had expected from Lord Black. He was most definitely articulate and he carried himself well, but he expected someone more like Mr. Malfoy. A clean, composed politician who stuck to formalities at all times and never let that mask slip.

"Um... yes, s---I mean, Regulus."

"I've heard your Hogwarts grades were nothing short of excellent," said Regulus. "Any subjects you favour?"

"My favourite is Defence Against the Dark Arts. I'm also probably best at it; that or Transfiguration."

"I was always partial to Defence. It was my best class by a mile and I found it the most interesting. I'm not surprised by Transfiguration being a favourite of yours, though. Your father was a genius with it and your whole family is notable in the subject." His face darkened. "So is mine, actually. It was probably my brother's best class at school."

"He's---"

"In Azkaban, yes."

Harry had heard of Sirius Black. He had murdered about a dozen muggles and a wizard named Peter Pettigrew the day after Voldemort's defeat and been sentenced to life in Azkaban. He had come up in *The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts.*

"Sorry if I brought up any bad memories."

Regulus waved an airy hand. "Not your fault; I'm the one who broached the subject. Any thoughts on duelling?"

Harry and Regulus spent quite some time talking about duelling and defensive magic in general. Harry was thoroughly outclassed in the discussion, but he sat back and absorbed all he could. Regulus had a sort of natural charisma about him that just put people at ease. Where Lucius was intimidating, Regulus was the opposite --- though Harry had no doubt that the lord of a family like the Blacks could be fearsome if the occasion called for it.

Judging by his vast knowledge of defensive and combat-focused magics, it would be a natural transition. Regulus apparently used to duel in organized competitions around the time of his Hogwarts graduation. He was the adult whom Harry spoke with most that night, and Harry couldn't help but take a natural sort of liking to the man.

Soon enough, gifts were being torn open, which was the oddest part of the whole day for Harry. Most of the presents were tokenry, but a few were interesting.

Draco had bought him a book on Quidditch tactics, likely knowing he would try out for the Slytherin team. Diana --- who had seen Harry perusing the book on duelling --- had bought him one on curses. Some of them looked... questionable, but he wasn't complaining.

Lucius and Narcissa had bought him a number of things; among them were stunning dress robes, a number of books, and a large voucher for Flourish and Blotts. Mr. Malfoy also told Harry that when they travelled to Diagon Alley, he would buy Harry a gift of his choosing. Draco had looked strange and stony after that, but Harry had thanked the man profusely, hardly able to believe his words. It was like how Dudley had been treated by Vernon and Petunia, and Harry suddenly realized exactly why Dudley had been content to go along with all of it. It was a rather nice feeling.

His favourite gifts of the lot came from the Yaxleys and Regulus. Cassandra and her father, Lord Corban Yaxley, had bought Harry a wand holster. Well... he wasn't actually sure they had bought it. He wasn't positive as to their legality, which was something Lord Yaxley --- who worked for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement --- cleared up.

"Quick-draw holsters like this are the top-of-the-line. They're perfectly legal to own and use... they're just not legal to buy."

How he had gotten his hands on one, Harry didn't ask. He didn't want to know, but he thought this might be his most useful gift --- though the one from Regulus had been impressive as well.

It was a silver chain with a tiny stamp of the crest of house Black on the clasp. Harry wondered whether or not he could remove Grindelwald's pendant from his other chain and transfer it over to this one. It would make things more practical, at the very least. Beyond its sleek, aesthetically pleasing appeal, it also had very practical usage.

"So long as you're wearing it, it will detect any poisons before you drink," said Regulus. "It's never been known to be wrong and it's not stingy about what it classifies as a poison. If it can cause you harm, the chain will warn you."

By the time Harry laid his head down upon his plush pillow that night, he could do little more than reflect about how his life had changed so drastically in the course of a year. All because of one letter and largely due to a fated meeting in a robes shop.

It was funny how things like that played out.

***August 2, 1992***

***Malfoy Manor***

***7:51 AM***

Harry made his way down to the dining room earlier than usual the Sunday after his twelfth birthday. He usually waited for a full family breakfast, but such things seldom happened on Sundays, from what he could tell. It was the day the Wizengamot met every week, so Mr. Malfoy always had to leave without time for things like family meals.

Harry had been told from the day he'd arrived at the manor to just call for an elf named Dobby if he needed or wanted anything. He had, thus far, abstained as the elf gave him odd vibes. It was typically rare they saw the elves at all, but Dobby was an exception. The creature was hard to mistake, what with his bulging, tennis ball-like eyes. Harry had caught the house elf watching him from around corners on more than one occasion. He had considered telling Mr. Malfoy but he really didn't care enough to cause a fuss.

This morning though, he decided to call upon Dobby for the first time. The elf appeared instantly but looked extremely skittish. He wouldn't meet Harry's eyes and he was practically bouncing with nervous energy. When Harry made his request for an early breakfast, the elf popped away at once, and Harry found breakfast was served only a few minutes later.

He propped up both the compendium on duelling from the Malfoy family library, as well as the book on curses Diana had gifted him just days earlier and read as he ate.

"Are you interested in duelling?"

The cool voice came from the room's entrance not terribly long after Harry had started eating. He looked up, startled, but it was only Mr. Malfoy. He was bedecked in his plum, Wizengamot robes and was obviously on his way to the meeting. He probably planned to use the floo; the closest fireplace was through the dining room and down the next corridor.

"I'm interested in Defence Against the Dark Arts and magic in general, really, but yeah. It... sort of came to my mind after we talked about the older Slytherins."

"It's a perfectly wise pursuit," the man complimented. "Have you tried any of the spells you've read about?"

"A few, yeah."

"Have you had trouble with any of them?" Harry shook his head and Mr. Malfoy studied him very closely. "Would you like to learn to duel? Really learn to duel, I mean. Learn from those who are skilled in the art?"

"I would, yeah. I like learning about magic in general, like I said, but duelling would be a useful thing to get good at."

Mr. Malfoy's expression became a touch more stern. "If I arranged for this to happen, could I be sure you would be one hundred percent committed to doing your absolute best to improve?"

Harry's eyes widened but he nodded hastily. "Of course, sir."

The man nodded. "Consider it done then. I believe you met Corban Yaxley on the night of your birthday?" Harry nodded again. "His family is well-known for being highly proficient duellists. I will get into contact with him. I am sure either he or his daughter will be adequate."

Harry raised his eyebrows; Cassie was one of the pretty, popular girls in Slytherin. She hadn't struck Harry as a master duellist. "Is Cassie actually that good, sir?"

Mr. Malfoy's lips twitched upwards. "It is no coincidence she was made a prefect this year. She has boasted some of the highest Defence Against the Dark Arts grades that the school has seen in quite some time. At present, she would easily best most fully grown witches or wizards, though she would struggle against some of the more skilled in the art of combat. By the time she graduates, I doubt many in the country would wish to cross wands with her."

From Mr. Malfoy of all people, that was extremely high praise.

"Thank you, sir," said Harry. "I... really appreciate everything you've done for me."

The man smiled. "Think nothing of it. For all the wrong our world seems to have done you, it is only right someone atones for it. I also happen to find you a very pleasant young man whom I think will go far in time. Now, if you will excuse me, I must be off."

***That night, at the Burrow...***

A door slid quietly open on the top floor of the Burrow and a tall, gangly boy stepped outside. He wasn't the most fleet-footed individual, but he did do his best to creep along quietly; taking particular care to avoid stepping on the number of creaky stairs as he made his way down to the home's ground floor. Both of his parents were snoring away and were each heavy sleepers, but Ron didn't want to take the chance.

Once he had gotten downstairs, he quietly snuck out the back door and stepped out onto the property, making his way towards a bit of land just off of the orchard that wasn't easily spotted from any of the Burrow's windows.

He had vowed to get better the day of Neville's funeral, and it was a vow he planned to keep. He had actually approached Percy for help for what might have been the first time in living memory. He had done his best to subtly inquire about the Trace and had, to his mild fury, learned that the ministry couldn't possibly know if he had cast magic whilst at the Burrow. His parents had never explained this and it didn't take a genius to know why. They would absolutely not have allowed any of their children to practice magic out of school, but Ron was about to take that decision out of their hands.

Percy had begun to grow suspicious near the end of their discussion, so Ron had instead probed him about good books for learning defensive magic. This had surprised his elder brother so much that he had appeared to forget that he was suspicious and had even let Ron borrow a number of books from his personal collection; though he did make his younger brother promise to handle them with great care.

On his way outside, Ron nearly bumped into another figure. He drew his wand hastily but froze at the sight of who it was, absolutely dumbstruck.

"Ginny!"

"Shh!" she hissed, glancing all around to make sure they were alone. "Shut up, you dolt; you'll get the both of us caught."

"What the hell are you doing here?"

"I could ask you the same thing."

They glared at one another. "Fine," said Ron, "I'll tell you what I'm doing if you tell me what you're doing."

Ginny hesitated, but nodded. "Only if you go first."

Ron rolled his eyes and muttered something about kid sisters. "I'm sneaking out to practice magic."

Ginny's eyes widened. "Won't you be caught?"

"Nah, apparently the Trace only tells them where magic's been cast."

Ginny looked thunderous. "So Mum and Dad have lied to us this whole time!"

"Uh... not really," Ron said, shifting uncomfortably. "They never lied, they just didn't tell us. I just don't think they want us practicing. Makes it a bit easier for them if we don't know we can practice in the first place."

Ginny huffed, but Ron was looking at her expectantly, so she sighed. "If you must know, I've been sneaking out and stealing the twins' brooms to practice flying, since Mum never lets me fly with you guys."

Ron's mouth fell open. "You've been stealing---"

"Yes, Ron! That's what I just said!"

The two of them stared at one another. Then, Ron's face split into a wide grin. "Nice going, Gin," he said, raising his hand for a fist bump. His sister's eyes had widened with surprise, but she reciprocated. "That's clever; didn't think you had it in you."

Despite herself, Ginny smiled. "Thanks, Ron. I'm... uh, gonna go in and sleep now. Good luck with your practice."

Ron's focus reaffirmed as the two of them parted ways and thoughts of Neville and his own failure resurfaced. Still, it had been an interesting night and he would never quite be able to look at his not-so-innocent little sister the same way again.

**Author's Endnote:**

**Just in case it reads like the contrary is true, I am absolutely not going to bash Molly or Arthur. Molly is an overbearing mother, which is why she won't let her kids practice magic. This isn't bashing, as it is basically just her canon character and I have no plans of hyperbolizing the fact. It does not make her a bad person or even a bad mother. She has no ulterior motives and is just trying to keep her kids safe.**

***Nott Manor***

***6:13 PM***

There was a heavy silence at the table that night in the dining hall of Nott Manor. Harry would have hoped his first-ever stay at Theodore's ancestral family home would have been for a more cheerful occasion, but that was not the case.

The Muggle Protection Act Mr. Malfoy had ranted about the week previous had come into effect and sure enough, Arthur Weasley had come calling --- joined by several HIT wizards. The Malfoy parents had told their three charges in no uncertain terms to floo to the home of Lord Tiberius Nott and remain there for the evening while the raid was underway.

"It makes me sick," spat Lord Nott. "Blood traitors able to pillage the home of noble, upstanding citizens who helped build this country."

"How are they able to do that in the first place?" Harry asked, vaguely remembering something about protecting muggles.

"Because the law prohibits the ownership of a list of items longer than the Chudley Cannons\' last losing streak that are all '*dangerous'*." The man drew air quotes around the final word and sneered. "Fat lot of good it will do. It's not as if the ministry has let us put any of those items to use in the past fifty or so years as it is. It's nothing but an excuse to take power away from the noble and pass it onto the blood traitors and mudbloods."

Harry had never heard that last term, but he could guess well enough at its meaning and he wasn't sure he liked it. Muggles could burn, as far as he was concerned, but he had no quarrels with muggleborns. So long as they conducted themselves in a respectful manner, Harry had no problems with them.

Despite this, he didn't dare to say anything. Not after Theodore's father had so graciously opened his home to them on such short notice.

He did agree that the bill was nonsense though, judging by the very little he knew.

Why did the muggles need protecting? The two worlds were forced so far apart, it shouldn't have mattered, should it? It wasn't as though muggles didn't have their own weapons. And so what if Harry's opinion was coloured by a touch of bias? He was sure the same was true for the other side as well.

He could practically feel Grindelwald's pendant burning a hole in his chest. He had strung it onto the chain Regulus had gifted him with, but its properties remained the same. He didn't understand why wizards felt the need to protect muggles, but he also failed to understand why they hated muggleborns so deeply.

It was a dichotomy that puzzled him, and Harry had no doubt that the one-time dark lord would have answers.

He just wasn't entirely sure whether or not he was curious enough to dare ask for them.

In the end, he decided that he would not, in fact, dare.

***August 9, 1992***

***Malfoy Manor***

***6:42 PM***

Harry winced as he shifted in his chair at the Malfoy's dining-room table. Every muscle in his body seemed to ache and protest to his every motion. He could never remember a time in his life when he had been so sore.

Yesterday, he'd had his first lesson in duelling. Lord Corban Yaxley had agreed to teach him. He would tutor Harry directly every Saturday and Sunday until the end of the summer. During the week, Harry would be given a list of spells to practice and drills to complete each day as Lord Yaxley would be occupied with his job at the ministry.

He had completed his second lesson only hours ago and it had left him wincing. The first had consisted mostly of Harry's knowledge and form being tested, but it had ended in a mock duel that had left the Slytherin youth battered and bruised. Another mock duel had opened their practice today. Harry could tell the older man was taking it very easy on him, but he still battered him around easily. He wondered how many years it would take before he could make up that differential in skill.

Harry wasn't sure what made him want to keep going. He knew that, rationally, most children his age would probably have given up --- citing the brutality of these lessons as more than a valid reason for doing so. He oddly enjoyed it. Not the getting knocked around part, but the learning. He felt as though he had learned more in those two lessons than he had in months of Defence Against the Dark Arts lessons at Hogwarts. Quirrell --- or Voldemort, he supposed, as uncomfortable as that thought made him --- had been a good teacher, but this was a different type of lesson. Without other students, Yaxley could give Harry his full attention, which the young Slytherin was quickly learning meant rapid and meaningful results.

Harry wasn't the only one at the table who looked tired. Draco's father hadn't only had the weekly Wizengamot meeting to attend that morning, but he had also just returned from a meeting of the Hogwarts Board of Governors. They were beginning their own weekly meetings once more in preparation for the start of another school year.

"Who's the Defence teacher going to be, Father?" asked Draco.

Mr. Malfoy scowled. "That is the question, isn't it?" Harry was surprised by the uncharacteristic amount of frustration in the man's voice. "Dumbledore provided a mandatory update at the end of last month, but it was of little help. He had invited Gilderoy Lockhart to take the position, but he turned the offer down."

"Of course he did," scoffed Diana. "He's making more money selling books than he would as a professor and with all he's done, the post seems beneath him."

"With all he has claimed to have done," Mr. Malfoy said coolly.

"Do you think he's lying?" Draco asked, leaning forward in his chair.

Mr. Malfoy took a languid sip of wine before he answered. "As a student at Hogwarts, Gilderoy Lockhart was far from impressive. He started school after I had already graduated, but I still had ears in the castle. All accounts of him at that time point to him being a pompous fool who hardly knew one end of a wand from another."

"He could have improved after graduation though, couldn't he?" asked Diana.

"Of course he could have, but I don't think it likely he reached the mythical levels he writes about in his books. It's far more likely that the man is a brilliant novelist with impressive creativity and a flair for the dramatics. If I'm right, I personally commend him on making so much out of so little and wish him all the best."

"If you're right though," mused Diana, "that also explains why he didn't take the position at Hogwarts. It would have exposed him as a fraud."

"Precisely."

"You don't know who's going to be our teacher though?" Draco pressed.

Harry had to resist the urge to pull back. It was so odd having adults eat with him who were willing to answer questions. Aunt Petunia's screechings about not asking questions seemed to echo painfully off the inside of his skull as he waited for Mr. Malfoy to answer.

"We haven't the foggiest of ideas. Dumbledore insists no one else has taken the job." Lucius's face twisted into a sneer shockingly reminiscent of the one his son frequented. "It's all stalling, of course. I have no doubt Dumbledore has already found his man and is just waiting until the last week of summer to make his choice known."

"Why would he do that?" Harry asked timidly, finally allowing his curiosity to override his sense of self-preservation. His heartbeat quickened as Mr. Malfoy turned towards him.

"Because he probably doubts whomever he has chosen would meet the board's standards. Hardly a surprise, given the riff-raff he has subjected the students to over the years. It's a clever ploy, actually, but then again, Dumbledore always enjoys his games."

Harry was sure no matter who taught them the class, it would feel like a step down from both Voldemort --- as much as the thought made him shudder --- and Yaxley. Whomever it was, he just hoped they were competent. He would hate to squander a year of learning in his favourite subject.

***August 19, 1992***

***Diagon Alley***

***10:54 AM***

Hogwarts letters had arrived exactly a week ago, and with them had come the perfunctory lists of books and supplies needed for the upcoming school year. The book assigned for Defence Against the Dark Arts was relatively generic and gave off no real hint as to who the professor might be. Funnily enough, Draco had taken a harsh anti-Lockhart stance ever since his father had speculated about the man. He had told Harry with complete confidence that had Lockhart been their professor, the 'egotistical git' would have assigned all of his own books.

His rantings weren't completely uncalled for, as the very man in question was holding a book signing at Flourish and Blotts the same day they were set to do their shopping. Mr. Malfoy had been less than pleased by the inconvenience, but they hadn't rescheduled.

They travelled to Diagon Alley via floo powder. Harry had only ever read about the form of transportation. He could comfortably say after almost falling head-first out of the Leaky Cauldron's fireplace that he would have had no objections to keeping it that way. He had been spinning so fast that he hadn't been able to see straight for over a minute upon his arrival. Worse still, he had spent the entire journey wanting to vomit. Not because of the spinning, but because of the way fireplaces, living rooms, and all sorts of other things blurred past his eyes so fast that his brain seemed to just give up.

He blinked after stepping out into Diagon Alley proper alongside Mr. Malfoy, his son, and his daughter. It was a normal, cloudy day, but it seemed to Harry's eyes like an onslaught of light after the dimly lit pub they had landed in.

"I have a stop to make before we do your shopping," said Mr. Malfoy. "Harry, Draco, stay with me. Diana, you can come or go as you like, so long as you are careful."

"Thank you, Father. I'll go meet up with my friends at Madam Malkin's."

Mr. Malfoy fished a bag of golden galleons from his robes and passed it to his daughter. "Enjoy yourself." Diana waved as she made her way off towards the robes shop in question.

Mr. Malfoy did not lead Harry and Draco towards Gringotts, as Harry had somewhat expected. He instead led them towards a place Harry had never noticed before.

It was a long, twisting alleyway that looked much emptier than its larger, more populated counterpart. Much quieter, too. Almost eerily quiet in a way that made the hairs on the back of Harry's neck stand on end. Many of the shops here were... different. A few of them had boarded windows and a larger number had chipped paint. Some were maintained very well, but even several of those put Harry on edge.

Many of the windows displayed things much different than what Harry had seen in Diagon Alley a year ago. There were things like swords and daggers, some of which were still dripping with sickening green poison, or worse. Several shop windows had what appeared to be bones on display; while one had a strange-looking limb that mercifully didn't seem to be human. One, however, proudly displayed what was beyond doubt a human skull. The bones were so white, Harry thought they must have been bleached. Or, he supposed, cleaned via magical means.

The most normal things on display were books, but even some of these were odd in gut twistingly grim ways. Some of them, Harry would swear, looked as though they were lined with human skin, and more than one had deep, red stains that looked unmistakably like blood.

"Not the most charming place, is it?" Mr. Malfoy asked, watching Harry closely as the youth's eyes roamed around the alley.

He shook his head. "It's a bit..." he trailed off, casting about for an appropriate adjective.

"Grim?" Draco's father supplied. "Dark, needlessly edgy, excessively melodramatic?" Harry nodded. "This, Harry, is Knockturn Alley. They're not marketing to their customers. We know what to expect from their services. The place may look like it\'s run by scum --- and that isn't completely untrue --- but it offers services which can't be readily found anywhere else. The... colourful displays are to draw the attention of impressionable young minds who are less educated."

"Mr. Malfoy, sir, how much of what's on display is... legal?"

The man raised an eyebrow. "How much does the answer matter to you?"

"It doesn't, really," Harry rushed to assure him, and he meant it. He knew some of the older Slytherins had plenty of books and other things that weren't legal. Some of them Harry had interacted with and just because they owned things that were frowned upon, didn't mean they were bad people. "I just wondered why the ministry doesn't raid this place if they're raiding family manors?"

Lucius's lips curved upwards into an oddly cruel smile. "A good question, but a complicated answer. Politics has much to do with it, but I won't bore you with those nuances. What you might find satisfactory an answer is that, if the ministry shut down Knockturn Alley, they would have a warzone for lowlife thugs, as well as more dangerous frequenters."

Harry felt like he was missing a lot of context in what Mr. Malfoy had just said, but he noted it for later thought and nodded.

"Come along," the man continued, "I don't wish to be here for too much time."

They followed the Malfoy patriarch down the twisting street, ignoring a number of predatory-looking hags as they went, until they came to an unremarkable-looking building. It had a shrivelled head in the window, along with a number of other, ancient-looking trinkets that Mr. Malfoy seemed to completely ignore as he pushed the door open and ushered the two boys in before him.

The shop was deceptively large. Harry would never have thought by the exterior that the inside could have been as vast as it was. He idly remembered the enchantment that allowed his trunk to hold more books and items than it should have been able to and wondered if this was just that on a grander scale.

Delicate shelves lined the low-ceilinged building, many of them caked in a thick layer of dust. It was dark and gloomy, with the only source of light coming from outside; and even that was obscured by a thick layer of grime on the inside of the window. Harry wondered whether or not that was a deliberate attempt to stop passersby from spotting more than what was on display.

A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a blood-stained pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Draco cast his eyes around the dimly lit shop and quickly bustled towards and bent over a shelf of skulls.

"Mr. Malfoy," came a voice so oily Harry almost cringed, "what a pleasure to see you again. Delighted --- and young Master Malfoy, too --- charmed." The new arrival was now standing behind the desk, though he hadn't appeared to be present a moment ago. He was stooping and had long, greasy hair that looked most unkempt. He pushed it back out of his face and studied Harry with dark, curious eyes. "And who is this?" he asked.

"Harry Potter, if you must know. He is a friend of my son's and has accompanied us today." Mr. Malfoy levelled Borgin --- whose eyes had grown wide and hungry-looking --- with an intense glare. "And I will have you know, Borgin, that if so much as a word of his presence here today gets spread about, you will be hearing from associates of mine under much less pleasant pretences."

"Of course, Mr. Malfoy, sir. I would never dream of spreading family secrets about. I always say that along with the services we provide, our patrons pay for discretion."

Mr. Malfoy sneered. "It would explain some of the pricing."

"Yes, well, what can I help you with today?" asked Borgin. "I must show you, just in today, we have---"

"I am here to sell, Borgin," Mr. Malfoy cut in. "I have no plans of buying anything here."

"But Father," Draco spoke up, "you said Harry and I could both have gifts!"

It was true. Lucius had promised Harry he would buy him anything on this shopping trip. Draco had looked most unhappy about that, so Lucius had appeased his son with a similar promise.

Mr. Malfoy's eyes narrowed upon his son. "Not quite, Draco. I told Harry I would buy him a gift of his choosing. If his item of choice so happens to be from here, I suppose I will, in fact, be buying." His lip curled in a way that would have made their Head of House proud. "I did not make you the same promise. I said that you could have a racing broom." Mr. Malfoy turned to Harry. "Have a look around, if you'd like. I'm not sure you'll find anything of interest here, but they do occasionally have worthwhile trinkets if you know what you're looking for."

Harry hastened to obey and began scanning the shop with vigour while Lucius began discussing the details of his prospective sale with Mr. Borgin.

Harry found himself oddly fascinated by this place. It was unlike anywhere else he had ever seen. Many of the artifacts on display were said to carry horrific curses the likes of which Harry had never even imagined. Some of them made his skin crawl, but others piqued his interest in a way he wasn't sure was normal. Much like his reaction to seeing his former classmate's casket lowered into the earth, this made Harry question whether or not he might not be such a great person.

"Merlin," muttered Draco, "Harry, come look at this!"

Harry made his way over towards Draco, who was looking at a shelf that seemed to be reserved for high-value goods. Much of what it held were books, but there were some extremely old-looking things, too. What Draco was gawking at admittedly caught Harry's attention as well.

Atop a pillow that was a deep shade of royal purple sat a slightly tarnished ring of deep, dark silver. It was accented with gold, which also made up the effigy in its centre. Sitting on some kind of ornate chair was a man who appeared to Harry as maybe being a knight. His head was held high and he held aloft a sword in one hand and a sceptre in the other.

Even while clearly aged, the ring was stunning --- but it wasn't what caught Harry's attention. That was attributed to the label right underneath it.

*King John's Long-Lost Ring!*

"Ah," crooned Mr. Borgin, who had apparently concluded his business with Draco's father. "A man of great taste, I see."

Lucius strolled over and stared down. His eyebrows rose. "An impressive find," he told Borgin. "This artifact has been thought lost for centuries."

Borgin smiled thinly. "We were very proud of it. All sorts of rumours about its magical properties over the years, but no one's quite sure what it does. Definitely imbued with magic of some sort. You can practically feel it when you hold the thing." The man looked towards Harry with a gleam in his eye. "Are you interested in the ring, Master Potter?"

He really was. Beyond its stunning aesthetic, Harry had always enjoyed history. He had read about King John and the Magna Carta long before Hogwarts. He was sure the real history was different, seeing as wizards were likely involved since that debacle took place nearly five hundred years before the implementation of the Statute of Secrecy. The artifact just called to Harry in an odd sort of way, but the price tag had his eyes practically bulging out of his head.

"A touch pricey," Mr. Malfoy observed. "More than worth it if it is indeed the real thing, of course." He turned to Borgin. "If Mister Potter wants the ring, would you object to an examination of it by an expert?"

"Not at all, sir. We are very confident in our find."

"I'm sure. Forgive me if I do not share the same degree of confidence." He glanced towards Harry. "Is this what you would like?"

"If... if that's okay, sir. I know it's expensive---"

Mr. Malfoy waved his hand. "Our final stop today will already be a costly one. I had not planned for today to be a cheap outing, so it is most alright." He turned back to Borgin. "I will have someone come by in the coming days to examine the ring. Should they prove its authenticity, you have made yourself a sale."

Harry and the Malfoy males departed Knockturn Alley after their trip into Borgin and Burkes and spent the rest of their time in the more densely populated Diagon Alley. Harry had expected them to head to Gringotts, but they didn't. Mr. Malfoy said he would buy Harry's school things and provide him with money for the upcoming year at Hogwarts. A year ago, Harry thought he would have politely turned him down. After spending a year in Slytherin, he knew enough not to look a gift horse in the mouth, so he accepted Mr. Malfoy's offer with much grace.

After stops at Slug and Jiggers, Madam Malkin's, and Scribbulus Writing Supplies, they neared the queue outside of Flourish and Blotts. Lucius's eyes scanned the crowd and quickly picked out Diana with her friends. He strode confidently through the bustling queue of what seemed mostly to be middle-aged witches and came up beside his daughter.

"Come," he told her and her friends, "we need not wait out here with the commoners."

He led them all up to the main entrance which was guarded by a couple of Auror trainees. Mr. Malfoy conversed with them politely for a minute or so and was quickly let through. Harry blinked, hardly able to believe how easy it had been. He hadn't even seen any gold change hands.

Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view as they advanced further into the shop, seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard's hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair.

A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash. Draco snickered and quietly pointed to Ron Weasley, who the man had just rudely shoved aside. Harry plastered a fake smile onto his lips, but he didn't much care. He neither liked nor disliked Weasley, but he had a hard time ridding himself of the image of the boy and his family standing atop the hill at Longbottom's funeral.

"Harry," said Mr. Malfoy in a low voice, eyes fixed on Lockhart at the front of the room. "I was wondering whether I might ask a favour of you?"

Harry looked up at the man with wide eyes. "Of course, sir." It wasn't as if he was going to say no after the unceasing kindness the man had shown him today.

"I think I might steal a picture with Mr. Lockhart. His reputation would do me wonders after the slander the *Prophet's* been posting since Weasley's meddling." Harry winced; the *Daily Prophet* had posted the names of all families who had been raided, and the Malfoys had not been spared. "I was wondering whether you might be agreeable to joining me?"

The rest went unsaid. Harry was the Boy-Who-Lived. There had been articles written about him after his sorting into Slytherin, for Merlin's sake. Even after that, they had sung his praises, spinning it into a tale of how he might reinvent the house's reputation. If Mr. Malfoy was seen with Harry Potter so soon after the aspersions cast upon him by Arthur Weasley and the *Daily Prophet*, all would be forgotten.

Harry didn't much like the idea of posing for a newspaper, nor standing in front of the whole crowd of people with a fake smile on his face. But for a man who had shown him so much kindness ever since they had met...

"It's no trouble, sir. Anything I can do to help."

Lucius smiled and rested a hand on Harry's shoulder, guiding him up towards where Gilderoy Lockhart was still signing autographs. The crowd burst into loud murmurs at the sight of Harry --- who was impossible to miss --- walking alongside one of the most prominent men in the country. Lockhart clearly heard the whispers, for he looked up and his eyes landed on the both of them.

"It can't be Harry Potter?"

The remaining crowd parted, whispering excitedly. Lockhart looked like he wanted to dive forward and seize Harry's arm, but he restrained himself after seeing that Lucius was with him.

"Good afternoon, Gilderoy," said Mr. Malfoy with a small inclination of his head.

"Ah, Lucius, old chap! So long it's been!" Harry was pretty sure the two of them had never interacted before. If they had, Lockhart was certainly not close enough to the Malfoy lord to call him by his first name.

Mr. Malfoy just smiled along. "Indeed it has. My ward here just wanted to meet you, so I thought it only right if I gave him the opportunity. He's enthralled by your books, you see?"

Lockhart beamed with the force of a miniature sun. "Of course, of course! And I'll be happy to give the lad the whole set, signed and free of charge!"

Harry and Lucius were now standing at the front of the room with Lockhart, who took to his feet and stood on Harry's right. The boy now stood between Lucius and Gilderoy, with the former's hand on his shoulder and the latter's arm draped around him. This last motion made him tense, but he forced himself to relax as the cameraman rushed forward.

"Nice big smile, Harry," said Lockhart through gleaming teeth. "Together, you and I are worth the front page."

Harry thought that comment might have made it much easier for Mr. Malfoy to fake his own winning smile.

***August 31, 1992***

***Malfoy Manor***

***7:44 PM***

They had indeed made the front page, but that had been nearly two weeks ago now.

It was the night before yet another year at Hogwarts would begin and Harry felt strange. He loved the castle more than anywhere else in the world and in many ways, he wanted nothing more than to return to it. But he had also loved Malfoy Manor in a different form altogether. The freedom it had provided him was something he had never experienced before and the kindness shown to him by the Malfoys was something he could have never imagined.

Yet that kindness to him didn't make Harry's current course of action any less intimidating.

Draco and Diana had been trying to convince Harry for weeks to tell their father about the Dursleys, convinced that the man could do something about it.

Finally, with less than twenty-four hours until he was set to board the Hogwarts Express, Harry acquiesced. It was a combination of their persistence, his desperation to never return to Privet Drive, and the shopping trip that convinced him. The way Mr. Malfoy had treated him during that trip and the way the man had carried himself... it just inspired a great deal of confidence and Harry thought himself ready to take the plunge.

He very hesitantly knocked on the door to Mr. Malfoy's study, hoping he wasn't interrupting anything. It was one of the most heavily warded rooms in the home, according to Draco. He'd said he had only ever been in that room on a few scarce occasions.

"Who is it?" came Mr. Malfoy's voice.

"It's Harry, sir."

A pause, and then...

"Enter."

The door opened of its own accord when Mr. Malfoy spoke, and Harry saw him pushing a pile of parchments to the side as he looked up.

"Good evening, Harry. Is there something I can help you with?" His eyes watched him intently, noticing the way the boy had suddenly become quite fidgety.

"I... maybe, sir. There's... something I've been working up to telling you for a long time. Something Draco and Diana have been trying to get me to tell you."

The man raised an eyebrow. "Come and sit," he said, gesturing to the plush armchair across from him. Harry did so and the door closed on its own as he walked further into the room. "What is it you wish to tell me?"

"You... remember how I said I used magic when I left my relatives' house?" Thankfully, Mr. Malfoy had gotten that warning revoked within the first week of his stay, as he had promised.

The man's eyes darkened. "May I presume I'm about to hear exactly why you did such a thing?"

"Yes, sir."

Harry took a deep, centring breath and then began to rattle off how the Dursleys had locked him in his room the night after he had arrived on Privet Drive. Sometime during the tale, it devolved into Harry telling Lucius about how they had locked him in a boot cupboard as a child, forced him to do chores, and even punished him with occasional bouts of physical violence.

By the time Harry was done, he was shaking. Not quite at the point of becoming teary-eyed, but shaky and not at all in a calm state of mind.

"Calm down, Harry." The man's voice was softer and gentler than Harry had ever heard it before. "Nothing that happened is your fault and it is nothing you should feel ashamed of. It is the fault of the filthy animals who locked you away, and it is the fault of our pathetic system for allowing any child to be raised by such creatures."

"I just... please, sir. Can... can you not tell anyone about this?"

Mr. Malfoy's features softened. "I'll need to tell a few people if we are to resolve this atrocity."

"R-resolve it, sir?"

The man's jaw clenched. "Yes, Harry, resolve it. I will need to gather evidence and such, but you are never returning to the rabble who raised you. I am going to make sure of that --- I swear it to you."

"Does... does that mean everyone is going to know about what happened, sir?"

"If I have my way, the affairs will take place in a low-key manner and behind closed doors." His eyes gleamed. "And between the two of us, Harry, us Malfoys almost always get our way."

"Thank you, sir," said Harry, unable to say anything more.

Mr. Malfoy stood from behind the desk and made his way over to Harry, resting a firm and steady hand on his shoulder as he bent down to look him square in the eyes.

"You are part of our world now. More so, you are family, in a sense. I promise you, nothing is going to take you away from either of those two things. I will make sure of it, by any means necessary."

**Author's Endnote:**

**Just a note on the ring: It will not be giving Harry any kind of superpower that is going to win him fights or resolve major plots. It does have a function that will doubtlessly come in handy at some point, but it is not going to be a major advantage going forward. Honestly, the ring exists largely so I can expand on some magical history that will be semi-relevant to the story way down the line.**

**Chapter 6: Warnings and Welcomes**

***September 1, 1992***

***Malfoy Manor***

***5:02 AM***

Harry awoke with a jolt on the morning of September 1st and assumed for a moment that his excitement had simply gotten the better of him. The lack of light streaming into the room despite one of the four walls consisting entirely of glass indicated exactly how early it was. He typically rose before the sun had fully risen, but it had barely started peeking out over the horizon. There wasn't even a tinge of sunlight visible in the sky yet, and the stars were still shining as brightly as ever.

Excitement pulling him back into the realm of consciousness wouldn't have been terribly hard to believe --- a similar thing had happened last year; yet he quickly realized that no emotion was responsible for his early and sudden start to the day.

He felt an odd weight on his lower body as if something was attempting to pin him down. It wasn't doing a very good job of it, he could still move without a great deal of difficulty.

He sat bolt upright when he looked towards his legs and saw large green eyes. He had to resist the urge to cry out, not wanting to wake the rest of the house. Among them, he was by far the earliest riser and it would not do to disturb his hosts so unjustly.

He scrambled backwards, jerking his legs in an attempt to dislodge the creature and snatched his wand from underneath his pillow before taking aim at the shape which was now slowly rising off the floor.

"It's Dobby, sir," came a high voice that was obviously putting in an awful attempt at whispering.

Harry glared at the creature and did not lower his wand. "Why are you in my room and watching me sleep then?" he demanded in a hissing voice that was much quieter than the elf's attempts at a whisper.

The creature shuffled and cast its gaze to the floor. "Dobby didn't mean to scare Harry Potter, sir. Dobby would never... Harry Potter is a great wizard."

His glare did not relent. "Well, what were you doing then?"

"Dobby just wanted to talk to Harry Potter, sir. Talk was all... Dobby must warn him."

"Warn me of what?"

Unless Voldemort made another bid for power that somehow centred around Hogwarts yet again, Harry felt reasonably confident nothing this year could possibly top the death of a fellow student and his own kidnapping at the hands of a long vanquished dark lord.

Dobby cast his eyes around the room as if afraid someone was listening. "It... it is difficult, sir. Dobby... Dobby wonders where to begin..."

"At the beginning, maybe?" Harry suggested. When the elf began to fidget even more, Harry's eyes narrowed. "Dobby, should you even be here right now?"

"Oh, no, sir, no . . . Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this. If they ever knew, sir."

Harry wasn't sure how to feel about that last comment. He had no idea whether or not the Malfoys treated their elves so cruelly, but he thought they might have. Draco certainly seemed to view them as little more than animals. From what Harry had seen so far, he was hard-pressed to disagree. They seemed to exist simply to serve the whims of wizards. Diana had even told him something of the sort when he'd asked what the creatures were not long after arriving.

*"They're called house elves,"* she had told him. *"They're a sort of magical creature that has existed for as long as anyone remembers. If there are any records of how they came to be, I haven't seen them. They're not like witches and wizards. They have their own kind of magic that's dependent on us. They get bonded to a family and rely on them. They need to be serving witches or wizards for them to keep their magic. They're sort of just built for it; they even enjoy it."*

If this was true, Harry found it most odd that this particular elf seemed to be at least indirectly disobeying orders from the Malfoys. He wondered if the way the creature had subtly watched him over the summer had fallen into a similar sort of vein. Perhaps that was why the creature had been punishing itself so horrendously.

Harry eventually decided he cared more about answers than the moral questions bumping around inside his head. Last year had taught him that those were extremely taxing and never seemed to yield results. It was also much too early for thoughts so deep and complex.

"The warning?" he prompted.

The elf took a deep, centring breath. "Harry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great, too good to lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal danger."

Silence stretched between them as Harry's jaw slowly lowered. Even during his confrontation with Voldemort, he had never really felt as though he was at risk of dying.

"You want me to stay here?" he asked, shaking his head. "Dobby, even if I wanted to stay here, the Malfoys would never let me. They'd send me to Hogwarts, like they should. Hogwarts is where I belong; it's where I need to be."

"No! No! No!" Dobby argued, stamping his little feet to punctuate each word. "Harry Potter mustn't go back, sir. He *mustn't*... no matter what."

"Why not, Dobby?"

"There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year," whispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over. "Dobby has known it for months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is too important, sir!"

"What terrible things?" Harry asked at once. "Who's plotting them?"

Dobby made a funny choking noise and then sprinted towards the wall. Harry knew enough about house elves by now --- and suspected enough about Dobby --- to realize what he was about to do.

"Impedimenta."

His hastily whispered jinx hit Dobby in the back, causing the elf to freeze in mid-stride. The effect would only last a few seconds, but it gave Harry enough time to scramble to his feet, grab ahold of the house elf, and haul him back away from the wall.

That had been one of the more recent spells Yaxley had shown him. It was simple, but technically not covered until fourth-year Defence Against the Dark Arts. Harry found this irritating, since it really wasn't difficult to cast. It just so happened that they didn't learn about jinxes, hexes, and curses in any depth until fourth year, according to Yaxley.

"Dobby," Harry asked very slowly, eyes narrowing upon the elf who still looked deadly serious. "This hasn't got anything to do with Voldemort, does it?"

He could think of no other wizard who would strike fear like this, least of all fear that would prompt Dobby to warn him.

The elf clasped his hands tightly over his ears. "Speak not the name, sir, speak not the name!"

"Sorry," Harry said, not meaning it one bit, "this doesn't have anything to do with the Dark Lord, does it?"

Dobby seemed to search for the right words. "Not... not him, sir..."

But Dobby's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a hint. Harry, however, was completely lost.

"Well then, I can't think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts. I mean, there's Dumbledore, for one thing."

Dobby bowed his head. "Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore's powers rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength. But, sir..." Dobby's voice dropped to an urgent whisper. "There are powers Dumbledore doesn't... powers no decent wizard..."

A floorboard creaked out in the corridor and Dobby froze, his eyes bulging for a moment before he popped away. The elf had obviously been worried the footsteps belonged to one of his masters. Harry thought it much more likely that one of the other elves was simply doing their duty, but of course it was impossible to tell.

The only thing he knew was that he was thoroughly confused and very torn on whether or not to tell Mr. Malfoy exactly what had just transpired.

***Hours later...***

Harry had decided not to tell any of the Malfoys so long as Dobby didn't directly interfere in his affairs. Everything else that morning went smoothly and as planned; Harry found himself once more on the Hogwarts Express and unable to suppress an involuntary shudder.

The last time he had been on this train, he had been plucked straight off of it by a portkey given to him by one whom he had considered a friend. The prison which he had landed in no longer haunted his nightmares on a nightly basis, but it still crept up every now and then --- there was no unseeing the horrible sight he was made privy to.

Pansy was the last of Harry's group to enter the compartment, doing so just as the train began to glide out of Platform Nine and Three Quarters on the long trek to Hogwarts castle.

The sun shone brightly outside; a stark juxtaposition to the gloom of last year's first day of school. Harry watched it sparkle mesmerizingly off a lake as they began to enter less densely populated areas. He remembered from last year that they would soon spend a number of hours driving past large, open fields blanketed in vibrant fall colours that would only look all the more cheery when bathed in this beautiful sunlight. It was as if the summer was giving a final stand before quietly succumbing to the grasp of autumn and, eventually, winter.

"Any idea who this year's Defence professor is, Draco?"

Theodore's question drifted into Harry's ears, causing him to pull his head away from the window for the first time in a while. The conversation going on around him hadn't been overly stimulating and he found himself frequently spacing out. Probably because of the early hour at which he had been so unceremoniously awoken.

Draco cursed. "I knew I forgot to ask Father something." He looked at Harry. "I don't suppose *you* asked him?"

Harry had to resist the urge to raise an eyebrow. The emphasis the blond put on the word 'you' was odd. It was as if he spat it at Harry for reasons he couldn't entirely work out. Draco had actually been acting strangely ever since his birthday and particularly since their trip to the alleys. He had even sniped maliciously at Ron Weasley while Harry and Lucius had been getting their photos taken. Mr. Malfoy had fortunately led his son away before any real harm could come of the interaction, but Harry remembered hoping at the time that Draco might have blown off all of his steam while sniping at Weasley.

Clearly he hadn't and it had only grown worse since then. If they were alone, Harry might have called Draco out on it, but he didn't dare do so in public. These people had been Draco's friends before his, for one thing. Theodore had stuck with him during Harry and Draco's schism last year, but he wouldn't trust him to truly back Harry if conflict broke out.

"I didn't, no," he answered, trying to keep the coolness from his voice. Pansy's eyes narrowed a fraction but no one else reacted, so he supposed he must have at least been mildly successful.

Draco waved a hand. "There you go, then. I suppose we'll find out at the feast tonight. Let's just hope whoever the old man hired isn't completely useless."

"Or scum," muttered Theodore.

This thought brought Harry's mind back to the mudblood comment Tiberius Nott had made weeks ago at his manor and the inner conflict it had caused Harry. It had resulted in him doing a great deal of research into history.

One of the best things about the Malfoy family library was that it was not at all prone to being filled with censored material. The history books dotted around its ancient shelves were very much not the kind the ministry would approve of. According to Mr. Malfoy --- who had called the ministry-approved books 'censored trash' --- this was for the best.

Harry had learned a great deal from them. He had read about the witch burnings and the persecution witches and wizards faced while they'd lived in the open. Many of the worst accounts came from the Middle Ages, but they didn't stop there. The Statute of Secrecy had been signed the same year as the Salem Witch Trials had taken place, after all.

It had only reaffirmed everything he had known about muggles and made his hatred all the worse. Even more so after reading up on the Statute of Secrecy.

There was a large part of him that thought Grindelwald had a point, as much as that thought terrified him on a number of levels.

Why was it that the witches and wizards were the ones driven into hiding? They were born superior, born with powers the muggles could never hope to match. And they were just better. Harry had lived in both worlds and the magical one was just infinitely more interesting. It also didn't seem to suffer from many of the problems its muggle counterpart did. Sure, discrimination ran wild, but it didn't seem to lead to wars in the same way it did in the muggle world. There was of course Voldemort's war --- which was nowadays referred to as the Purity War --- but even that had encompassed only Magical Britain. Witches and wizards had never seen anything like either muggle world war --- even if Grindelwald had been a large part of the second. Though, to what extent his involvement stretched was a highly-debated topic.

Muggleborns themselves... that was more complicated.

Harry could sympathize with them, on one hand. None of what they were being judged so harshly for was their own fault.

Not to say that he didn't see the purebloods' point.

His readings about muggleborns in particular had been very complicated, but much of it dated back to the philosophy Salazar Slytherin seemed to have held. He was, after all, perhaps the most infamous blood supremacist of all time --- though Voldemort had been not-so-quietly giving him a worthy challenge in the past few decades.

Slytherin had lived in a time when tensions between muggles and wizards in Britain had been high. The books he had read about the man at Malfoy Manor spoke of him in a surprisingly favourable light. Mr. Malfoy had told him he'd had an interest in Slytherin from an early age and done his best to collect a large number of accurate, uncensored tomes about the man and his life.

Even in these, the details were blurry.

Most of them seemed to agree that Slytherin had feared a large-scale conflict between the muggles and the wizards. It wasn't that he'd had any doubt which side would win, but the two sides interacted so closely that a war would have been devastating on either side. Especially with magical education in its infancy. Most witches and wizards of that age were much less skilled than their modern day comparables since they had never truly been taught actual magic.

Slytherin saw the muggleborns as a link between the magical and muggle world. He was in favour of splitting the two worlds, even back then, and he viewed the feat as impossible; for so long as muggleborns were allowed entry into their world. He thought they would lead to the war he feared so greatly, hence his firm stance against their ability to attend Hogwarts.

That's what most of the books had said, anyway; though a few had cited that he had never wanted to even stop muggleborns attending Hogwarts.

This was about where any semblance of the books agreeing with each other ended.

Some painted him as a hero who sought the protection of the magical world. Others vilified him for going too far. Some said he had murdered, some said he had massacred, and some even spread a rumour about a fabled monster left at Hogwarts --- though Harry found this last tale to be more unlikely than all the rest.

He had also learned an interesting tidbit about Slytherin while reading these books which had made his heart stop and his blood run cold.

All of the books had made a massive fuss about Slytherin being able to speak to snakes. Harry had at first been confused by this. Once he had been made aware of the wizarding world, he had sort of just assumed everyone could do it. He had done it at the London zoo and even a few times in the gardens over the years, though he only even remembered some of those occasions after his most significant interaction of the serpentine variety.

Apparently, the ability was not at all one most magicals had. The books all claimed it was an ability of those who were descended from Salazar himself, one that was called Parseltongue. Harry hadn't thought the Potters shared any link to Slytherin. They weren't noted in any of the books he had found in the library discussing the history of the language. The last known speakers of the language had been the Gaunt family, who --- as far as Harry knew --- had no line of relation to his own family.

He had pondered whether or not he should ask Mr. Malfoy about the ability to speak to snakes, but he had decided against it. Many of these books painted it as something foul, certainly not something to be admired. Even the books that depicted Slytherin in a relatively favourable light didn't have great things to say about the ability. Its reputation had been tarnished over the years. With Slytherin's own reputation, that of his Hogwarts house, the Gaunt's well-publicized descent into deranged ruin, and the infamy of Voldemort, the language was nowadays viewed as an inherently dark ability.

Perhaps it was best if no one knew that Harry possessed it. Perhaps it was best if he just hid that ability away. It wasn't as though it could be of a great deal of use, could it?

He somehow doubted that hypothesis as his brain ran wild with potential usages. Much of the Slytherin common room was covered in serpentine decor. He knew much of the art of the wizarding world had the ability to become animated, so he wondered if the snakes in the common room or around the school would be prone to the same ability, too. He was sure there were other uses he was missing altogether, but that was the one which had filled his young, imaginative mind over the past couple of weeks.

"Personally," drawled Draco, "I don't much care who teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts so long as they know one end of a wand from another. I'm much more interested in everything else happening this year."

"Everything else?" Crabbe asked, leaning forward with curiosity. "What else is happening?"

Draco puffed out his chest. "*I'm* going to be playing seeker on the Slytherin Quidditch team."

Pansy squealed and began hastily congratulating him, but Theodore's eyes narrowed. "Confident, are we?"

Draco smirked. "It's not in doubt, Theodore. Father's bought brooms for the whole team. I've got mine already, of course." He glanced towards Harry with a strangely tight expression. "So does Harry. He'll be on the team too, naturally. Father's holding the rest of the brooms for now. The team will get them once Harry and I are officially selected."

Harry had been reluctant to go with that plan. Their final stop in Diagon Alley had been Quality Quidditch Supplies. The shopkeeper's jaw had nearly become detached from his face when Mr. Malfoy had purchased seven brand new Nimbus 2001s. He had said with no small amount of smugness that both Harry and Draco would get one and that the others would be used to ensure they made the Slytherin team.

Harry had felt torn about this. He wanted to play on the team and had planned on trying out for months. Cassius would have probably killed him if he didn't. He had been excited for the challenge though, to see just how good he really was next to his older, more experienced housemates.

It also just felt... wrong.

Harry could sympathize with all the rest of them because it hadn't been that long since he himself hadn't had any money of his own. The course of action made him feel unclean, but he eventually decided to go along with it. This was the cunning, Slytherin way, and it guaranteed results. Harry would just have to get over his moral compunctions.

Draco had seemed unhappy for a different reason. He had asked for a gift when his father had promised to buy Harry anything he wanted. Mr. Malfoy had acquiesced, which meant the boys were set to get one gift each. But when they had reached Quality Quidditch Supplies, the man had purchased Harry one of the brooms without a second thought. Harry wondered if that's what had made Draco start acting so strangely.

He had felt as though the boy was jealous for all these weeks but until now, he hadn't been able to work out exactly what he was jealous over. This was petty, but it did at least make some sense from Draco's perspective, even if it made Harry want to bang his head against a wall so hard that Dobby the house elf would have been proud.

Harry fingered the ornate ring he now wore. It had indeed turned out to be genuine and it had arrived at Malfoy Manor less than a week after their visit to Borgin and Burkes.

Draco seemed in a foul mood for the next couple of hours, right up until the trolley lady appeared in the doorway.

"Anything off the trolley, dears?"

They all scrambled to purchase sweets but when they were fully equipped, Draco didn't turn back towards their compartment.

He grinned maliciously after stuffing confections into his pockets. "What do you all say we find Weasley and have a bit of fun? He must feel like a bigshot now that his father got that stupid bill passed."

Harry had no interest in antagonizing Weasley. Every time he thought of the boy, he envisioned the broken figure being led away from Longbottom's grave. That image seemed to have permanently stained itself onto the inside of Harry's skull, but his friends were already moving to follow Draco.

Somebody touched his arm and Harry turned, meeting Pansy's brown eyes. "Are you okay, Harry?"

He shook himself. "I'm... yeah, just tired."

Pansy gave him a look. "You don't want to go bother Weasley, do you?"

Harry shrugged helplessly. "I just... don't really care. He's never done anything to me and I don't see the point."

"I don't much care either," she admitted. "It's probably going to put Draco in an even worse mood and I personally don\'t want to be around *that*. I was thinking about catching up with another friend of mine if you wanted to come too?"

Harry nodded gratefully. "Sure, who am I meeting? Or do I know them already?"

"Well, there will be more than just her in the compartment, but I'm mainly looking to catch up with Daphne. You know her, but I don't think the two of you talk much."

They didn't, but Harry did know who Pansy was talking about.

Daphne Greengrass --- Heiress of the Founding House of Greengrass --- was a tall, blonde girl with pale skin, angelic features, and icy blue eyes.

Harry's group of friends made up about half of the year, but Greengrass was also very popular and made up the other half. Harry hadn't had much to do with her, but he knew she was both incredibly intelligent and seemed to be quite charming. In the end-of-year rankings, Harry had topped the list in Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts, and Transfiguration. Greengrass had handily taken first in Astronomy, History of Magic, and Potions, leaving the deceased Neville Longbottom the top spot in Herbology. Greengrass had been second in Herbology and third in many other subjects, which had baffled Harry for some time. With the exception of Potions --- a class she seemed to be a legitimate prodigy in --- her practical work was nothing special. It wasn't bad and she was decent enough at Charms, but she wasn't one of the top few students in Slytherin, let alone the school.

After Harry's conversation with Flitwick in the library last December, he thought he understood. Perhaps her theoretical work was just so good that her average wand work didn't even hold her back all that much. If that was true, she probably scored higher than both Harry and Granger on the theory side of things. It was the only way he could rationalize her being so high in the rankings.

Greengrass was indeed not alone in her compartment, though she sat in the centre of one of the two booths. She was joined by who Harry recognized as Blaise Zabini, Millicent Bulstrode, Lily Moon, and Tracey Davis. Zabini was a tall, thin, athletic-looking boy with dark skin, intense dark brown eyes, and sharp features. Bulstrode was the largest student in their year not named Crabbe or Goyle. There were a few kids taller than her, but her bulk was truly impressive. Lillian Moon was a plain-looking girl with mousy brown hair and eyes of a similar colour, while Tracey was a pretty girl with very light brown hair and sea green eyes.

"What brings you two here?" asked Daphne once Harry and Pansy had taken their seats.

He sat right across from Greengrass. Her stare unnerved him. Those eyes seemed to penetrate him as if they were picking him apart and analyzing his inner workings.

"Draco being a twat," said Pansy.

Daphne rolled her eyes. "Ugh! What has the idiot gone and done this time?"

"Oh, nothing specific. He's just been a right gloomy prat the whole train ride. Harry and I took the chance to run when he was gonna go off after Weasley."

"I'll never understand what you see in him, Pansy. He's decent-looking and he has the family name, but that's about it. He doesn't seem to be overly interesting, and any conversation with him seems to have the words 'my father' crop up at least once."

Pansy hid a giggle behind her hand and even Harry's lips twitched. He really did like Draco, but Daphne wasn't terribly far off the mark.

"If I were him," said Tracey, "I'd talk about my father too. Maybe he thinks if he talks about him long enough, he might wake up one morning with daddy's hair."

This sent all the girls into peels of laughter and even Harry had to fight down his own amusement. It seemed wrong to openly laugh at someone mocking his best friend, but he had to admit, he liked Daphne and Tracey so far.

They all talked for a large part of the ride; except Zabini, who Harry couldn't remember saying as much as a word.

By the time he and Pansy left the compartment, night had arrived outside and they needed to change into their Hogwarts robes. As they made their way back towards their own compartment though, Harry's mind couldn't help but roam over all that had just happened.

Daphne Greengrass was pretty, popular, very charming, and naturally charismatic, but there was much more to her than that. He had an odd feeling that even her theoretical work at school didn't tell the whole story, as far as she was concerned.

***Some time later...***

Draco hadn't been at all pleased when Harry and Pansy had returned to the compartment. He had actually put up a bit of a fuss and it hadn't helped when Pansy had told him where they had been. Harry was more than happy to get off the train and was oddly grateful for the fact that a number of bodies separated him from Draco.

Last year, they had entered the castle after crossing the Black Lake in small, rickety boats; this year, they would be taking the carriages up to Hogwarts.

Harry shuddered at the sight of the skeletal horses pulling the carriages. They looked some sort of mythical creature dramatized in a muggle horror movie. He had been exceptionally confused by them last June.

*"They're called thestrals,"* Theodore had whispered to him quietly. Harry would never forget the look the boy gave him. It was more searching and evaluative than any stare Harry had ever seen. *"They can only be seen if you've watched someone die and were old enough to understand what happened."*

He wondered, even now, what on earth Theodore might have put together. Was it possible the boy had deduced that he had watched Neville die? Or perhaps he thought he'd seen the demise of their Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. It didn't really matter, he supposed, so long as he stayed quiet and didn't press Harry on the matter.

Harry's group of friends soon watched as Professor McGonagall led forth the new crop of first years. Harry recognized Ron Weasley's little sister from Flourish and Blotts. She was the second-to-last in the queue. The boy behind her looked oddly familiar to Harry as well, which was strange, because he was sure the two of them had never met.

The Sorting Hat sang a song which heralded a chorus of applause before it bowed to each of the tables and fell silent, prompting Professor McGonagall to begin calling the new first years forward.

Harry didn't pay much attention until a familiar name was called.

"Carrow, Flora!"

Carrow was a Sacred Twenty-Eight family and Harry remembered that two of the family's members were serving life sentences in Azkaban for their part in the Purity War.

"SLYTHERIN!"

That had been one of the faster sortings Harry could remember.

"Carrow, Hestia!"

Merlin, what was it with the magical world and twins? There were of course the infamous Weasley twins, the Patil twins from Harry's year, and now the Carrow twins? Given Hogwarts' relatively small population, it was strangely impressive --- especially considering Harry was sure he was missing a number of other pairs.

"SLYTHERIN!" the hat called just as quickly.

"Creevey, Colin!"

Harry felt a deep pang in his stomach as Colin Creevey scrambled unsteadily onto the stool. He reminded him painfully of Neville, even if he didn't have a family name like Longbottom behind him.

"GRYFFINDOR!"

The sorting continued, with only Benedict Cuffe, Natalie Farley, Alex Jugson, Martin Harper, Derrick Mulciber, and Rhea Rowle sorted into Slytherin.

"Weasley, Ginevra!"

Harry was sure Weasley would be an easy sorting, but the hat took longer with her than it had with any of the other new students this year. It did eventually proclaim her a Gryffindor and sent her off to the scarlet and gold table, but it hadn't been a swift affair.

"Yaxley, Cadmus!"

Bugger! That was why the boy had looked so familiar. His golden-blond hair, soft features, and sea-green eyes were terribly reminiscent of both his father's and older sister's. Harry had never even realized Cassie had a younger brother, but the likeness was obvious.

He was sorted into Slytherin almost as fast as the Carrows. By the time he had taken his seat with the other new Slytherins, Professor Dumbledore had taken to his feet, beaming at all of them as if nothing pleased him more than to see their faces whole and healthy.

"Welcome back!" he said. "Before I bore you with an old man's long-winded ramblings, I will allow you all to fill your long-desiring stomachs with some truly excellent food. Tuck in!"

Golden plates appeared in front of each student and heaping mounds of every kind of food imaginable were everywhere. The showcase didn't surprise Harry nearly as much as it had last year. Especially because now, he was pretty sure the house elves had just taken Dumbledore's cue.

He got about five minutes into his meal before he began to feel uncomfortable and wasn't sure why. It didn't take him long. Glancing around, he quickly realized that almost all of the first-year Slytherins were staring at him, though Cadmus Yaxley was doing so with a painful intensity.

He understood why they were curious, of course. The Boy-Who-Lived being sorted into Slytherin House had caused quite the uproar last year. It was of no surprise that their attention would be focused on him, but he wouldn't give the newbies the satisfaction of seeing him fidget. A year ago, he would have, but he was different now. He understood how Slytherin worked. It was all about power. He naturally had power over these students, being older and having more influential friends, but if he let them off put him so visibly on the first night, that balance would shift.

He met the stare of Cadmus Yaxley head-on, not so much as blinking until the younger boy looked away. He then gazed at all of the others in turn, raising a single eyebrow and asking a silent question.

They all went back to their food and he heaved an internal sigh. Merlin, Slytherin was exhausting sometimes.

Before he knew it, the dessert plates were clearing off --- much to the chagrin of both Crabbe and Goyle --- and Dumbledore had taken to his feet once more.

"Another year begins," he said happily, "but not before I make you all aware of a few start-of-term formalities.

"Mr. Filch has once again asked me to remind you all that magic is not to be performed in the corridors. He has insisted that infractions of this rule will be treated extra harshly this year." He smiled. "The same message goes for an impressive list of things pinned to the door of his office. You can view them all at any time for your collective reading pleasure."

Harry wasn't sure if he was imagining the amused twinkle in the old man's eyes, but he hoped he wasn't. It was so much more entertaining if it really was there.

"In case the bright new minds of today fail to ascertain as much from the name, first years should note that the Forbidden Forest is not to be entered under any circumstances.

"Quidditch trials will be held some time after the first week of classes. Please see your heads of house if you are a second year or above who is at all interested.

"And finally, the long-standing tradition of staffing additions continues. This year, I am especially excited for the occasion. It is my pleasure to welcome my very own brother, Aberforth, into the castle. He is most graciously taking up the position of Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor, and I cannot wait to hear all about his lessons. He is most unfortunately under the weather and will not arrive until tomorrow morning."

That... had not been expected.

The roar of noise that swept through the Great Hall was evidence of that. They'd had some fun throwing out wild theories during dinner, but with no new teacher present at the staff table, they hadn't had anything to go off of.

"It's even worse than I thought," huffed Draco. "He's bringing in his own brother to teach!" He sneered. "One Dumbledore was already doing enough damage to this place, two of them might ruin it."

Pansy was just giggling. "Aberforth Dumbledore," she managed to squeak out. "Isn't he the one who got caught for using illegal charms on goats?"

"Charming fellow, isn't he?" asked Daphne as she passed them on their way out of the hall. "I can't wait to learn all about magical creatures from an expert like him."

This proved too much for Pansy, who nearly fell over as she was laughing so hard at this point.

Harry wasn't laughing.

He was thinking that, yet again, it seemed like he was in for an interesting year at Hogwarts.

***The Great Hall***

***8:20 AM***

The morning after all the students arrived back at Hogwarts shared none of the vibrancy of the one before. The clouds were thick and grey, veiling the world in a dull sort of light. The gloomy weather threatened to sour the generally jovial atmosphere in the Great Hall that first morning back at Hogwarts, but none seemed to care. It appeared that the thrill of being back at such a magical place overrode the dreariness of the enchanted ceiling above.

Harry had been the first of his friends awake, though he hadn't actually gone to the library. He had taken a number of books from the Malfoy family library to Hogwarts and he had spent the morning pouring over them in the dormitory before the rest of his friends rose from their slumbers.

They had needed to wait especially for Pansy, who looked somewhat like a rigid corpse despite all the effort she had clearly put in to avoid that exact visage.

"Is that even healthy?" Harry asked, watching the copious amounts of coffee stream like a waterfall into Pansy's mug.

"I don't care," she mumbled. "I need it."

"What had you up so late?" Draco asked.

"Was watching first years."

Theodore smirked. "Speak up, Pansy, dear. We couldn't hear you."

She glared at him. "I was watching the new first years."

"Why?" asked Harry.

"Networking," she said tersely.

"Did you... uh, see anything interesting?"

"I did, actually. The prefects gave them a talking-to, like normal, but they actually gave them things."

"What sort of things?"

"That's the thing, I don't actually know. Each of the first years just got bags. I never actually got to see what was in them."

"Odd," said Theodore, "Yaxley and Warrington wouldn't have struck me as the type to hand out presents."

Cassandra and Cassius were the new fifth-year prefects. Harry found himself quite happy with the fact. That was now one-third of the Slytherin prefects who he could call friends. Hopefully, it would be enough to curb any potential antagonizers from the upper years.

Pansy just shrugged. "It could have been one of the older prefect's ideas. Either way, it doesn't matter; I just want to know what they got."

"A bit odd they would do it this year," said Harry. "We never got anything like that. Do any of you know if this has happened in the last few years?"

"Not sure," Pansy said with a gleam in her eyes, "but I plan on finding out."

Draco rolled his eyes. "Of course you do."

Timetables came in the minutes to follow when their Head of House, Professor Snape, made his way down the table and distributed the sheets of parchment. For second years, it was the exact same schedule they had used last year. From what Harry could tell, their timetable last year hadn't been a generic first-year schedule, but one specifically designed for those entering Hogwarts in the 1991-92 school year. It would be their timetable until the end of school; it would just become more complicated next year, when extra classes would enter the equation.

When Snape dropped Harry's timetable in front of him, he expected to be ignored altogether, but the Potions Master surprised him.

Their eyes met and Harry almost shivered. The man's glare was impressive; Harry had thought such venomous stares from Snape were reserved for the Gryffindors. It looked as though Harry had personally offended him. If he didn't know better, he might have thought he was seeing very real anger in the man's eyes. Their eye contact was broken soon after and Snape stormed off to distribute the new first-year timetables.

Harry watched him go with a pensive expression. He wasn't sure what he had done to Snape, but he wondered if this year he might actually grow to envy the way Snape had ignored him the entirety of the last.

***September 3, 1992***

***The Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom***

***10:40 AM***

The first day of classes had been uneventful. The most consequential of their lessons had been their double period with Professor McGonagall for Transfiguration, but the class had served as mostly a review of last year's material and a test of whether or not the students had actually done the summer reading.

Harry performed all the tasks with little effort and Theodore did quite well. Draco and Pansy were both less successful since Transfiguration had never been among their strengths. Crabbe and Goyle's performances were better left unspoken of.

Harry had actually practiced some Transfiguration over the summer. The limited amount he could, at least. He really just worked on his own method of visualization --- which had worked for him so well the previous year --- but largely, he had been reading up on the theory. Its theoretical component was the most difficult of all his classes, in Harry's opinion, so it was something he had been desperate to get ahead in. Over the holidays, he had learned that he actually enjoyed the subject more than he had realized and had actually gotten further ahead than he'd expected --- though he didn't plan to slow down. It was easily his second favourite class after Defence Against the Dark Arts and Harry wondered just how far ahead he might be able to get in both.

Speaking of Defence Against the Dark Arts, it was their second period class that next morning. The general mood among the Slytherins seemed to be one of trepidation. A number of them harboured inherent grudges against Dumbledore, so the news of his brother's hiring had not pleased a great many of them. Harry actually found himself cautiously optimistic. He knew that Aberforth would never hold a candle to his more talented brother, but he had a hard time believing that the brother of Albus Dumbledore would be incompetent.

Every member of the class was seated minutes before the bell had rung. Their professor had not yet arrived, so Harry let his eyes roam over their classroom. Last year, it had been bedecked in what would have been decor reflective of Professor Quirrell had his body not been leeched off of by Voldemort. Dark drapes had covered the windows and the room had been lit with only ominous, magical lighting. Incense had burned all around the room --- supposedly in an unsuccessful bid to cover the smell of garlic. If Harry had to guess now, he would assume the failure on that front was intentional, seeing as it had not been Quirrell at all.

This year, their new professor had chosen to be much less expressive.

The windows were once again veiled, though this time they were obscured not by dark drapes but by very worn-looking curtains. The walls themselves were completely bare, except for a large number of torches dotted sporadically throughout the room, casting shadows across many of the gathered faces.

Their desks were lined up in simple rows one behind the other. Harry made straight for the back of the room, as was customary for him, and none of his friends had any hesitation following. Draco and Theodore, in particular, were among those most concerned by the identity of their professor.

The bell rang out before their professor entered the room. Two minutes later, the class had begun to grow impatient. Draco seemed especially agitated as he scowled and threw the occasional glare towards the door.

About a minute and a half later, the blond turned to do so again, only for the classroom's lone entrance to fly open with a loud *BANG* and for Draco to very quickly force his face blank.

The man who stepped into the room wore grey robes that clearly looked as though they had seen better days. They were frayed around the edges and Harry thought the seams looked as though they might split at any moment. His long, grey hair was stringy and looked unkempt, as did his beard of the same colour. Harry thought his eyes might have been every bit as blue as his brother's, but it was hard to tell, for his glasses were coated in a thick layer of dust, grime, or... something.

It was an odd dichotomy, comparing Albus to Aberforth. Albus Dumbledore's pearly silver hair and beard only added to his usually lurid robes to form an image of a grand old man who was completely and totally in control at all times. Aberforth appeared much the opposite. His grey hair did not look grand, but weathered, and his robes gave the impression of a man who had been through many hard times. It was a startling juxtaposition, but it got Harry's attention almost at once.

"Welcome to Defence Against the Dark Arts and all the rest." The man's voice was gruff and a bit raspy. It gave the impression of heavy disuse. "I'm not going to spend time explaining what this class is about. If you've spent a year in the damn thing and haven't figured that much out yet, it's your own fault and not worth my time. I won't bother talking about myself, either. I don't want to, and I'm sure my dear brother has already said more than enough."

The class stared. They had never had a professor like this. All who had taught them so far had been very standard in their approach. Quirrell... or Voldemort --- Merlin, Harry hated that thought --- had been the least of them, but even he had spoken eloquently and with great care. Aberforth seemed to care neither for them nor what they thought of him. It was refreshing, in a strange sort of way --- if a bit off-putting.

"Last year, I've been told you covered the basics. You learned what separates a jinx from a hex, and a hex from a curse. You learned some basic spells to keep you safe in a tie-up and you practiced the necessities; dodging, aiming, so on, so forth. Am I correct?" The class nodded. Aberforth's expression looked oddly blank before he spoke again. "Good; turns out the stutterbox wasn't a complete waste of everyone's time."

A number of Harry's classmates whispered to each other and seemed confused by the way this man spoke of Quirrell.

Harry had never thought much on it, but his brain put the pieces together.

Quirrell had been a stuttering mess when they had crossed paths in the Leaky Cauldron, but he had been quite the opposite in class. It was obvious the stuttering had been an act. The way Professor Dumbledore specified that Quirrell wasn't a waste of everyone's time and called him a stutterbox made Harry think that the man had kept his act up around all who were not Slytherins. It was a risky move on the man's part, but it hadn't backfired. Then again, Voldemort had supposedly been a Slytherin long ago. He likely knew the house wasn't about to oust the best Defence Against the Dark Arts professor they'd had in years.

"This year," Aberforth continued, "we'll be building on that. You won't be learning a ton of new spells in this class; that's not until fourth year --- apparently. I think it's rubbish, but I don't write the syllabus, so take it up with the ministry. We'll be covering how your other subjects can tie into my class, and we'll be making sure you know how to react to situations. You can't all be high and mighty like my hero of a brother. Walking into a fight with your wand at the ready doesn't work for everyone. There are right and wrong ways to do it."

This actually sounded interesting to Harry, though he feared he might grow bored with it. Yaxley had him thinking through scenarios each week over the summer, so he was quite far ahead in this department already.

"But first," said the professor, "let's review a very important trick you all worked on last year, shall we?" His eyes scanned the room. "Malfoy!" he barked, making Draco flinch. "Up here, now."

Draco looked like he might protest until he looked up and spotted the expression on their professor's face. It was extremely stern-looking and certainly did not give off the impression that disobedience would be tolerated. There was also something else in the old man's eyes. Something Harry couldn't identify.

Draco hastened to stand and scrambled up to the front of the room. "Face me!" their professor demanded, and Draco did so. "Good, now --- Dolor!"

Draco yelped as the old man's Stinging Hex struck him square in the chest and a follow-up grazed his shoulder.

The class held their breath.

"What are you doing, you batty old man!?" Draco demanded.

"Teaching," was the only answer Aberforth gave before firing off another two Stinging Hexes. Draco dodged these and started glaring. "Well, would you look at that? He does remember how to dodge. Let's make things more interesting then, shall we?"

By more interesting, he meant firing spells at Draco much faster and, occasionally, without incanting. They were mercifully all Stinging Hexes, but he had Draco at it for quite some time. By the time he was done, the boy limped back to his seat and when the bell rang at the end of the class, the stream of expletives flowing from Draco's mouth was truly something to behold.

Harry, for his part, wasn't sure what to think. The man had been a decent instructor once he had finished making an example of Draco, but that had been... unexpected.

Really, the whole thing had been. Harry wasn't sure what exactly he had expected, but it most certainly had not been that.

***September 4, 1992***

***The Potions Classroom***

***9:10 AM***

Draco hadn't stopped complaining about their first lesson in Defence Against the Dark Arts for the rest of the day. Harry couldn't decide whether to laugh or be annoyed. He could understand why Draco was upset, but did he really have to remind them and anyone else who would listen about it every thirty seconds? Some of the older students had been much less impressed and had let Draco have it vocally --- which had only provoked him into an even greater temper.

His mood had not passed by the time the next morning came around and as the second-year Slytherins entered the Potions classroom, Harry wondered whether or not he even wanted to be paired with Draco right now.

Not that it mattered.

"I think not, Potter," drawled Snape when Harry made to sit down beside Draco. "You will be partnering with Crabbe for the foreseeable future. Maybe then you won't be able to rely on the ability of your partner. This way, you might actually gain something beyond a mere shred of adequacy in the subject."

Harry seethed as he moved his things beside Crabbe. He liked the larger boy, even when he was quiet. He wasn't the fastest broom of the bunch, but he was loyal and when he did actually speak, he occasionally had a bit of humour up his sleeve.

"Sorry," the boy muttered, looking down at the desk as though he had caused the whole ordeal. He obviously knew Harry wasn't pleased to be brewing with him; not with the sheer number of times he had somehow managed to melt cauldrons the year before.

"It's not your fault," Harry muttered, presently locked in a staring contest with Snape. The man seemed to watch for any outward reaction, but Harry gave him nothing despite the way the Gryffindors snickered on the other side of the room.

He had no idea what he had done to Snape in the first place to warrant being completely ignored while he showered anyone else in the house who so much as breathed with points for the most innocuous of things. That had been surprisingly disheartening at first, but Harry had grown accustomed to it over the course of his first year.

But this... this was an entirely different level of malice. He could deal with it, but it confused him. He understood why the Dursleys disliked him. They were muggles and feared him for his magic, feared him for so many oddities they could never hope to understand. It did not at all excuse their actions, nor did it make Harry any more inclined to forgive them, but at least he understood.

The way Snape had gone out of his way to antagonize Harry and make his life more difficult for no apparent reason... that didn't make sense.

Draco didn't look pleased either, but Snape was paying neither of them any mind now. He had spun on his heel and silenced the still-snickering Gryffindors with a glare.

"Weasley!" he snapped. "What is the name and appearance of the most powerful truth potion our world has ever seen?"

The boy flushed. "I don't know," he gritted out.

Harry had nearly jumped out of his seat.

Truth potion?

The wizarding world had *truth potions?*

He actually shuddered, drawing a concerned look from Crabbe that he waved off. First mind reading and now truth potions? What the hell had he gotten himself into?

Snape's lip curled. "Finnigan," he next called upon, "what is Polyjuice Potion and why is it illegal?"

Seamus Finnigan flushed deeply. "I dunno."

"Speak up, Finnigan, I can't hear you."

"I said I don't know, sir."

"I see." Hermione Granger looked fit to burst. She was looking at Snape with wide, puppy-dog eyes as if begging to be called upon. "Are you impatient, Granger?" asked Snape. "Are my questions perhaps so easy you are just bursting to earn your house so much as a point?"

The bushy-haired Gryffindor was frantically shaking her head, but Snape was having none of it. "Very well, Granger. What is the potion which gives off the most alluring smell to whoever falls under its power?"

Hermione deflated, clearly not knowing the answer.

Snape tutted. "Pathetic, all of you. The most powerful truth serum in the world is Veritaserum. It is a colourless, odourless liquid, which makes it ideal for subtle use. Polyjuice Potion is illegal because it allows one person to take on the exact appearance of another. I doubt even any of you are thickheaded enough to miss the potential implications of such a potion." He sneered at Hermione. "For your information, Granger, the potion I was referring to was Amortentia. It is the most powerful love potion in the world. Remember that; I fear you may need to make use of it in the future.

"Now," the man continued, ignoring the stricken look on Hermione Granger's face, "turn to page one hundred and ninety-seven in your textbooks and we will begin."

Harry immediately realized there had been some truth to what Snape had said. His potion-brewing abilities had clearly lagged very far behind his wandwork. He was competent on his own, he thought, but he wasn't quite good enough to prevent Crabbe from melting his cauldron. Not that many people would have been. Well, Greengrass would have --- she submitted her and Davis's potion about twenty minutes before the next person was done --- but she was an exception. An incredibly irritating one right now, at that.

Harry and Crabbe had been doing well until the latter had added double the fluxweed they had needed...

Snape did not take points from them, but his sneer said a thousand words.

Harry was more than a bit bitter by the time he and his friends left the class. Pansy was rattling on about how unfair Snape had been to Harry, which was both considerate and insensitive all at once, since Crabbe was standing awkwardly off to her side. Her platitudes meant nothing to Harry, so Theodore tried a slightly less conventional method.

"Cheer up, Harry. It's a Friday, remember?" He looked blankly back at him, as if asking what was his point. Theodore grinned. "Spell practice! I've learned some things over the summer. Maybe a mock duel or two could be interesting, while we're at it."

***September 6, 1992***

***The Entrance Hall***

***4:13 PM***

Theodore had regretted his words that night. The gap in skill between the two of them had been very obvious by the end of last year, but it had grown by leaps and bounds over the summer and now more accurately resembled a vast and gaping chasm. Theodore might have learned some new spells, but Harry had learned many more thanks to the books in the Malfoy family library and the one Diana had given him for his birthday. He had probably just spent more time reading than Theodore and he had always been able to master spells much faster than anyone else he knew.

There was also the fact he had spent the second half of his summer being tutored by Corban Yaxley. Not only did he come from a long line of duellists, but he had spent a number of years on the professional circuit after graduating from Hogwarts. From what Harry had ascertained, it was a Yaxley family tradition. His skill had grown by untold margins too large to measure during those lessons, and beating Theodore now seemed almost boring.

The first day of the weekend had come and Harry had actually spent much of it reading. A great deal of it had been spent away from his friends in the library. He wasn't sure what was going on with Draco, but he had known he'd needed a break from it. When he wasn't in the library, he had been sitting with his friends near the fire --- even then the book on curses from Diana had been in his hands.

That had been yesterday.

It was now the next afternoon and Harry trudged back up towards the castle side by side with Cassius. He knew he ought to feel like he had just received the Order of Merlin after his incredible first performance on a Quidditch pitch, but he couldn't.

Not with the way Draco had stormed off in a raging temper, ignoring his calls as he went.

***Earlier that day...***

Sunday morning dawned bright, and sunlight blessed them with its presence for the first time since their journey to Hogwarts. It was not a warm, glowing sun, but a deceptive one full of mischief; for it only lured those out into its light and exposed them to surprisingly frigid air. It was a clear indication that the warm weather would not last forever, and to Harry, it seemed like a reminder that winter was eventually on its way.

What made the brisk temperatures and bitter winds all the worse was that Slytherin was holding their Quidditch tryouts that day. Draco complained loudly about this as he and Harry made their way out across the sloping lawns and down towards the surprisingly empty Quidditch stadium. Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team captain, had promised no spectators would be allowed in the stadium. It would give away the fact they were sporting Nimbus 2001s, and that was an advantage Flint wasn't high on losing.

"It's still ridiculous," Draco said for the hundredth time. "We're already on the team; Father made sure of that. Just give me seeker, you chaser, and be done with it."

It turned out Marcus Flint had other ideas.

"What do you mean we have to tryout?" Draco hissed at the older boy in a fury. "My Father---"

"Said he would give us all the brooms if you and Potter got on the team. Yes, Malfoy, I know; now shut the fuck up and listen!" Draco shut his mouth with the look of someone who had just swallowed an especially sour lemon. "Both you and Potter are on the team. I don't know if you can fly nearly as well as you think you can, but Warrington vouches for Potter, and I trust his judgement. Even if neither of you could outfly a sack of shit, I want those brooms too badly."

"Then---"

"I said shut it, Malfoy. Your Father never said I couldn't put you through the wringer --- don't tempt me." Again, Draco fell quiet. "Another thing he never said was that you had to be seeker, or chaser, or whatever."

Flint grinned in a malicious sort of way. "Neither of you can play beater --- scrawny as a wand, the both of you --- and Bletchley's too good a keeper to lose. Montague's a decent chaser, but he can get stuffed if it means we get those brooms." His eyes gleamed. "But we do have a position open for seeker. I hate to break it to you, Malfoy, but it's the most important position in Quidditch. I'm gonna make damn sure I pick the right person for that job and if half of what Warrington says about Potter is right, I'm not sure you're it.

"Now," he snapped, "up in the air, the both of you!"

***Back in the present...***

"I just don't get it," said Harry, kicking at a stray stone right before they crossed the threshold and re-entered the castle proper. "What did I do to him? What have I ever done to him?"

Harry and Draco had both competed against one another in a number of seeker drills, and the outcome hadn't been terribly close.

It became obvious quite quickly to those who didn't know Draco that he had indeed not exaggerated his abilities on a broom. He actually would have made quite a good seeker on most teams, but it was just as obvious from the beginning that he was not going to be filling the position for Slytherin.

Harry had a natural grace that Draco couldn't match and he was also just much more daring --- a surprisingly valuable trait for a seeker. Draco had performed well and by no means had he embarrassed himself, but he had never really stood a chance.

When the decision had been made, Draco had stormed away and nothing Harry could say had snapped him out of the mood.

"You beat him," Cassius answered simply. "Sometimes, that's all it takes."

"It isn't just that, though," Harry insisted. "He's been weird like this for a while. Ever since my birthday."

Cassius's brow furrowed. "What happened on your birthday?" Harry shrugged helplessly, unsure as to where any of this had come from. "Look, Harry, don't worry about it, all right? It'll be fine. Malfoy just needs to swallow his pride, grow a pair, and get over it. Once he does that, all should be fine."

Harry hoped Cassius was right, but a sinking part of him doubted the truth of his words.

They made idle small talk all the way down the stone steps leading into the dungeons, passed the serpentine decor of a corridor Harry had always thought existed simply to misdirect the other houses, and into the Slytherin common room itself.

"Cassius, Harry, come here."

It took Harry a moment to register the voice, but he had heard it enough to remember.

"Afternoon, Cassie," said Cassius, slumping down on the couch between her and Diana.

The female prefect gestured for Harry to take a seat on her other side, and it was he who she turned to first. "How did Quidditch pan out?"

They talked for quite some time, but eventually Cassie had to leave for her rounds as a prefect. As she stood, Harry felt something brush up against him. He wouldn't realize until later that she had smoothly slipped a note of parchment into the pocket of his robes.

***September 10, 1992***

***Severus Snape's Office***

***8:00 PM***

Much to Harry's relief, Cassius had actually been right in his assessment of Draco. The two of them began interacting again as normal the Tuesday after their scrum on the Quidditch pitch. Draco never apologized, nor did he mention the two days of forced separation. He seemed to treat the whole thing like it had never happened and Harry was more than willing to do the same in return. Pansy's eyes cut between them for most of the day as if she were expecting something to happen again.

Cassie's note had come with the promise of duelling lessons, as her father had told Harry would be the case, but there was no schedule set. She requested he write her with a few times that would work and then she would get back to him with the final time.

That had been the last significant event --- barring his make-up with Draco --- that had happened until tonight.

The entire Quidditch team had received missives that morning at breakfast requesting their presence in Snape's office that evening. After the way the man had treated him in Potions, Harry could not say he was at all looking forward to the event, but he trudged along with Draco nevertheless.

It was the first time Harry had been in the office belonging to his Head of House and he personally could have done without the experience.

Snape's office was dark and looked to Harry more like a cave housing some sort of horror-film monster than a place where his Head of House might mark essays. The room was dimly lit and had a sinister feel. The walls were cloaked so deeply in shadows that Harry wondered whether or not they were enchanted. Shelves bore vials of all sorts of repulsive things: animal intestines, bits of terrifying, magical plants, and even what appeared to Harry like a human brain, just to name a few. Around these shelves floated different vials containing actual potions. Their varying colours were the brightest light in the room.

Snape gave all members of the team not named Harry Potter or Draco Malfoy their Nimbus 2001s, urged them to write letters of gratitude to Mr. Malfoy, and gave them what was perhaps meant to be an encouraging speech about the glory of Slytherin house and the lofty standards that must be upheld. It came off more threatening than inspiring, in Harry's opinion, but time would only tell whether or not it would work.

"Potter!" called Snape as they all made their way towards the room's exit. "Stay behind!"

Draco shot a questioning look over his shoulder, but Harry shook his head. He had no idea what Snape wanted, nor how long it would take. Plus, Draco had not been pleased the last time Snape had interfered with Harry, since he had, in a sense, gotten caught in the crossfire. Given how fragile their friendship still felt, Harry thought that outright avoidance of a potential repeat was probably the best course of action he could take.

"You wanted to speak with me, sir?" Harry asked once the rest of the team had filed out of the room.

Snape scowled. "Do not overinflate your own importance, Potter. The rest of the staff may fawn over you because of a fluke many years ago, but I do not and will never hold you in such a lofty regard." The man reached a hand into the pocket of his robes and withdrew a sealed scroll of parchment. "A message from the Headmaster," said Snape. "Now, be gone, since I most certainly do not wish to speak with you."

Harry left the room with a great sigh. Snape's behaviour was going to be quite vexing if it continued, but he pushed it from his mind, far more interested in the parchment he had been given.

*Dear Harry,*

*I thought it only right I allow you to settle in before disturbing your already full schedule. Especially now, with a Quidditch position I offer the sincerest of congratulations for.*

*If you are still eager, we will begin our planned lessons next Friday, on the 18th of September, at 8:00 in the evening.*

*If this time is for some reason inconvenient to you, please write back at once.*

*Yours truly,*

*Albus Dumbledore*

*P.S. I adore sherbet lemons.*

Harry grinned ear to ear, thankful no one was in the corridor to see him now. He had no idea what the last bit meant, but he was beyond excited. Finally, he would get to learn Occlumency, and from Albus Dumbledore, of all people.

***September 13, 1992***

***The Quidditch Pitch***

***7:12 AM***

Sunday morning blossomed much like the one before, with streaming bright sunlight and vivid blue skies. The difference was that the air was more favourable. Instead of its frigid bite from the previous week, the seven robed figures making their way down towards the Quidditch pitch felt only its warm and gentle caress. A soft breeze blew across the land and the smallest of the procession thought the pleasant gusts of wind may have felt like slender fingers running through his dark, messy hair. Not that he had experience with such sensations, but it was a nice thought.

"The hell?" asked Derrick --- one of the beaters --- gesturing in front of them.

Up ahead, the Quidditch stadium loomed with the sun only just poking out over the highest of its seats. It was as pristine as ever, but it was not the stadium itself that had drawn the beater's attention.

Far above the highest rows of benches, figures flew through the sky like scarlet-clad comets. Except for one of them, perched high atop his broom and standing guard over a towering set of hoops, the group resembled crimson blurs as they rocketed around the pitch. Their laughter carried in the early morning breeze. In the absence of any other noise, it reached the ears of the seven figures adorned in green and silver robes; each of them carrying their own broomsticks, set on occupying the same pitch that was now in use.

Marcus Flint cursed. "I'll kill the lot of them; Snape booked us the pitch special! When I get my hands on Wood, Gryffindor might be without a keeper!"

Given the sheer size and impressive musculature of Flint, Harry thought there really was an outside chance that might be the case if he truly did snap.

Soon enough, they all poured onto the pitch, drawing mutters from members of all four houses who were gathered in the stands. It looked like some sort of staged invasion to many of the onlookers. The Gryffindor team must have thought something similar, for a number of bodies hurtled towards the ground almost at once."

"Flint!" Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. "This is our practice time! You can clear off now!"

Flint's eyes sparkled with malice in the early morning sunlight. "Plenty of room for all of us, Wood."

The three Gryffindor chasers and the youngest Weasley had landed now, joining their captain and beaters. Johnson, Spinnet, and Bell looked oddly out of place in front of the Slytherin team, all of whom but Harry and Draco were towering males in at least their fourth year.

The Slytherins all stood shoulder to shoulder in front of Harry and Draco, completely casting the two second years in their shadow. Harry actually smirked. Shock factor was a wonderful advantage if it was used correctly.

"But I booked the field!" shouted Wood, positively spitting with rage. "I booked it!"

Ah," said Flint, "but I've got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape." Flint produced a scroll of parchment from his robes with a flourish and cleared his throat theatrically, like a muggle director calling for quiet on the set. "*'I, Professor S. Snape,* *give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their two newest members.*'"

"You've got new members?" Wood asked sharply, clearly distracted. "Where?"

Draco winked at Harry, plastered a broad smirk upon his face, and stepped out from behind the five large figures. His pale skin seemed to glow in the sunlight which sparkled off his platinum-blond hair --- not unlike it did the dew on still-wet grass --- seeming to make it shine unnaturally. The image was really quite ethereal in its aesthetic and Harry had to admit that Draco had a gift for dramatic flair.

"Aren't you Lucius Malfoy's son?" asked one of the Weasley twins, looking at Malfoy with dislike and completely ruining the holier-than-thou image Draco had managed to naturally conjure.

"Funny you should mention Draco's father," said Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. "Let me show you the generous gift he's made to the Slytherin team."

As one, the Slytherins --- minus Harry, who was still obscured by the others --- raised their left arms, all of which held pristine Nimbus 2001s. If the sunlight had sparkled off of Draco's hair, it positively danced across the golden label of the brooms, and the ostentatious lettering seemed to dance in dazzling ways.

"Very latest model. Only came out last month," said Flint carelessly, flicking an imaginary speck of dust from the end of his own. "I believe it outstrips the old 2000 series by a considerable amount. As for the old Cleansweeps," he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives, "sweeps the board with them."

None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment. Ron Weasley was opening his mouth and then closing it repeatedly, looking like a fish out of water as he stared in transfixed horror at Draco Malfoy, who was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits.

"What's the matter?" asked Cassius, feigning concern. "No reaction? Are our brooms not impressive enough for you?" He sighed. "Oh well, maybe our *other* new teammate will do the trick."

Recognizing his cue, Harry took his own turn to step out into the light, maintaining a blank expression as he stared at each of the Gryffindors in turn. His appearance actually drew gasps from the three chasers and Ron Weasley looked as though he might faint.

"Oh, come now," Cassius said. "You don't like your golden boy anymore now that he's wearing green and silver? Such chivalrous loyalty, that."

"Oh, look," pointed out Miles Bletchley, "there seems to be a field invasion."

Slytherins and Gryffindors alike were flooding the pitch now. Granger rushed to Weasley's side and frantically asked what was going on, while Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Theodore joined the Slytherins' ranks, having been made aware of the early morning practice by both Harry and Draco.

Weasley had obviously said something about the brooms because Granger's eyes had practically bulged out of her head.

"Just noticing now, Weasley?" Draco asked in a bored, detached-sounding voice, holding his broom up to the light before shrugging. "Don't feel too jealous. I'm sure the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid for them."

The Slytherins howled with laughter. Harry feigned a smile; laughing at the financial misfortunes of others hit a bit too deeply after ten years of being little more than a prisoner.

Granger bristled and stepped forward. "At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent."

The smug look on Draco's face flickered. "No one asked your opinion, you filthy little mudblood!"

Harry knew all hell was going to break loose a second before it happened.

A number of Gryffindors fired spells at Draco all at once. Flint tackled Draco to the ground, which was fortunate because Ron Weasley's spell sailed right through the space the blond had occupied not seconds earlier...

And smacked straight into the face of Pansy Parkinson.

Everyone seemed to freeze as the girl's mouth opened wide and let out a horrible scream before slugs began pouring from her mouth by the dozen. People screamed, one or two vomited, but Harry just saw red. He forgot all about the reason the fight had been started, forgot about how he held no dislike for Ron Weasley, and even that Pansy hadn't been his desired target.

Harry's wand came up, seemingly of its own volition.

"Diffindo!"

The Cutting Curse was not yet one they had learned. Judging by what Harry had heard about the Defence Against the Dark Arts curriculum, it would probably be covered in fourth year. He had read about it --- in the book of curses Diana had sent him for his birthday --- though this was the first time he was trying it.

Weasley let out a cry of pain as a spray of crimson flowed from the wound now etched upon his skin. Harry's aim had been true and the spell had severed his lip, leaving part of it hanging and causing blood to stream from it like a grotesque waterfall.

Wands were drawn everywhere and Harry threw himself to the side as jets of light shot towards him from all angles. The Slytherins were retaliating now and it was complete and total bedlam. Some people fell to spellfire, others tripped over housemates as they tried to flee, and some spells just collided in mid-air, ricocheting and reflecting off of one another at terrifyingly unpredictable angles.

"AERIA IMPULSUM!"

There was an unnaturally loud *WOOSH* from somewhere behind them as something flew above their heads.

Then...

*BANG!*

It was like a thunderbolt had tumbled from the heavens, bringing with it a blinding flash of silver lightning that left everyone on the Quidditch pitch blinking stars from their vision.

Or perhaps that was the wall of concussive force that had slammed into the pitch, sending every last battling student sprawling, many of their wands tumbling from their grasps.

Groans could be heard as many students pushed themselves up onto all fours. Harry was among them. He had no idea what to expect but yet again, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor surprised him.

"All of you, off the pitch, now!" shouted Aberforth Dumbledore, glaring at all of them. "No arguments!" he bellowed when some students made to protest. "I don't give a goat's bollocks who started it; I'm finishing it. I'll investigate and hand out punishments later. For now, get the hell off this pitch before I cast something else!"

That got everyone moving. Nobody wanted to know how the man would follow that up.

"Did you see that?" Harry heard some students muttering.

"What the fuck was that spell?" an upper-year asked with bated breath.

Harry did not care.

Coherent thought had returned to him and suddenly, he remembered exactly how Pansy had gotten in the position she had and exactly who had started everything.

"What the hell were you thinking!" Harry stormed at Draco as soon as they entered the changing room.

All of the other team members paused and looked curiously upon the two flushing second years.

"What was *I* doing?" Draco asked. "You just stood there and let Weasley curse me!"

"How was I supposed to know you were going to goad the Gryffindors like a complete idiot?"

"What did you just call me?"

"Exactly what you were. We were probably outnumbered two to one; why the hell would you start a fight?" Draco was blushing deeply, but he didn't seem to have a worthy answer. "Exactly! There's no reason. Yeah, let's just use one of the most hated words in the magical world in front of a bunch of Gryffindors. Not like their house is known for chivalry or anything. I'm sure they'll take it just great---"

"Shut up!" hissed Draco, instinctually drawing his wand. Harry flicked his own wrist and summoned his from its holster. It slammed into his palm with a satisfying smack, but he did not raise it. He didn't want this fight; he wanted only to vent and to be ready, just in case.

"I'm sick of this crap, Harry! You're always right, aren't you? It never matters what I do, or how I act? It's always all about perfect Harry Potter. Nothing I do is ever good enough so long as you're around, because clearly, you can do no wrong."

"What the hell are you talking---"

"Oh, can it! Both of us know *exactly* what I'm talking about. Even my father doesn't give a hippogriff's dung about me so long as you're around." He sneered viciously. "I'm done with it, Potter. I tried to help you, but I'm done. If it weren't for me, you'd be a mudblood nobody without any friends and with half their house against him." Harry flushed with fury as his wand hand began to shake. "What? You haven't realized the only reason the upper years are leaving you alone is because you're best friends with me? Well, too late; I'm done. Have fun with all that."

Draco had spun on his heel in an excellent impression of an angry Snape and stormed from the room, leaving a shellshocked Harry Potter and a thoroughly befuddled Quidditch team in his wake.

**Author's Endnote:**

**I'm sure everyone saw that conflict coming; it was really just a matter of time. I won't reveal what's happening with Draco, but this is not going to turn into a Draco bashing fic. He has a very set arc in this story and this is a major part of it. Please have patience and don't immediately judge his actions too harshly. Both he and Harry are twelve and I have a feeling people are going to forget that. They actually --- for the most part --- act their age in this story. That is going to change pretty quickly as the fic progresses, but it hasn't changed yet.**

**Oh, also... the fallout from that scene will continue next chapter.**

**Author's Note:**

**I would like to issue a trigger warning for this first scene. It is darker than anything I have written so far and shows graphic depictions of restraint, violence, and gore. It also directly involves a child. I took no pleasure whatsoever in writing it, but it is an integral part of one of the story's most significant characters.**

**This is probably the only trigger warning I will ever issue because if you haven't realized what you're in for with this fic, you will after this, but I thought I would do it this once.**

**Chapter 8: The Erosion of Innocence**

***February 17, 1889***

***Königssee, Germany***

***12:00 PM***

A small boy stood among a group of many others, most much older and taller than he. Through a gap in the taller figures, he could make out the spectacle they were all gathered here to see, though his young mind struggled to grasp exactly what his sharp, bluish-silver eyes were watching.

It did not help that it was bitterly cold.

The last thing the boy wanted was to be here of all places, bundled uselessly against the ceaseless wind that seemed to try and penetrate his very skin. Least of all when he hadn't even an inkling why he was here.

The group of onlookers stood near St. Bartholomew's church, which rested atop one of many snow-capped mountains overlooking Lake Königssee.

The mountains rose high and stretched far, encircling the lake in their centre in what might have looked like an effort to prevent the water's escape. They formed a sort of protective ring around the body of water that had frozen over not long ago. A thin sheet of ice coated its surface, though one could still see the vividly blue water churning beneath.

It was a fair day and the sun beamed down upon them, bathing them in its light; a morbidly ironic fact on such an occasion. It gleamed off the snow atop each mountain, making the many peaks look like distorted blurs high above one of the region's most beautiful bodies of water. The rays of light reflected off the mountain and were redirected down onto the icy surface of the lake. The light danced across its surface as if it were but a sheet of glass, gleaming and sparkling like a bright star in a not-yet pitch-black sky.

The church stood atop one of the highest mountains, which allowed the wind to bite, free and unimpeded, at everyone present. It ripped at their nerves and tore at their skin, blowing the light dusting of snow from the night previous around like some pale sand in a windy desert.

Even the young boy realized that this was a particularly beautiful morning, though he had a great deal of trouble appreciating its majesty as he was too curiously entranced by the scene before him.

The onlookers formed a tight semi-circle around the front of the church. To any observing from afar, it might look as though they were trying to trap something or someone within their midst; and to be fair to such an onlooker, that was not at all far from the truth.

The tranquil scene was soon punctuated by a child's high, terrified screams. Two tall men wearing long furs half-dragged, half-carried her towards the church. She was being completely restrained and neither of the men spared her so much as a glance as she screamed out for her mutter and her vater.

The small boy saw the girl's eyes pleading with two figures who must have been her parents. They had her bright blonde hair and deep blue eyes, and their features were not at all dissimilar. What unnerved him was how detached they seemed from the proceedings. It was as if their daughter's cries meant nothing to them; like they were nothing more than the harsh whistling of the wind --- which was not nearly loud enough to drown out the child's terrified wails.

Neither of them came to her aid.

The girl's next scream was cut painfully short as it cut off in a gasp. The boy watched as the two men slammed her hard against the wall of the church. She slumped to the ground, all of the air knocked out of her lungs; light bits of snow clinging to her long dress as her chest convulsed up and down while she struggled to breathe. Hot tears streamed down her face, leaving lasting impressions before they fell onto the snow and created little bits of mist as the two substances met and their opposing temperatures clashed.

The sounds of her cries had not yet returned by the time the two men each fished something from their pockets. One of them grabbed the girl around the waist and hoisted her small, frail body into the air. She flailed, kicked, and even tried to bite the man, but it was to no avail. She was slammed hard against the wall once more. This time, the man continued holding her aloft as his partner bound her wrists. The other man let her feet graze the ground before they too were bound to the stone wall of the church.

Only now, with the girl held in a vertical, crucifix position could the youngest of the crowd examine her properly.

She would have been pretty had her face not been marred by the horrible tracks of her many tears. Her bright blonde hair fell to her shoulder blades. Her eyes were the most shocking shade of blue this boy had ever seen. He remembered the water in the lake far below, before it had succumbed to the forces of winter and frozen over, her eyes were as blue as that water in the peak of summer --- or perhaps even as blue as the perfectly clear sky that stretched out far above them. She was thin and even in her bindings, she managed to shake badly. The watching boy did not know why, but he had the strangest impression her shudders had little to do with the biting cold that was making him shake.

The crowd was rustling now. Every movement of their feet was audible as it displaced the snow. Soon, their collective muttering had drowned out even the girl's terrified screaming.

The boy felt someone grab his hand and he looked up to see his mutter. She had his own hair --- not even half a shade brighter than the bound girl's angelic blonde locks --- though his mutter's eyes were brown instead of his blue. She was normally bubbling with energy, but today the boy could not help but notice how she seemed to lack any of her normal exuberance. It boggled his young mind, but he could only assume it had something to do with why they were here. He wondered if that particular oddity had something to do with the girl.

*"Come,"* his mutter said in soft German, looking at him properly for the first time since their arrival.

Her face showed no signs of a smile as she gently pulled him in the same direction that the crowd was now moving. They had left the little girl and walked to their left, where a peculiar something sat waiting for them.

He had been here many times. His mutter was an avid churchgoer and he had been going with her for nearly as long as he could recall. He hated church; he found it dreadfully boring. He was a very intelligent child --- everyone, even him, knew that --- and he understood things he had no right to understand at his age, despite only being close to six. Understanding what was said did not make it any less dull, and he could not for the life of him comprehend why everyone loved a man they had never seen before.

In all of his trips to the church nestled high in the mountains, he had never seen the massive stack of stones that the crowd was now converging upon. The rocks ranged in size from pebbles to small boulders and the stack was nearly as tall as his mutter and several times as wide.

People began collecting these stones and making their way back into formation, regrouping into the tight circle they had stood in not a moment earlier. He and his mutter were among the last to collect their own stones. She forced a small pebble into his unoccupied hand with a distracted air about her. A part of him looked about for his vater, but he knew the man wasn't here. He did not know why, but his mutter had seemed upset when telling him that her husband didn't want to come. He had wondered whether or not that had been what the two of them were shouting about just a few days ago while they thought he had been asleep.

Their formation re-established quickly, but the atmosphere was different now. Before, it had been tense, but now, it was something more savage. Anticipation seemed to vibrate through the crowd. The young boy found it oddly reminiscent of when the children at school got excited about playing a new and interesting game.

The level of noise was different, too. There was no more mumbling. People spoke much louder. Their voices rose and rose, coalescing into a chorus of vicious jeers that echoed against the many mountains sprawled out around them. The boy could understand little of what was said. There were too many voices and so many words he had never before heard.

As the chants grew still louder, the boy's heartbeat seemed to quicken. He frowned deeply. He wasn't sure what this meant. He knew it sometimes happened after he had run for great periods of time and was starting to get tired. But he did not feel tired, just... nervous. Nervous in a way he could not explain; how could he possibly be nervous when he had no idea what was going on?

The crowd had begun chanting as one now, their savage roars tearing across the land like feral battle cries; the loud echoes only adding to the effect as the opposite mountain peaks seemed to scream their words back at them, as if daring them to do better. Now that the chorus was but one word, the boy could make out exactly what it was. It was a word he had heard once or twice before. He had read it in books he should not have been reading at his age, but his experience with the word was limited and he could not, for the life of him, understand why they would all be chanting such a thing on such a lovely day.

*"TOD! TOD! TOD!"*

Their voices grew louder and louder as the girl began to scream again. It was different this time. Not only more urgent, but it was of a higher pitch; the boy could see her eyes darting around this way and that as though she were a desperately cornered animal.

She must have understood their cries, too, and the boy wondered whether or not she might have actually realized what they meant for her. She did look to be a year or two older than him, so it was possible such a thing was true.

All thoughts on the meaning of things like chants vanished from the young boy's mind as the stones began to fly.

He did not see who threw first, but someone must have drawn back their arm and let their weapon fly.

The first stone hit the girl in the chest. The sickening crack of her bones breaking was drowned out by the bloodthirsty jeering of the crowd. The floodgates had been opened and stone after stone flew towards the girl. It was like the very Earth had deemed her foul and revolted against her very existence.

Her screams had been interrupted when the first stone had found its mark, being replaced by a gratuitous blend of a groan and a choked cry of unadulterated agony. Moans, grunts, and retching coughs could barely be heard over the excitement of the crowd for the brief time before they ceased altogether.

He wasn't sure exactly what had happened, though he suspected nothing good for the girl. It was now impossible for him to see as the tight formation had been broken. Bodies were strewn here and there as people ruthlessly tried to push to the front of the queue, all seemingly eager to throw their own stones for reasons the boy did not at all understand.

He was more confused than ever before. Why had they been throwing stones at a little girl? Especially one who seemed so completely and utterly afraid? It made no sense to him. It was not something people did to one another and he knew it was terribly wrong, but he just didn't understand why it was happening in the first place.

The crowd slowly thinned as he and his mutter drew closer and closer to the front of the queue. When they at last reached it, his mutter briefly released her tight grip on his hand and threw her stone.

He thought it somehow right to throw his own, but the sight before his eyes froze him in place more effectively than any wind could ever have done.

The girl was no longer bound to the wall. The boy would later wonder if the stones that had pummeled her had also struck her shackles and set her free.

Her body lay face up in the snow and it was a horrific sight. He could hardly process what he was seeing. Her body did not look like a body should look, nor did her head resemble anything he had ever seen on a human being.

If she had been thin before, now she was practically flat. It was as though someone had let the air out of her body; the distance between her chest and her back seemed non-existent. She appeared as one-dimensional as a bit of parchment, but that was far from the most grotesque thing he saw. Nor were her arms and legs, which were bent and splayed at twisted angles the boy hadn't known existed. Not even the jagged, oddly flat-looking bits of bone sticking out from said limbs, her chest, and her shoulders were the worst things he saw. They had punctured her skin at odd angles and resembled the world's most gruesome pincushion... if the pins had pierced the fabric from the inside.

The worst part of the girl was doubtlessly the *thing* that used to be her head.

Where it had at one time been an enclosed shape, it was now barely held together. The top was gone entirely, taking her luscious hair with it. Even the white bone inside had been horribly broken, exposing an odd, mushy thing he had never seen before. It looked as though it had at one time been something vaguely solid, but it was now a puddle of strange, chunky liquid which smelled vaguely like the fresh meat from the butchers. He saw one of the bits of her head that had used to be attached. One of the stones must have gone right through it and forced it to cave in, for it floated slowly in the fluids it had once protected.

The soup-like substance was slowly pouring out of her skull, like slow-going water from an especially stubborn well. It seemed not to exist once it left her head, however, for another substance monopolized the space around her, drowning all competition in its gory depths.

Thin, red liquid streamed from all imaginable places on the girl's body. It poured from her skull, from the places her bones had pierced her skin, and many other places the boy could not will himself to look at. The substance he knew to be called blood flowed like a crimson river, staining the pearly white snow a red as vivid as summer wine spilled upon a fine, linen cloth.

The pebble in his hands fell from numb, nerveless fingers. The sensation had nothing to do with the frigid cold, but everything to do with the sight before him. For no less than thirty seconds, he stood there and just looked at her. His expression was blank and admirably calm, given the situation, but inside there was nothing. His thoughts had just ceased once his eyes had devoured the sight. It no longer seemed to work and neither did the rest of him.

Not until, slowly, something replaced the numbness --- a horrified transfixion on the sight before him. He was fascinated and a part of him knew it was wrong, but he could not help it. He had never seen anything like this before, and it intrigued him as much as it terrified him.

He knew these thoughts were wrong, so he closed his eyes in a bid to rid himself of them, but it was to no avail. The image seemed to be imprinted in his memory with details vivid enough to match their real-life counterpart.

He opened his eyes once more and peered down at the grotesque thing that used to be a girl.

This time, he noticed something else on the ground, lying in a puddle of congealed blood and snow.

A lone bit of parchment that the boy swiped while his mutter's back was turned. There was but a name on the parchment, one the boy instinctively knew belonged to the now desecrated girl. He knew he would learn about her, one day. He knew he would learn what kind of monster had orchestrated this and he would try to understand. Then and only then could he really know how he felt about all of this. He knew he should feel horrified, but he felt next to nothing and it scared him. One way or another, he would know and he would feel. That was his promise as he peered down once more at the blood-soaked parchment in his hands.

*Wylla Nurmen*

"GAHHHH!"

Harry sat bolt upright in his four-poster in the Slytherin dorms. He was breathing heavily and his throat felt like someone had attempted to tie it in a knot. His chest wasn't much better and he could feel bile rise in his throat. He knew the sick was coming, but freeing himself from his sheets had become a task in and of itself. His fingers were as lifeless as the girl's eyes in his dream and they were as useless as the boy's who had dropped his pebble. Sweat gleamed all over his body, causing his bedsheets to stick to him like a second layer of skin.

He managed to pull free less than a second before the horrible sensation mounted.

His mouth opened on its own volition and his partially digested dinner violently rushed forth. It was unstoppable and the wet, splattering sound of it smacking into the stone floor was easily discernible. In a brief moment of lucid thought, Harry found himself especially grateful to Narcissa, despite his argument with Draco. She had taught him a very basic silencing ward over the summer. If not for his instinctual use of that spell, the entire dorm would have heard him projectile vomit in his sleep, and the experience was not yet over.

Exhausting his stomach\'s contents onto the floor around him did nothing to stop the heaving and his body continued to desperately attempt to expel his internal organs. All that came up was small amounts of bile as Harry choked on nothing. By the time it had finally ceased, Harry had been unable to draw air for some time.

Deep breaths wracked his body. He felt as though he had just run a marathon while being pelted by the very stones he had seen in his dream. Every part of him seemed to ache --- especially his head, which felt as though it might well explode from the pain. He was shaking as badly as the girl had in the dream. Every time he tried to hold still, his body seemed to go against his wishes.

He felt tears begin to stream down his face and he scowled. He had not cried in many years and he was not proud of this. None of this was anything to be proud of, but what the hell had he just seen?

He had seen it all through the eyes of the boy, but it had very clearly not been an ordinary dream. He had the distinct feeling that what he had seen really had once transpired atop that mountain. He thought he remembered the boy thinking of its name, though he could not remember. It was very clearly not one of his memories and it was something he hoped had been abolished long ago.

The crowd had been chanting something that Harry hadn't known, but the boy had. It had sounded German, but Harry somehow knew they had been calling for the girl's death.

He began to shiver violently once more as he thought of her and, unwillingly, he leant back over and added another considerable shower of his bodily fluids to what now resembled a stinking heap beside his bed.

He had thought nothing could be worse than the mutilated corpses he'd seen while at Nurmengard, but this put those people's fate to shame.

He had never imagined anything so grotesque before. He could not imagine a crime worthy of such a punishment, nor could he imagine anyone cruel enough to inflict such horrible damage upon a child.

Yet all in the crowd had thrown their stones.

All but the boy whose eyes Harry had watched through. A boy who Harry remembered reflecting on not yet being six. The boy had seen that when he was less than half of Harry's age.

Harry felt a pang of pity for the boy; this had destroyed him now, he could only imagine the effects it would have on a not-yet six-year-old child. They would be immeasurable and he could only imagine what something like that could drive one to become...

And then it hit him.

He was wearing the pendant --- he was wearing *Grindelwald's* pendant.

The crowd had been speaking German --- a language which had made itself known in the former dark lord's accent. His thoughts --- though jumbled --- had been surprisingly rational for one so young, something that indicated a startling amount of intelligence. If someone saw something like that at an early age... it was not at all difficult to see how they might have been driven to do unspeakable things.

It had been Grindelwald... the only outcome that made sense was that Grindelwald had shown Harry one of his oldest memories while sleeping. He supposed it was logical from a magical standpoint. If Harry could seek out his presence in dreams, it stood to reason Grindelwald could access the connection as well. He was also probably a master practitioner of Legilimency, which likely made the whole thing even easier.

The question was why.

Harry had an answer, one that terrified him and, to his mild disgust, intrigued him.

Grindelwald had wanted him to understand. He had wanted Harry to learn what he had truly fought for.

Perhaps this was his way of making him understand.

And, perhaps, even gaining the youth's sympathy.

Harry hated the fact that it was already working.

He conceptually knew that Gellert Grindelwald had done things more horrible than almost any person who had ever lived. He knew that the man had killed thousands and subjugated just as many. He knew first-hand that his methods were twisted and cruel, yet he still sympathized with him.

Yet even more so, he sympathized with Wylla Nurmen. Whatever she had done to earn her execution, she hadn't deserved that.

And he feared it was much worse.

A part of him knew that no seven or eight-year-old girl could ever do something deemed worthy of that, and a horrible suspicion was creeping up in the back of his mind.

He had to know, but he could think of only one way to learn and it was not something he was yet willing to do. Not after what the bastard had just put him through.

But if he was right...

If he was right, the current state of affairs in the world that he disagreed with more strongly by the day was much more egregious than he had ever realized.

Merlin, he hoped his hunch was wrong.

***September 18, 1992***

***The Headmaster's Office***

***8:02 PM***

Harry stood before the gargoyle guarding Dumbledore's office with a puzzled expression plastered on his face.

It had been a very long week. The dream he'd had days earlier still haunted his nightmares and he had been extremely distant with just about everybody since.

Not that it really mattered.

Draco had not so much as spared him a glance since their altercation the previous Sunday. Crabbe and Goyle went along with him, as they always did. Pansy also seemed to have sided with Draco, but Harry caught her throwing pained glances his way every now and then. Theodore spent all of his time in public with Draco, but he had snuck to Harry's table in a far-off corner of the library once or twice. The message was very clear, though it remained unspoken. Theodore would not abandon Harry as the others had, but he wouldn't publicly show his support and risk the ire of not only Draco, but the upper years --- who Harry was still more than a little bit worried about.

None of them had thus far made a move against him, but he could practically feel it building. Many of them just hated him on principle. His blood status, what he had done to a man who many of their families had worshipped as though he were some sort of god, and all he stood for hurt his case with many. Others had just seen the way he had fallen out with Draco and had assumed he must have committed some sort of faux pas.

He did not blame Theodore for playing it on the safe side and he appreciated his private support. He just hoped Cassie got back to him about those duelling lessons in a swift and prompt manner.

Not that he was thinking any of this right now.

He was actually quite befuddled. It had not been an easy task finding the entrance to Professor Dumbledore's office. It had taken the help of several portraits and even the Fat Friar, but he had finally arrived.

Not that it helped any. The gargoyle seemed to be in need of a password and Harry hadn't the foggiest of ideas what that might be.

He fished Dumbledore's letter from the pocket of his robes and read it over carefully. There was no password, but the postscript did capture his attention.

Surely not...

"Sherbet... lemon?"

He nearly smacked a hand to his forehead or let out an exasperated sigh when the gargoyle bowed and stepped aside. Harry swore the thing was smirking at him as he passed by and began ascending the long, spiral staircase that moved of its own accord and led up to an ornate oak door far above.

"Enter," called the voice once Harry had knocked, and he pushed open the door and stepped into Dumbledore's office for the very first time.

The office itself was large and circular. Many portraits hung on the walls. Harry would have had no idea who exactly they depicted, but golden labels on their dark frames told him they had all at one point been a headmaster or headmistress of Hogwarts. The largest of these frames hung behind Dumbledore's desk. It depicted a very old, very frail-looking man with wispy white hair that had nearly all succumbed to his age. Much unlike most of the horribly acting portraits, this one really did appear to be asleep.

There were many windows in the room and they offered a breathtaking view of the Hogwarts grounds. From here, one could see almost everything; from the vast, green lawns, to the lake --- which looked dark and deadly still at this time of night --- to the ominous and sinister-looking forest that sprawled out beyond all else, stretching on further than the eye could see.

The view was not the only interesting thing about the office. Instruments were strewn haphazardly about the room. Some lay carelessly on surfaces that did not look fit to hold them, while others rested snugly in cases or shelves. Some of these devices did nothing, while others omitted a soft whirring sound, and others still let out sporadic puffs of what seemed to be randomly coloured smoke.

A noise drew Harry's attention away from the instrument. He had heard nothing like it before. It was clearly the squawk of a bird, but it was unlike any other he had heard. Most were loud and obnoxious; the calling of crows came swiftly to mind.

But this one was different.

It was clearly a squawk, but it was like this bird spoke a language completely different from its brethren. An enchanting language of music and magic, for only through a combination of those things could one ever hope to hear anything so intrinsically beautiful.

The bird itself sat atop a golden perch off to the left of Dumbledore's desk. It was larger than most birds he had seen, though not massive like an ostrich. The bird could have been the most impressive Gryffindor mascot to ever exist. Its feathers were a crimson which perfectly matched the lions' Quidditch robes. Its tail --- which was as long as a peacock's --- was a bright, eye-catching gold; the exact same colour as its beak and claws. Black eyes met Harry's as the bird seemed to study him before letting out a strangely sad note.

"Beautiful creatures, phoenixes."

Harry's head snapped around. In the presence of such a magical creature, he had almost forgotten the man who must have owned it and the reason he had requested Harry's presence in the first place.

"Sorry, sir," Harry hastened to say. "I didn't mean to ignore you, or anything."

Dumbledore did not look upset at all; he was just smiling benignly. "Think nothing of it, dear boy. As I say, phoenixes are beautiful creatures. Most witches and wizards never see them beyond their depictions in all sorts of books. I have a great deal of respect for art, but I think you would agree after seeing Fawkes that not even the most skilled of artists could ever match a phoenix's majesty."

Harry knew at once Dumbledore was right. Being in the presence of a creature like Fawkes was entirely different from seeing one on the page of something like a textbook.

"Alas," said Dumbledore, "we are not here to discuss my loyal friend, but to discuss you and see what progress we might be able to make on our little project. I do not wish to keep you for too long. You have had a busy first two weeks, it seems. What, with a detention under your belt already."

"Ah," said Harry, trying to grasp for something to say.

He *had* earned himself a detention for the Cutting Curse he'd hit Ron Weasley with on the Quidditch pitch. Madam Pomfrey had healed him in minutes, but the fact still stood Harry had used a potentially dangerous curse on another student. He took some mollification in the knowledge that Weasley had not gotten off unscathed. Aberforth Dumbledore had given them both detention. Ron for cursing Pansy and starting the whole affair, and Harry for escalating things with more dangerous magic. The detention had not yet been scheduled, but it would take place at some point in the coming weeks.

"I have no interest in punishing you further, Harry," Dumbledore assured him. "Though I would advise you to avoid my brother's bad side in the future. Aberforth is a man of many talents, but controlling his temper has never been among them."

"I'll... keep that in mind, sir." He had an odd feeling that their Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher would not be terribly happy with his brother sharing tidbits about him.

"Please do. Keep in mind, too, that magic like what you used should not be used against others without very good reason."

Harry nodded. "Sorry, sir. I won't let it happen again."

"Very good. Now, I shan't make you wait any longer. You are here to learn Occlumency and I am here to teach you." The man steepled his fingers. "What do you know about Occlumency?"

"Next to nothing," Harry admitted with no small amount of bitterness. "Just what you told me, really. It stops people from using Legilimency and reading my mind. I've tried to find books on it, but I haven't really been able to."

He thought he might have had he really looked around in the Malfoy family library, but perhaps those books had been among those nearest the far wall Harry had been told not to intrude upon. He hadn't seen any in the rest of the room, though he hadn't looked too closely. He had looked around the Hogwarts library, but he had so far found nothing.

"I would think not," Dumbledore said quietly. "Occlumency is not something to be taken lightly." He pierced Harry with a deep gaze. "It is actually not legal to learn in the first place."

Harry's eyes widened. "It's---"

"Illegal in a sense, yes."

"What do you mean by in a sense, sir?"

"Well, you will find that, according to the Ministry of Magic, it is perfectly legal to know Occlumency and even to use it. Just as surely, however, you will discover, upon a bit of reading, that learning Occlumency is forbidden. The same way that buying books on the subject is illegal, as are selling them, but possessing them in the first place is well within the law."

"That... doesn't make any sense."

"To you, it may not. To a more seasoned politician, it is actually clever in many ways."

"Like what, sir?"

"Very few people learn Occlumency, Harry. Only the most important of people in the Ministry of Magic ever do so. Some of the lords of important Wizengamot families do as well, but even their numbers are scarce. Even fewer people who are neither of these learn of it. At Hogwarts, I think you will find that only two of the professors are well-versed in such magic beyond myself."

"Who are they, sir, if you don't mind my asking?"

"Aberforth and Severus. Minerva and Filius know of the basics, but I would not trust either of them to reliably repel a legilimens of any true renown."

"So... it's illegal, but you're going to teach it to me anyway?"

Harry was, of course, not opposed to this. He had made it onto the Slytherin team through bribery, after all, and countless Slytherins owned books that were less than legal. For some reason, Dumbledore just hadn't struck him as the type to so flagrantly violate the law.

"Why, Harry," he said with a twinkle in his eye, "I would never dream of doing such things. We are only here to discuss your extracurricular interests."

Harry's eyes widened briefly before he smiled broadly. "Of course, Headmaster."

"Very good. Now, let us begin working on that, shall we?"

Harry was not repelling any Legilimency attacks that first night. As a matter of fact, Dumbledore was not using any.

There were stages to Occlumency, according to the old man. The first stage was the understanding of one's own mind. Harry would go through a rigorous routine of meditative and discovery-based exercises which would allow him to isolate and understand his emotions. The idea was that he would be able to identify all of them as soon as they cropped up and easily internalize them. More than anything, he would gain a mastery over them. Once that happened, they could advance to actually repelling psychic attacks.

Harry found this more than a touch challenging. Mostly because these exercises necessitated the closing of his eyes. This would normally be a non-issue, but normally he would not see the broken form of a girl or her brains and blood every time he closed his eyes.

Dealing with that vision had not grown any easier in the past few days. He was at least past the point of vomiting and shedding shocked tears, but he still shuddered and became withdrawn every time the memories resurfaced. This made focusing difficult, which limited his success; something Harry was not at all happy with.

"That will do for tonight, I think," Dumbledore decided after more than an hour had passed. Harry sighed and leant back in his chair, opening his eyes and casting his gaze hastily around the room. He needed something to focus on that wasn't the blackness of his eyelids; that only brought forth the images he wanted to avoid so much.

His eyes eventually found the phoenix that had so entranced him upon his entrance, and he watched it with a vacant expression. The bird, which had been sleeping just seconds before, raised its head and met his gaze once more. It seemed to appraise him, tilting its head to the side before letting out a note more forlorn than any so far. It actually sent a pang through Harry's chest, as though it had a direct physical effect on him.

"Are you quite all right, Harry?"

Dumbledore's voice brought him back to the present and Harry shook his head slowly, blinking several times to refocus.

"I'm... fine, sir."

The old man tilted his own head much like how his bird had done a moment earlier. "How are you dealing with the events which took place at the close of your first year?"

"I think I'm pretty much over it, sir. I still wish I hadn't seen it, but... it's settled in now."

The bit with Grindelwald at Nurmengard had still haunted his nightmares before they had, this week, been monopolized by Wylla Nurmen --- but that was another matter altogether. A matter that, if Grindelwald was right, would not arise. The magically binding contract that had been triggered by taking the pendant back in the prison was supposed to keep that secret against even Legilimency. As for telling Dumbledore what had happened... that had never been on the table. The man would probably think he was crazy, or he would ask Harry so many questions he either couldn't or didn't want to answer.

Dumbledore pulled down his spectacles to examine him head-on with those deep, blue eyes. "Is there anything you wish to tell me, Harry?"

Harry kept his face completely blank as he deliberately shook his head. "Nothing, sir."

"Very well, then," said Dumbledore. "It does appear that time has not been considerate enough to slow down for us tonight. I advise you return to your common room, lest curfew draw too close."

"Harry," called Dumbledore just before the Slytherin stepped out onto the office's landing. "Do come to me if the answer to my last question changes. My door is always open to the likes of you."

"Thank you, Headmaster," Harry said with a bow of his head. "It means a lot."

And it really did, for very few adults had ever offered him anything similar.

The fact that one of the only others was a former dark lord... well, Harry wasn't sure what that said. And if that was true, he did not want to know what was implied by his growing urge to contact him and ask exactly what the hell had happened the night of his most haunting nightmare.

**I am just going to be upfront and honest from the start. The Mind Arts have been done to the other side of the Earth and back. Regardless of how I implement them, I will almost certainly be copying someone's interpretation, whether it is advertent or not.**

**It is with that in mind that I will be using a system relatively similar to the one in The Sinister Man's *Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin.* I will not be implementing the mind palace approach, but I will be borrowing a great many of his ideas. I won't go as deep into Mind Arts theory in this fic as I do in Ashes of Chaos, but I may still flesh out and rationalize the borrowed bits of his system a bit more. It won't be a carbon copy by any means, but I do enjoy a lot of the sub skills and the general system he employed and, once more, I am going to be copying someone no matter what. I might as well copy some of the best ideas I have seen and give the author the proper credit they deserve.**

***March 1, 1889***

***Schwöb, Germany***

***11:14 PM***

About five and a half miles north of St. Bartholomew\'s church and the beautiful body of water that was Lake Königssee, the innocuous town of Schwöb sat nestled in the shadow of a great mountain and a large river. The town was one of the older settlements around these parts, but one would not know it from a glance. It was small and did not look at all extraordinary. It could easily have been overlooked for the scenery around it. The mountain to its east cast the small town into shadow, and the water to its south would first draw the attention of any passing by.

Near the centre of this small town, a house stood among many others. There was nothing about it, either, that would make it stand out, but to the young boy tossing and turning in one of its bedrooms, it had been home for as long as he could remember.

He was not asleep, though he most certainly should have been. He had scarcely slept since the day he had watched Wylla Nurmen meet her gruesome end. He hadn\'t wanted to at first. His parents had been insistent, but he had argued. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw her blood stain the snow and her bones pierce her flesh. Worse still were the dreams. On the rare nights he managed sleep, he was plagued with nightmares. Some were of the girl and of the other horrific ways she might have died. Far more concerning were the dreams in which he took her place. Stones flew towards him at such an alarming rate, it was as though the crowd had simply hurled one of the many vast mountains towards him.

The former type of dreams bothered him, but they did little more than that. They woke him without fail and prompted pity for the girl. More than anything, they confused and frustrated him.

He knew that seeing what he had seen should bother him more than it had. Young as he was, he understood at least this to be true. People were not supposed to feel so little when they watched something so awful. He was unsure whether this made him good or bad. Was he better than others because he did not feel things they felt? Or, by that same logic, was he some sort of monster like from the bedtime stories his mutter would read to him before sleep?

These dreams also caused his curiosity to rear its ugly head and do its best to consume every last memory he had of the day, trying to devour any bits of information that might lead to exactly why it had happened. He had spent time rationalizing what he had seen to the best of his abilities and had come to a couple of conclusions.

What had happened had been planned. These people had known what would happen before it did. Even his mutter had not seemed herself that day, and the boy wondered if that might have been why.

More than anything, however, he just wanted answers.

Why had the crowd done something so horrible to a little girl? One who had been so afraid and helpless, and one who had died so easily and without drama.

It made no sense to him. Children were supposed to be protected; his mutter had always told him so. He was kept out of trouble by his parents and they always urged caution. They did their best to keep him safe, yet he had seen the girl\'s parents in the crowd. They had stood by and done nothing while their daughter met her brutal end, as stone after stone had pummeled the very air from her lungs and driven the last vestiges of life from her body.

The latter type of dreams... they were more worrying.

They pulled him more ruthlessly from Morpheus\'s loving grasp, not caring how badly they jostled and battered him in the process. He woke from these dreams with haggard breathing, hurried heartbeats, and a thin layer of sweat coating his body like the way the ice snugly covered the calm blue water of Lake Königssee. His sheets clung to him each night after waking from these dreams, sticking to him like the way the pearly-white snow had clung to Wylla Nurmen\'s dress through all she had endured.

He did not like the way he felt after these dreams; least of all when it paired with the burning curiosity the first sort of dream often left him with. He was a terribly curious child who read very far beyond his age level. The thing he hated most was not understanding how something worked. It irked him more than his young mind could ever put into rational terms and it was what, beyond all else, drove his borderline-unhealthy reading habits.

He had just awoken from one of the more horrible dreams he had experienced --- during which he\'d been pelted with stones until he could no longer move before being thrown from the top of the mountain down into the waters of Lake Königssee --- and now more than ever, he felt as though he needed answers.

He detached himself from his sheets and slid from his cot, putting on his night clothes and creeping from his room. His home was small and quiet, though he could hear the fire still crackling merrily out in the living room. He was sure this meant one of his parents was awake. They always put out the fire when they turned in for bed.

Sure enough, his vater sat in the high-backed chair nearest the fire, reading a book and paying mind to nothing else. His mutter was nowhere to be seen and must have been sleeping. He paused at the room\'s entrance and just peered from his vater to the fire. It cast its light over his face, making him look as though he had bathed in orange light and his skin glowed of its own accord. He sat too close for his face to be cast in shadow, though the fire did make his grey eyes stand out more starkly. They were bright, like gloomy clouds or especially thick mist.

The man must have heard him, for he paused in the middle of flipping a page. \"*Having trouble sleeping again, Gellert?\"*

Gellert nodded sheepishly. \"*Ever since I went with Mami to church the day they killed the girl.*\"

The man\'s grey eyes lifted to study his son for the first time. Gellert had always wondered whether the silvery-grey hew of his blue eyes had come from his vater. A part of him hoped it had. He had gotten little more from the man. His skin was not as fair as Gellert\'s, nor was his hair. Where he and his mutter had pale hair that shimmered in the barest of light, his vater had hair as dark as a midnight sea. He was tall and of a great mass; muscled so well he looked built for the farms. Gellert was still young, but he had always been of average height and quite lean. A part of him thought that would never change.

His vater, Johann, must have seen something in Gellert that concerned him. He put down his book without any mark of where he had stopped reading.

\"*Sit with me.\"* Gellert stepped forward and took the chair directly across from his vater, who continued to watch him like an astronomer might observe a peculiar star through the all-seeing lens of a telescope. \"*What is it that bothers you most?\"*

Gellert chewed his bottom lip before finally letting his curiosity and worry spill forth. \"*I don\'t understand, Papi.\"* His voice came out in a rush and he scarcely breathed between every hurried syllable. \"*You and Mami always said children were supposed to be safe! You always said no one should ever hurt them. But they did, Papi! They hurt her like I\'ve never seen anyone get hurt before and I don\'t get it! Why would they do that if children are supposed to be kept safe?\"*

Johann\'s expression had not shifted. \"*I sense there is more. You have always been curious, but it has never bothered you like this. What else is on your mind?\"*

\"*It... it scared me.\"* He had hardly realized it was even true until the words had escaped from him. Not until he stopped thinking about the situation had he realized what about it most troubled him. \"*I always liked being safe, but if Wylla wasn\'t safe, why am I? What\'s different? If they hurt one child, why not me too?\"*

Johann glanced over Gellert\'s chair and to the hallway that stretched beyond. Everything in the house but they and the fire were quiet, but he still seemed on edge.

\"*Come with me,\"* he said. \"*Get your coat on, we\'re going for a walk.\"*

\"*But Papi, it\'s so cold!\"*

\"*No arguing; do as I say.\"*

Gellert did as he was asked, following his vater out the front door and into the wintery landscape outside. It would have been a fair night had it not been for the wind. He wasn\'t sure what it was about the wind and the last number of weeks. It was like a plague that had befallen the land; one that spread and infested far and wide and refused to be cleansed, inflicting a ruthless vengeance on all who dared oppose it.

His vater\'s gloved hand rested on his shoulder as he steered him through the streets. The town was quiet at the best of times, but tonight it seemed positively abandoned. All was quiet but the wind that ravaged them and Gellert\'s occasional bouts of shivers. His vater did not react to the cold at all. He was an older man who had been hardened by his years. Gellert didn\'t know much of how his vater had been raised. The topic never seemed to come up and he wasn\'t terribly interested. He just wanted to play, hear funny stories, and the like.

It did not take him long to recognize the path they followed and soon they came to the town\'s centre. The space often recognized as such was a large field perfectly the shape of a square. It was the lushest of greens in the summer, but it was presently coated in a light layer of snow that had not yet started to melt. Gellert knew that in a few weeks, the square would be plagued by thick mud and running water, courtesy of the changing of seasons. For now, the white of the snow gleamed even in the night, as if the square was but a green cake coated precisely with the finest of white icing.

From the side they had entered, the road was exposed. It was often used by riders with access to a horse and carriage, though less so in these months. On the other three sides, the square was boxed in by squat, grey buildings; all of which were among the most important in the town. Their rooftops were also bright with snow, and they glittered prettily in the soft light of the moon.

\"*Such a beautiful place in the winter,\"* said Johann.

Gellert shivered and glared at his vater. \"*It\'s s-so c-c-cold!\"*

The man chuckled softly. \"*You must learn to embrace the cold. I have a feeling you might one day end up somewhere much colder than the vaterland.\"*

\"*Why did you bring me here?\"* Gellert found himself uninterested in his vater\'s words. He just wanted to be out of the cold. If not for the horrible dreams, he would have yearned for the warm embrace of his bedsheets just then.

\"*So we are not overheard.\"*

Gellert frowned. \"*Who would have heard us?\"*

\"*Maybe no one,\"* his vater admitted, \"*or maybe your mutter. I know you love her, but you should understand that some things are best not heard by her.\"*

\"*What things?\"*

He watched his son the best he could in the velvety blackness of the night. \"*Do you know what a witch is, Gellert?\"*

\"*Someone who can do magic.\"*

Johann nodded. \"*Anything else?\"*

Gellert thought about it, deep lines etched in his young face as he pondered. \"*Mami\'s church says that they\'re bad.\"*

\"*Not just the Church. Most people who believe in a god believe that witches are evil.\"*

\"*Why?\"*

The man shrugged. \"*You know how I feel about your mutter\'s church. I go to make her happy, but I don\'t believe what she believes. She knows it. It\'s caused arguments and fights, but it\'s true. I think that the religion she believes in says that witches gained their powers because they made a deal with the devil.\"*

\"*I... don\'t think I believe in God, Papi.\"*

\"*That is your choice. I will not tell you what to believe. I am only telling you why some people think witches are evil. You know that the people who believe in God often believe that the devil is the worst of all who have ever existed.\"*

\"*What does this have to do with Wylla?\"*

\"*Can you not guess?\"* Gellert shook his head. \"*She was a witch, of course.\"*

Gellert gasped, eyes widening. \"*But witches and magic aren\'t real!\"* he said with certainty. \"*They\'re just in stories.\"*

Johann watched his son very closely. \"*Some people believe that. Whether it\'s real or not doesn\'t really matter. People like your mutter said they saw Wylla doing magic. Her parents were the ones who reported it to the church.\"* This made Gellert angry in a way he could not entirely explain. He just knew that no parents should ever let something like that happen to a child, let alone be firmly behind it and watch it transpire. \"*Her own parents called her a witch. She was always going to die.\"*

\"*That\'s terrible!\"*

\"*It is, isn\'t it?\"* Gellert had never heard his vater use that voice before. His words cut like a blade and his voice carried the bite of sharpened steel.

\"*Papi... you said she was a witch, not that they thought she was a witch.\"*

\"*I did.\"*

\"*Do... do you mean it? There aren\'t really witches, right?\"*

Johann was still watching his son every bit as closely as he had been for their past few exchanges. \"*Witches are real, Gellert; so are wizards, and they are not evil. They are great. They have powers that normal people could never dream of, and it isn\'t because they made some kind of deal with the devil. It\'s because they\'re special and made for greater things. Wylla died because she was one of them and those people knew it. They might not even realize they knew it, but they did. They realized they would never be her, and so they got rid of her.\"*

\"*But... Papi, what if they thought I was a witch?\"*

\"*You would be a wizard, Gellert.\"*

He flushed even more than he had from the frigid, winter air, but that had in no way dissuaded his point. \"*What if they thought I was a wizard? They would hurt me, too.\"*

\"*They wouldn\'t.\"* His vater\'s voice had that bite to it again that Gellert had never before heard. His eyes suddenly looked less like mist or passive clouds and more like those that would bring forth a great and mighty storm. \"*I understand the truth about witches and wizards, and I would never let them hurt one.\"*

Harry found himself panting in bed once more, though no bile rose to his throat this time. Even without the nauseating imagery and scarring implications, experiencing dreams with such vividness that there was no doubt at all they were real events was an oddly taxing and extremely disorienting experience.

He cast his deep green eyes around the dorm room he still shared with Draco and could only wonder what on *earth* Grindelwald was playing at, for now, there could be no doubt at all it was Grindelwald. The boy\'s name was Gellert and everything fit together far too nicely for it to be anyone else. Harry could think of only one answer to the question of the man\'s motive.

He wanted Harry to understand.

What worried Harry most about that thought was that he doubted Grindelwald would have shown him any of this unless the one-time dark lord was beyond certain his memories would have the desired effect.

That made Harry shudder; just like how Grindelwald had shivered against the harsh, German winter.

If he was so beyond doubt, Harry could only wonder what horrors lay before him in the land of dreams.

***September 26, 1992***

***The Headmaster\'s Office***

***8:03 PM***

\"Your first few weeks have been eventful, I have heard?\" Albus asked his brother once the niceties had been observed. He had been late, as always, but the headmaster had made no mention of it.

Aberforth snorted. \"Eventful\'s one word for it.\"

\"And what word would you use in its stead?\"

Aberforth raised his eyes to meet his brother\'s; eyes so very alike his own that sometimes, he felt as though he was looking in a warped sort of mirror.

\"I\'m torn between baffling and enlightening.\"

Albus let out a deep chuckle. \"An oxymoron perhaps more reflective of Hogwarts than any other description I have heard in all my years.\"

Aberforth\'s jaw tightened and with it, the lines of his face seemed to deepen. \"None of this is a joking matter.\"

\"Oh, I do not joke, dear brother. Trust me when I say that I know your statement to be true, and I know better than any that the dichotomy is not always one that brings forth thoughts of happiness and optimism. What is it that ails you so?\"

Aberforth snorted again; it was a habit of his. \"Just know that I\'m not struggling to think of things. I\'m struggling to think of which thing to start with.\" Albus hummed in acknowledgement but did not interrupt. \"We\'ll just start with the whole bloody school, why don\'t we?\"

\"I am afraid you will need to narrow your focus by a smidgen if you would like me to have any hope of understanding what vexes you so.\"

\"It\'s a *mess*. Houses duelling on the Quidditch pitch, Albus? And they weren\'t just throwing around Stunners and Disarming Charms!\"

\"I am aware,\" Albus said through a great sigh. \"The divide between houses is something that saddens me very deeply.\"

\"But you\'ve had no problem letting that gap grow and grow? It wasn\'t nearly this bad when we were at school.\"

\"That was a lifetime ago, Aberforth. A great many things have happened since we were boys. Not least of which being the rise and fall of Lord Voldemort. That has raised tension between the houses to levels the school has not seen since the immediate years following Salazar\'s sudden parting.\"

\"But you still let it happen?\"

\"What am I or my professors to do? Any conflict on this scale requires a true resolution. You know that as well as I.\" Both of them knew the other was thinking of the time during which Aberforth would not so much as speak to Albus. Not before he finally took the necessary steps to move against the man who had been ravaging Europe for decades.

\"There was resolution,\" snapped Aberforth. \"He\'s dead, Albus. He\'s been dead for almost eleven years.\"

\"Yet little has changed. A clear divide still runs through the heart of our nation. Children are often the reflection of their parents. In many ways, they are but brilliant canvases their parents may paint their desired picture upon. If the parents are skilled in their art, they might paint a picture they are truly happy with. So long as the divide outside of this castle remains --- and even widens --- I am afraid there is little to be done.\"

Aberforth fumed quietly, but he knew the argument was lost. His brother would not acquiesce on the matter --- irregardless of what he said. He knew that the man had reasons he was not sharing. They were probably the true justifications for his lack of action, but he was clearly keeping them to himself. Albus had always liked his secrets.

The younger of the pair dismissed a number of other concerns in a similar vein. He sensed they would be met with the same vague dismissals, and his time was not a luxury he cared to waste away in front of his insufferably stubborn brother.

\"What of Quirrell?\"

\"What of him?\" asked Albus. \"He is dead.\"

\"You can\'t fool me the same way you can fool others. I know the way you hide skeletons, Albus. Out of sight, sure, but you\'ve never quite been good at getting rid of the stench, if you know where to find it.\" Albus frowned deeply but did not react. \"Something always happens to the poor sod who takes up my job. We both know the curse exists, which is why we both know I\'ll be resigning as soon as the kids start sitting exams. Anyone can hand out test papers; it\'s not hard.\" Albus nodded, showing he was indeed still listening. \"Quirrell disappears without a trace, the Longbottom boy dies, and Potter and the youngest Weasley end up in the hospital wing.\"

\"An eventful close to the year, yes. Neville Longbottom\'s fate was as tragic as it was innocuous. Masters Potter and Weasley did admittedly find themselves in the hospital wing because of Quirinus, but the issue was resolved swiftly enough.\"

\"So he landed two students in the hospital wing, then died, and you\'re just going to cover the whole thing up?\" He scowled. \"And that\'s assuming I believe your story about Longbottom --- which, for the record, I don\'t. I told you, Albus, you don\'t hide the stench well. This time, you basically just poured rat piss everywhere. It stinks like hell and leaves a clear trail. Following the rats will usually lead you to the answers.\"

\"No one will find them,\" said Albus, \"I have made sure of that.\"

\"At what cost, I shudder to think.\" Aberforth glared. \"So you\'re not going to tell me, then? Not even about why Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw all remember Quirrell as the worst professor the school\'s seen in years while Slytherin has nothing but great things to say about him?\"

\"Not at this time, no.\" His brother looked very tired. \"Please, believe me when I say this has nothing to do with keeping secrets from you specifically. If I ever believe it is integral for you to know---\"

\"You\'ll tell me the bare minimum,\" Aberforth grunted. \"I know how you work, you old crook.\" He huffed. \"What about Potter?\"

\"What about him, exactly?\"

\"Firing off curses that could kill at twelve?\"

\"I doubt Harry thought through the potential consequences of that action. To defend the boy, a Cutting Curse is almost never lethal---\"

\"Unless it hits the neck, which, for your information, was a damn close call.\"

\"I am aware. I have spoken with Harry about it, and he has given me his assurances he will not do anything similar again.\"

\"Not good enough,\" said Aberforth. \"The kid needs to learn his actions have consequences. It starts out as a cool spell or two, then they get interested in those spells. Then they start casting them, and it gets to their head. Once they stop caring, the problems really pile up.\"

\"You have a detention with the boy, do you not? Teach him whatever you like during that time.\"

\"Whatever I like?\" Albus nodded. \"Are you sure you want to say that, Albus? You would turn a blind eye to whatever I taught him, no matter the methods?\"

Albus\'s expression was pensive. \"Within reason.\"

Aberforth snorted for a third time as he pushed his chair back and climbed to his feet. \"I guess we\'ll see if what I have in mind is \'within reason\' or not. I plan to teach a lesson, and sometimes lessons aren\'t learned the easy way.\"

***Meanwhile, in an abandoned classroom in the dungeons...***

It had been a trying two weeks for Harry ever since his fallout with Draco. The rift between them still showed no signs of closing and he had spent more time alone in those two weeks than he had since being locked in his room on Privet Drive. He had spoken a few times with Diana, but only one of them had been what he would call a long conversation.

She had asked if he wanted her to do anything about Draco but he had told her no. It was the second time they had fallen out. If Draco could not apologize for some of the horrible things said on his own terms, then Harry did not deem the friendship one worth pursuing. It did appear that if that scenario did play out, he may well lose the other friends he had made --- which would be crushing --- but he would manage. Diana still supported him, and Theodore as well in private. Cassius was still in his corner, as was Cassie, who he was currently standing in front of.

They had arranged duelling practices on Tuesday and Saturday each week, and this was to be the first of them.

\"Sorry it took so long to get this set up,\" she told him, \"I know you\'ve been having some troubles with the upper years. I wish we could have started earlier, but I had to work some things out with being a prefect. It\'s been a bit of a shift.\"

That had been another thing. The upper years had been far more troublesome since his dissension from Draco and his group of friends. He was no longer so openly supported by someone coming from such a powerful family and much of the house still despised him --- both for being a halfblood and also for his title as the Boy-Who-Lived. If not for ten long years at the Dursleys, Harry might have been bitter over the whole thing. How could he help that his mother had not been a pureblood? And how it was his fault that Voldemort had been stupid enough to get himself blown up by some sort of sacrifical magic that Harry still only vaguely understood? But the Dursleys had given him much practice in ignoring things which were cruel or unjust.

What was more difficult to ignore was the outward showings of hostility from the older students. As of yet, it had not escalated too far. The worst instance had been quite a nasty curse that could have ended in disaster. It had made his skin horribly frail, and Harry had the impression that had he suffered any damage to the skin, it could have had disastrous consequences. Fortunately, he had been quite near to the hospital wing at the time, and Madam Pomfrey had taken care of the issue without much drama.

Their attacks did not help his stress. Dealing with the dream of Wylla Nurmen had been hard enough. Two weeks later, it still haunted almost every nightmare. Dumbledore had mentioned that Occlumency could be used to block out nightmares; however, Harry was unfortunately a long way from being at that level and it would be some time before that prospect became a viable possibility.

Between the schism with Draco, the trauma of the first Grindelwald-induced dream, the intrigue of the second, and the wrath of the upper years, Harry\'s second year at Hogwarts was not off to a favourable start.

Oh, and he was still being paired with Crabbe in Potions and had his detention with Aberforth Dumbledore next Saturday --- exactly one week from tonight. There were also those misfortunes to consider.

\"Don\'t worry about it,\" Harry told her. \"I\'ve had a lot going on, so I can only imagine your schedule.\" He was sure that, in actuality, she almost definitely did not have as much going on as he did, but he was willing to let her believe otherwise.

\"Well, let\'s start making up for lost time then,\" she said, gesturing for him to step closer to the room\'s centre. \"I\'ve reviewed everything you went over with Father in the summer, and I\'m actually really impressed. I wouldn\'t have thought someone your age could have done nearly as well as you have. We\'ll probably do a mock duel next time. Don\'t worry, I won\'t be aiming to do any damage, I just want a feel for exactly where you\'re at. We\'ll save that for Tuesday, though. I\'ve noticed how the upper years have been treating you, and it\'s been bothering me. I want to start you on something tonight that\'s going to actually help you against them.\"

Harry\'s ears perked up. \"What is it?\"

\"The Shield Charm,\" she told him. \"Not the Aegis Vocar variant you learn in first year. That\'s useless against anything more than a half-decent jinx. I\'m talking about the standard Shield Charm that aurors use. It\'s not taught until fifth year Defence Against the Dark Arts, so it will definitely be the trickiest thing you\'ve tried so far, but I honestly think you can do it --- with practice.\"

Harry\'s face set in a hard line that showed far too much determination on a combat-focused task for one so young. It spoke of how the last few months had aged him in a way that not even he realized.

\"Let\'s do it.\"

***October 3, 1992***

***Aberforth Dumbledore\'s Office***

***8:00 PM***

Harry had not mastered the Protego shield that first night with Cassie, nor the next. In fairness, they had spent little time on it that Tuesday. It was something he could learn on his own time. She would not waste time trying to help him learn a single spell when she could be teaching him a great many things. To some, it may have sounded harsh, but Harry was glad for it; it was the way he wanted it to be. Progress at the most rapid rate possible was the singular goal, and this was the best way of achieving it.

He had been battered after their mock duel that Tuesday. She seemed not terribly far behind her father in skill. Her spell selection wasn\'t quite as vast, but she was much faster than he was and moved with a grace he had never seen before. It felt to him as though he was trying to fight quicksilver. Her wand movements were as tight as the most well-tied knot, and she moved with the care and precision of a painter\'s brush.

The rest of the week passed as normal, though the attacks from the upper years had grown fiercer and more frequent. They were becoming more daring and Harry was beginning to feel a perpetual sense of foreboding every time he moved the halls. He wondered if this was how a small animal felt while moving through the layer of a deadly predator. It was not terribly dissimilar to how he had felt around Dudley in his youth, but he had not feared his cousin for many years. Dreaded him, yes; but feared him, no. Humans tended to fear the unknown and while Dudley\'s presence had become constantly worrying, he and his group of marauding morons had become as predictable as the hands of an old, grandfather clock.

It was fortunate that no spiteful students plagued him on the way to his detention. He doubted the professor would be forgiving of tardiness. Aberforth Dumbledore seemed a fair man, but he was doubtlessly strict and did not seem stingy when it came to dishing out his brand of law.

Harry was called into the office the second he knocked upon the door. He wasn\'t sure what he had been expecting upon entering, but a part of him had at least hoped he might learn more of the professor from his more privately guarded decor.

It turned out that physical reflections of what made this man tick were rarer than the finest of diamonds. The only thing of note Harry glimpsed in the entire office were two portraits.

One was small and sat atop his desk. It depicted two young boys with auburn hair and deep blue eyes. The older of them looked no older than ten. His brother looked even younger, but there was another, smaller girl with them that took him a touch aback. Her hair was blonde instead of her brothers\' red, though her skin was fairer and she had the same, blue eyes. Two figures stood behind them --- a man and a woman. Both of them were very tall. The woman had olive-coloured skin, brown eyes, high cheekbones, and hair as dark as any night. The father had his sons\' auburn hair and blue eyes.

The other portrait was much larger and it hung behind the professor\'s desk. It depicted the same young girl from the first, though there was something very different about her that Harry had found ominously off-putting. Aside from the fact she was obviously a number of years older, her expression was different. Not just the look on her face, but her eyes and even the demeanour she gave off --- even whilst in the form of a portrait. The blue orbs looked strangely vacant, as though they looked ahead but saw nothing; like they were drawn by someone who knew the colour but had never seen real eyes. Someone who could not possibly depict the life that was veiled behind the things humans used to see.

\"Enjoying yourself, are you?\"

Harry shook himself at the sound of the gruff voice and cast his eyes around once more, but this time not in hopes of learning more about his enigmatic professor. \"Sorry, sir, I didn\'t mean to offend---\"

\"Doesn\'t matter,\" the professor said sharply. \"Takes a lot more than that to offend me, boy.\"

Harry had noticed something odd now. Barring the professor\'s personal belongings and furniture, the room was completely empty but for him, Harry, and a small, braying sheep with wool as white as snow. He wasn\'t sure what he was to do in this detention, so he cast his eyes towards the professor, who was giving him perhaps the hardest stare he had ever seen.

\"Wondering what you\'ll be doing?\" Harry nodded cautiously. \"You\'ll be learning, that\'s what. It seems you like to throw dangerous magic around without thinking. You\'re young, but you\'re not young forever. There are consequences to your actions and those actions grow more impactful as you age. My goal is to make you think about what you\'re doing by showing you some of the consequences.\" Harry wanted to ask what exactly it was he would be doing, but the professor clearly saw the question on his face. \"You see this lamb, Potter?\" Harry nodded. \"You\'ll be killing it. With the exact same curse you used on Weasley. It\'ll show you just how easy it really is and what could have happened.\"

Harry\'s eyes widened. \"Professor, I can\'t---\"

\"Can\'t you?\" Aberforth snapped back. \"You had no problems using the Cutting Curse against Weasley. Hell, it was your first reaction. So what about the sheep?\" When he saw Harry would object, he levelled him with a glare. \"It\'s not a choice, Potter. You\'re going to stay here until this sheep dies because of your Cutting Curse. If it takes more than one detention, so be it. You\'ll come back every Sunday night and we\'ll see how you feel when the curse does its job as well as it really can.\"

This was utter madness. Harry couldn\'t believe a professor of a school was asking him to do this. He didn\'t want to kill the sheep. He hadn\'t wanted to kill Weasley. He had wanted to hurt him after what he\'d done to Pansy, sure, but not kill him. So what if the Cutting Curse had first come to mind? It wasn\'t as though he knew a vast plethora of spells that could cause pain. It was the easiest one.

The lamb let out a loud bleating sound that drew Harry\'s attention onto it once more. It looked up at him with wide, innocent eyes and he knew this was going to be more difficult than it ought to.

He pointed a wand held aloft by a shaky arm towards the lamb and closed his eyes. He did not want to be here forever and it would be much easier if his eyes were closed. He wouldn\'t see the spell make impact that way, nor would he see the way the light left the creature\'s eyes and left them as vacant as those of Wylla Nurmen...

No! He could not think of Wylla Nurmen or he would never get out of this detention.

He took a deep breath and entered into one of the meditative states Dumbledore had been helping him master for the purpose of practicing Occlumency. It helped drive all thoughts of Wylla from his mind, and he could feel the incantation forming on the tip of his tongue. His wand twitched but stayed the course, and it was building inside him...

\"**Come... come to me... let me rip you\... let me tear you... let me kill you\...\"**

Harry\'s eyes shot open as his breath escaped him in a startled gasp sharp as the finest dagger. His wand nearly fell from feelingless fingers as he whirled towards Aberforth. \"What?\"

The man just looked up from marking essays, annoyed. \"I haven\'t said anything, boy.\"

Harry was very confused. He certainly hadn\'t said it, and apparently his professor had said nothing either. There was no one else in the room. He was reasonably certain of that. He knew that the Headmaster could become invisible without need for a cloak, but he knew that had not been Dumbledore.

Which left only one viable possibility, one that shook him to his very core.

The voice had been inside of his head.

He began to shake as the implications of this washed over him like a destructive tidal wave.

Was this because of Grindelwald\'s dream visions, or had it come before? With horror, he remembered the way that he had thought about the Dursleys while locked up on Privet Drive. He remembered thinking of how, if the opportunity had presented itself, he had not been at all sure he would not have murdered the three of them. Petunia and Vernon, at the very least.

Perhaps the urge had been there for at least that long. Maybe Grindelwald\'s visions had made them worse. What if the dark lord sensed a murderous streak within him and sought to amplify it through traumatic visions, thereby bringing Harry onto his side.

All thoughts of contacting Grindelwald about the visions vanished from his mind in that instant. This had to be it. He would not let the man speak to him directly. Both he and Voldemort had proven exactly how persuasive they could be already, and he would not have it. He feared this voice, and he would not allow Grindelwald any more power over him.

\"Potter!\" barked Aberforth. \"What are you doing just standing there like a fool and staring off into space? Get back to it.\"

Reluctantly, Harry closed his eyes once more and tried to focus, but it was to no avail.

He stood stark still for the rest of the detention. After hearing the voice and fearing its implications so very deeply, Harry could not will himself to cast the spell against the lamb... nor would he be able to for many detentions to come.

***The Third Floor***

***9:49 PM***

Harry's week had been long ever since that detention with Aberforth. None of what he now presumed to be Grindelwald's memories plagued his sleep, but there were other visions. Wylla Nurmen still crept up every now and again, but he had a new recurring nightmare. A sinister, inhuman voice hissing in the back of his mind --- urging him to rip, tear, and kill --- and him listening, doing unspeakable things under the voice's persistent guidance.

There was plenty more to deal with in the waking world, as well. The upper years were growing bolder by the day, and Harry now spent his free time almost exclusively in the library. The positive of this was that he was making astounding progress in pushing ahead in his magical pursuits. The second-year syllabi for Transfiguration, Charms, and Defence Against the Dark Arts were suddenly looking laughably easy. The negative was that the isolation was getting to him. It wasn't even really being alone. He enjoyed solitude when it was self-imposed. When it was forced upon him, it reminded him too vividly of the years he had spent on Privet Drive; years he would never be able to look back on with anything more than spite and bitterness.

He had just finished yet another Occlumency lesson with Professor Dumbledore. He was making great progress. The man said he was improving rapidly and that, in time, they would be able to actually begin aiding Harry in repelling presences from his mind. Even just being able to force his mind to a state of calm had come in handy often this past week. It was an apt counter to the memory of voices only he could hear, but it was not something he had yet managed to accomplish while under a great deal of stress. It still required a fair amount of focus, so the ability could not simply be called upon at one's every whim.

He wished it could.

Had that been within his capabilities, he would have done it the moment a jet of light soared past his head. It missed him by mere inches and he knew at once he had reacted in the least ideal way imaginable.

He had frozen where he stood.

Two figures stepped out from behind suits of armour and Harry recognized them at once. They had been two of the more vocal Slytherins in opposing him. One was Marcus Jugson, a sixth-year Slytherin who was the pseudo-ringleader of a pack of boys who had resorted to making Harry's life a living hell. The other was Martin Macnair. He was a fifth year and what he lacked in skill, he made up for in vicious cruelty.

"Going somewhere, Potter?"

"The common room, if you don't mind."

"And if we do?"

Harry didn't have a good answer for that and both of them knew it.

They did not wait for an answer.

As soon as he hesitated, twin jets of light flew towards him. He had scarcely enough time to recognize colours before he dove to the side and summoned his own wand from its holster with a swift flick of his wrist. He leapt back to his feet and was immediately spared by luck. A curse missed his shoulder by less than an inch, followed by a Cutting Curse that managed to graze him. Fortunately, it was only a graze. It opened a gash on his shoulder that burnt like the sting of a dozen bees, but it was not terribly deep --- nor pressing.

He feinted to the right and Macnair bought it. He tripped up Jugson and his bid to block Harry, and he knew he had his chance. Harry's wand rose and flashed towards the more talented of the two, who had stumbled and was trying to right himself. The incantation for the Cutting Curse formed on his lips, but at the last second he froze.

***"Come... come to me..."*** Harry remembered with a shudder. ***"Let me rip you... let* *me tear you... let me kill you..."***

He hesitated as the words went through him with the suddenness and immediate impact of a lightning strike. His body even ceased as though that had been the case while his brain tried to rationalize everything. Thoughts of the voice brought back thoughts of Aberforth's insinuations of all that could have gone wrong on the Quidditch pitch and, more pressingly, Wylla Nurmen's blood staining the snow with the deathly crimson glow of her mortal essence.

Pain wracked his midsection and Harry felt weightless for seconds before impact unlike most things he had ever before felt wracked his entire body. He was on the floor and he didn't realize for some time how he had come to be there. Eventually, he realized that his hesitation must have cost him, one of them must have gotten through a Knockback Jinx or something similar.

"Fucking filthy mudblood piece of shit!" snarled Macnair, bearing down on Harry with his wand raised. "Tormensia!"

Harry felt every bone in his body rebel against whatever Macnair had just cast upon him. It felt like each of them had taken to painfully grinding against its nearest counterpart, as though trying to reduce their counterparts to fine bits of powder.

"No!" Jugson screamed, and Harry felt the curse lift. "Not in an open corridor, you idiot! The boy will scream and draw attention! If you're going to torture the little shit, at least drag him into a classroom to do it and silence the door."

"What are we waiting for, then?"

"It's too late now," said Jugson. "Somebody will have heard the bang. Come on, let's go."

The two of them sprinted off in the opposite direction and Harry struggled badly to retake his feet. He had desperately hoped that no one else would come; he had no desire to be seen like this. No one did, which was either extremely fortunate or extremely unlucky. He knew at once that at least two ribs were bruised. Moving was a task and even breathing sent sharp stabs of pain up his side, as though someone had poked his very skeleton with a flaming hot iron.

He needed to be better than this.

He needed to sort out whatever the hell was going on in his head and continue to improve. One would not do without the other in check. This had been a painful reminder of that, and it was one he would be heeding.

...but Merlin, would tuning out the memory of that horrible voice be a task, and that was saying nothing of its potential return.

Harry hoped it stayed away.

***Later that night...***

He sat at a central table in the dining room of their small family home. A chessboard sat between him and his mother. His father was away and he would not return for some days, maybe even a week.

The clouds outside seemed to mourn the man's absence with Gellert, who was more disappointed than he would care to admit about the fact his father had missed his birthday just days earlier. The clouds outside were as grey as colourless fabric and they did a great job of ensuring no sunlight fell upon them from above. Snow fell in its place. It was late in the year for such snowfalls, but the sky seemed to have forgotten this fact. Gellert had never seen so much snow later in the winter and he worried for his father, out farming in such horrid conditions.

His mother moved a chess piece and set it down with surprising force. She had been quiet and had scarcely spoken to Gellert since Wylla the witch had been pummelled to death by all those stones. The departure of his father hadn't seemed to help matters. She'd indulged him in a game of chess, but it was clear it was more out of obligation than anything else.

His mind focused more on his mother than on the game as he moved his own piece. He wondered why she had spoken to him so little. He wondered why she seemed so distant. He hadn't done anything wrong when Wylla had died, as far as he could tell, and had been well-behaved ever since, too. She had no reason to be upset with him --- or anyone else, really --- but she was, and it had him more than a touch confused.

"Check," she said dully.

Gellert looked back at the board, startled. He had made a number of careless moves without thinking, so lost in thought he was. He examined the pieces and their positions and quickly realized that he was in a losing battle. He could extend the game, but he would inevitably fall to a swift checkmate unless his mother made an especially foolish mistake.

It frustrated him more than it should have.

Not so much losing at chess. He was extremely competitive and he was very annoyed at that, but the habit was one he had worked on over the years. Both of his parents had told him he needed to become better at dealing with losses and not act like a child after they took place. He had gotten a bit better at that, but the loss wasn't what really bothered him.

It was losing track of thought.

It had happened so frequently since Wylla Nurmen's death and the conversation with his father. The nightmares had receded some since their nighttime stroll, but in return, the thoughts seemed to plague him more in his waking hours. They seemed as unshakable as a shadow on a bright sunny day and Gellert could not be rid of them --- no matter how hard he tried.

His mind had just focused on it so many times.

He did not understand.

Why should Wylla have died just because she had powers that the rest of them didn't have? Why should anyone die for being better than others? If someone dies, it should surely have been because they had done something horrible? Being born with magical powers seemed quite the opposite. It seemed to Gellert like being born the wealthiest man around. He would want nothing more than to have those powers, and it seemed terribly unfair to kill children for such things. Even at his age, he felt odd about it.

He was strangely affronted by it and all of his feelings were coming to a head inside of him. They were swirling in his very chest like vengeful storm clouds, coiling tightly like an angry viper and coalescing with some resistance, like water and fire yielding a piping hot wall of steam.

Bangs could be heard all around the dining room as his mother let out a terrified scream. It took Gellert a moment to realize what had happened but when he did, his eyes widened in transfixed puzzlement.

All of his mother's pieces had leapt straight from the board with impossible fervour. A few had jumped straight upwards and bounced hard off the ceiling. Some of them had fallen to the floor, others bouncing all about the room, and a few had even clattered off the window like fast-flying bugs.

Gellert and his mother had stared at each other with wide eyes and both of them seemed to come to the same conclusion at the same time.

Gellert realized what he had done. The words of his father came back to him and he could scarcely believe them, even now.

 *"Witches are real, Gellert; so are wizards, and they are not evil. They are great. They have powers that normal people could never dream of, and it isn't because they made some kind of deal with the devil. It's because they're special and made for greater things."*

He had moved the chess pieces without touching them. He hadn't wanted them to move, but he knew it was true. Losing the game had been what had made his mind travel to less desirable places, and it made sense to his young mind that it had triggered a reaction.

Did this mean he was a wizard? Had his father known this all along? Had that been why he had told him out in the town's square as opposed to in the comfortable living room of their quaint and cosy home? Had this been why the man's eyes had watched his son close as a predator might its prey as he had told the tale of magic and murder?

Gellert did not know, and he certainly did not have time to contemplate such things.

He felt pain lance through his scalp all of a sudden. He looked up, startled, and froze at what he saw.

His mother's pale, shaking fist was full of his hair as she dragged him to his feet. There was a look on her face he had never seen there before, but he had seen *it* once.

In the faces of those gathered around the church; those who had thrown stones at the helplessly bound witch who had died from those injuries.

*"Mami!"* Gellert cried. *"Mami, what are you---"*

His voice was cut off when her hand, which seemed so large to him, found its way over his mouth. She tried to pull him down the hall, but he kicked and screamed.

Fear had gripped him now, tighter than the jaws of a lion. He remembered all of the horrible dreams. The ones in which it had not been Wylla chained to the church, but him. He remembered the sight of stones flying towards him as though he had truly lived the memory.

He kicked, and flailed, and squirmed, and bit, and tried to fight, but it was no good. He was much too small and much too young. When dragging him no longer became viable, his mother simply scooped him up into her arms like she might a basket of dirty clothes. He tried to thrash, but she was much stronger than he was, and before he knew it he had been carried into his room and thrown onto his bed. The door slammed hard and he bolted to his feet, intent on opening it, but he couldn't.

His mother must have been leaning against it, else she had put something on the other side to stop him from opening it.

Gellert flopped down on his bed. Tears blurred his vision until it looked to him as though his room was cloaked in a heavy fog, and sobs wracked his body so intensely that it looked as though he was having a fit.

All he could think of was the way his mother had thrown the stone, the way Wylla's parents had done nothing, and what it might mean for him in the days and weeks to come.

***October 14, 1992***

***The Grounds of Hogwarts***

***7:57 AM***

The sunlight flowing down from the sky above still seemed as bright as a raging supernova to Ron, even though he had been bathing in its glow for some time now.

His robes billowed around him as though they were flowing water, and his hair whipped back in the wind, which buffeted against him like they were jousting.

It was very rare that Ron Weasley awoke so early. He could hardly believe he was awake at all. He wouldn't have been, had it not been for Cedric Diggory --- who had proposed an early-morning flight around the grounds in light of the then predicted good weather.

Ron had agreed and they had met up in the entrance hall that morning at seven. They'd departed the castle on their brooms, taking to the sky and cutting through the frigid autumn air like a knife through the butter as they soared high above Hogwarts. The aged castle looked strangely more impressive from above, as their eagle-like perspective could now drink in all of its majesty.

The two had flown for some time before Cedric gestured for them to put a halt to the fun. Breakfast was fast-approaching and they both had lessons first period. Ron flew towards the ground with him and they circled each other on the way down, laughing as they tried to fly tighter circles than the other until their feet touched down.

"Thanks for coming out, Ron," said Cedric. "It's been a shame we haven't gotten to speak much since school started back up."

Ron could agree wholeheartedly. His spat with Malfoy and Potter out on the Gryffindor had resulted in him being followed around and pestered at every passing moment for the next couple of weeks. It turned out that getting nastily cursed by the Boy-Who-Lived turned one into a sort of overnight celebrity. Ron thought he would have enjoyed the attention had it been for different reasons; he always had when it had been because of anything involving Quidditch.

"Nah, no problem," said Ron. "It was actually a good laugh. Next time, let's maybe do it at any other bloody time on the clock, but it was fun."

Cedric laughed as the two boys made for the castle's front entrance. Even from outside, the smell of bacon wafted out from the Great Hall.

"Anything interesting happen since school started?" Cedric asked. "Except for the drama with Potter and the other Slytherins."

"Just me wanting to hex a bunch of gits for following me around over it. Made me realize I didn't know enough hexes, actually." Cedric sniffed amusedly. "Other than that, not really. What about you?"

"Even less than you, I'm afraid. Us Hufflepuffs tend to not start full-blown duels on the Quidditch pitch. Just Quidditch, really. I've been made the house's starting seeker, but I'm sure you knew that."

Ron did, of course. "Congrats on that, mate."

"Cheers, Ron."

"For the record, I didn't *want* to start that duel. I just... I couldn't let Malfoy just call Hermione that."

"So he did use the word, then?"

"Yup --- wanker, he is." He scowled. "Not sure Potter's any better. I thought he might've been all right, but bloody hell. That curse could've killed me if he had aimed a bit lower."

Cedric eyed him carefully. "Something's bothering you. Any time you talk about that or seem to think about it, you get tense. What's up?"

Damn Cedric and his keen eye. There was a reason he made an excellent seeker despite being far from the most naturally gifted flyer to ever attend Hogwarts.

"I just felt useless," Ron admitted. "Potter shot that curse at me and I didn't know what to do. Not even just that. Spells were flying everywhere and I froze. It wasn't even because I was scared, I just didn't know what to do. I borrowed a couple of books from Percy on defensive magic over the summer, but they're not good enough. I've never actually duelled; I've no clue what I was doing. I never really thought I'd need to."

"Most people don't, to be fair," Cedric assured him. "Most never get into a proper duel in their life."

"Have you?"

Cedric fidgeted. "Well... yes. My father always said I needed to know how to duel. I got lessons these past two summers. Nothing super intense, really. Just basic self-defence stuff."

"Can you teach me?"

The question was blurted so hastily, Ron hadn't even paused to consider its implications. Why would Cedric take time out of his schedule to teach some second year? He could feel his face flushing as soon as the question was asked but --- to his surprise --- Cedric did not immediately shoot his request down.

He looked upon him with a critical eye. "Is this... actually something you want to learn? It's not some passing fancy because of what happened with Potter?"

"I wanted to learn it before that," Ron said eagerly. "Like I said, I borrowed books from my brother over the summer. I really do want to learn."

And he did. It ran much deeper than spells traded on a Quidditch pitch and a nasty cut courtesy of the best student in their year. The desire ran back further and its roots could be easily traced to a dark set of tunnels far beneath the castle; treacherous tunnels in which Ron Weasley had seen one of his best friends for the final time.

Cedric seemed to consider. "All right," he agreed after some pause, "if you're sure. Just the two of us, or do you mind if others get in on it? I know Susan would love lessons. She was begging her aunt for them this summer, but Madam Bones wouldn't give her any. She told her maybe in a few years, but Susan doesn't think they'll ever happen."

"I don't mind company," said Ron. "Hermione and I sit with Susan and Hannah in Herbology. They're a good sort; we just don't get much time to talk."

Cedric nodded just as the two of them stepped into the Great Hall, thus necessitating their departure from one another. "Tell you what, Ron. I'll talk with Susan and Hannah and try to find a decent classroom we might practice in. I'll get back to you if I find any."

Ron grinned, hardly daring to let his hopes rise as he made his way towards where Hermione sat near the end of the Gryffindor table. This might well be the first step to ensuring he would be weak no longer.

***October 16, 1992***

***The Potions Classroom***

***9:00 AM***

Harry was one of the first to the Potions classroom that Friday morning. He took his customary seat at the back of the class and pulled out a book on Transfiguration theory he had taken from the library. It was more complicated than any he could read, but he found it actually improved his wandwork and he needed distractions nowadays.

The dream about Grindelwald and his mother had strangely been the most disturbing one yet. It had come the very night of his beating at the hands of the upper years. Madam Pomfrey had been able to heal him easily enough, but the dream had affected him infinitely more than the curses that came before it.

There had been no horrible violence like what he had seen when Wylla Nurmen's skull had been cracked as easily as an egg and her body flattened like a pinecone that had been trodden on. There had just been an eerie and terrifying psychological shift. Grindelwald's mother had been quiet and distant before, but to see her switch from caring mother to something so deranged and single-minded had both terrified and infuriated Harry.

The sudden shift was terrifying, but the behaviour was something he had come to expect. It was not at all dissimilar from something the Dursleys might have done in that same position. For the first time, he wondered whether Grindelwald may truly understand him. It was a very worrying thought, but it made a disturbing amount of sense. Perhaps that was how his words had touched Harry so deeply. If they were not dissimilar, he might have known what to say. The more troubling possibility was that he hadn't needed to think and had spoken naturally.

If that was the case... Harry might need to do even more soul searching; which was something he had painstakingly avoided ever since hearing voices that first detention with Aberforth. In the one sense, he had just stood there for the allotted time, unwilling to so much as think of trying to slaughter the sheep that sat before him.

Harry heard a bag set down beside him, but something felt odd. He glanced to the side and did a full double-take. "Greengrass?"

The tall blonde girl had slid gracefully into the seat beside him; the one that was supposed to be occupied by Crabbe --- his designated partner, courtesy of Professor Snape.

She frowned. "I thought I told you to call me Daphne. We spoke for hours on the train, didn't we?"

Harry blushed. "Sorry, you... surprised me."

She shrugged. "We haven't gotten a chance to talk since then. I thought this was the perfect chance and time. Especially now that Draco isn't just hanging off of you at all hours of the day."

That was an interesting description. Harry had always felt as though it was him hanging off of Draco, but Daphne might have been right. Any time they were separated, it had usually been because Harry had needed space. He supposed he just viewed himself as a follower since it had been Draco who had introduced him to the magical world, but maybe that hadn't been true. Hell, perhaps that had been the cause of their separation. Perhaps Draco had realized Harry had grown out of his role of follower and the boy was uncomfortable with their evolving dynamic.

"You took your time to come find me," he accused with narrowed eyes. He didn't trust just anybody. Let alone someone who approached him in a way that seemed as blatantly opportunistic as this.

Daphne gave him a pointed look. "Do keep up, dear," she said with a roll of her eyes. "You and Malfoy argued for the entire end of last year and then you just showed up at Hogwarts in September like nothing had ever happened." She gave him a pointed look.

"You... thought we might make up again?"

She smirked. "There we go. If you haven't noticed, I don't exactly love Draco. He's..."

But what Draco was, according to Daphne, Harry did not find out. Snape had entered the room. Harry took the chance to glance around for the first time. Crabbe was sitting at a table with Goyle, though he was staring at Harry awkwardly. Harry just shrugged, but Snape did not miss the oddity either.

"Potter!" he snapped. "You are to partner with Crabbe, as I have made painstakingly obvious already. If you disobey my instructions again, it will be detention."

"Excuse me, sir," said Daphne politely, "but I was actually the one who chose to sit with him. His partner hadn't arrived yet."

Snape's eyes bore into her, but Daphne did not so much as flinch. "And why would a sensible student like yourself do such a thing, Miss Greengrass?"

"Well, Professor, I've noticed that he hasn't been doing well in Potions lately." Harry pulled a face, but he knew it was true. Partnering with Crabbe was difficult work. He wasn't naturally gifted at Potions as it was and Crabbe was worse than useless. Harry spent most of the class trying to make sure the boy didn't cause a catastrophe. It left him little time to even focus on brewing. "It's one of my best subjects, sir, and I thought I could help out a housemate. I can move if you'd like, but I'm always happy to help someone who's struggling."

Harry looked at her with a strangely hurt expression for all of a second before his brain caught up and he realized what she was doing. Her own visage was almost too polite, too perfect. Whatever Daphne's intention had been, it was not to ensure Harry had a better Potions grade, nor was it to avoid embarrassment for Slytherin House --- which was how many in the classroom seemed to have taken it.

Snape did not look at all pleased, but he knew he couldn't object. A slight bias against Harry was one thing, but handicapping Slytherin and slighting one of its more well-respected students in Harry's year... he was never going to do such a thing in front of the Gryffindors.

"In the future, Miss Greengrass, your generosity is not needed. You are a very gifted student who should not waste that talent on the likes of Potter. You may do as you wish."

Snape set them to work on that day's brew and Harry quickly became awed by the proceedings.

Daphne had asked him to prepare the cauldron while she fetched the ingredients. Her return had then led to a lengthy lecture about the importance of studying the available ingredients and selecting only the best of the bunch. She spoke of all kinds of things like cross-contamination and less than ideal conditions for some of what they would be using to rest in.

After that, they had begun brewing. Most aptly, Daphne had begun instructing Harry on what to do. For a moment, he had almost argued.

"Daphne... it says to stir clockwise, not counterclockwise."

She had only grinned at him. "Good reading, Harry," she said with a mischievous glint in her eyes. "Maybe leave the brewing to me for now, though. We'll get you there one day."

His jaw hung slack as the potion skipped its next stage entirely, completely voiding three steps in the process and immediately putting them miles ahead of the next furthest group in the class.

Harry argued no more after that.

It was the smoothest a brew had ever gone for him and at the end of class, he couldn't help but peer suspiciously at Daphne in a way that made her raise a brow.

"What is it you want, Daphne?"

"A friend?" she asked, seemingly puzzled. "Why is it so weird that I'm just being friendly? The Malfoys might view you as a tool, but that doesn't mean all of us do."

"W-what?" stammered Harry, blindsided.

She just gave him a hard look. "I'll let you work it out, for now," she decided. "Think on it and get back to me. I'll be in the library at lunch, but you're welcome to sit with my friends and me at dinner if you'd like."

And with that, she was gone, her words ringing ominously in Harry's mind.

*"The Malfoys might view you as a tool, but that doesn't mean all of us do."*

***Malfoy Manor***

***10:00 PM***

The ancestral home of the Malfoy family stood tall and imposing against the velvety black sky. It was made of wood so dark that it blended with the night so seamlessly it might not have been there at all. No light shone from any of its windows, and an outside observer would think all in the house was quiet.

That was not the case.

If one left the entrance hall and followed a slightly confusing sequence of corridors, they would find themself in front of a heavy oak door that would lead into a room that had not been used in almost eleven years.

Until tonight.

The room would have been bright had heavy black curtains not been drawn across its large, clear windows and had it not been the dead of night. The presence of curtains meant that not even moonlight flowed in through the windows, thus the only light that lit the room were the torches. They were hung in ancient brackets made of what appeared to be bone, spaced conservatively along the room's four walls.

A long table dominated much of this place. It was made of wood as dark as that in the home's exterior. It bore a small number of torches that cast the faces of the table\'s few occupants into shadow in the low lighting of the room.

The man at the head of the table leant forward. The torchlight washed over him. His bright blond hair gleamed like a winter's snow and his face was lit as brightly and suddenly as a pale lantern. His grey eyes seemed to somehow be brighter, too, as they observed the other three men at the table.

One had short brown hair and a hard face with a number of scars. He looked the oldest of the bunch, and his eyes were both the darkest and the cruellest. Another man had blond hair, like the host's, but his had a golden hue to it. The fourth man's hair fell to about his shoulders and it was as black as the night outside. His eyes were grey, but they were dark and seemed somehow fierce.

"My friends," said Lucius Malfoy from the head of the table. "After many years, we meet in this room again, and I trust the three of you know I would not have called upon you without... developments to report on." The air seemed to thicken until it was denser than any gas. "I have news that must be acted on at once, and I humbly ask for each of you to help me in your own way. Should we form a plan that works, I have no doubt we will be rewarded." His lips curved upwards into a smug smile. "After all, I am sure our lord will be most pleased."

**I know Harry hasn't been as present in these last few chapters but trust me, that will change. This is just a very down point in the year during which JKR did nothing canonically. I am filling it, to an extent, but I don't want to create a subplot with Harry that is going to take up a ton of words; not with the Grindelwald memories already in play. Outside of that, I am using this time to further subplots not involving Harry and giving you a look into the minds of some other characters. I hope the slight shift has been enjoyable, but worry not --- our main attraction will step back into the limelight in due time.**

***Königssee, Germany***

***11:57 AM***

Gellert sat alone in a vast, dark room. The ceiling was towering and the walls were wide, giving the place a cavernous sort of feel. High upon one wall, a massive window of stained glass let in a limited amount of light; just enough to cast patches of shadow sporadically throughout the room.

His shoulders ached from the painful position the chains around his wrists forced his arms into, and Gellert felt his stomach rumble for what must have been the hundredth time that day. He had been trapped here for four nights now.

The day he had been bodily thrown into his room had been a long one. He had contemplated escape, but it had not been possible. He had gone to bed afraid and confused, but even his worst expectations had utterly failed to match the horrifying reality that had violently greeted him in the middle of the night.

He had exerted so much energy in his panic that, by the time night had begun to fall and the fingers of light began to retract back over the horizon, his body felt like it weighed double its usual weight. It was as though great mounds of sand had been poured into every limb, for he could barely move by the time his head hit his pillow.

That exhaustion explained why he had not heard his bedroom door open in the middle of the night.

He had woken when he felt hands on him, but it had been too late. His hands and feet were shackled together by heavy chains and he was carried off once more; though this time, he was marched straight out of his home by men in hoods and loaded into a horse-drawn carriage.

He had been brought to St. Bartholomew's church. He had never been to the site in the dead of night, but it was impossible to miss. Especially now, after it had greeted him in so many nightmares. It was, after all, the very place that had hosted Wylla Nurmen's gruesome execution.

Gellert had been dragged through the church and thrown into the room he now resided in. Days had passed but he had not been allowed to leave. He had seen neither his mother nor his father --- nor anyone else, bar those who brought him water a few times a day. He had not eaten anything and his stomach had been writhing constantly, like a pit of a hundred vengeful vipers.

He had slept once since arriving. It hadn't been terribly long after he had come to the realization he likely wasn't going to be let out. He had closed his eyes and fallen asleep at once. It had been as fast and as easy as blinking his eyes...

Until the dream.

He dreamt of being hauled from the room by the same men who had taken him from his home. The sky outside was cloudy, but the air was warm for the time of year. Snow was beginning to melt and cracks were showing on the ice that covered the surface of Lake Königssee. It was a windless day, and as far as the weather went, one might think it a good one.

But Gellert knew better, for he was not focused on the sky, or the snow, or the glass-like surface of the lake far below them. Nor even the mountain peaks around them, still lightly coated in snow like massive cakes with their white icing slowly thinning and melting as the temperature warmed.

No, his attention was not captured by any of that, but rather by the group of people who formed a tight semi-circle around the church, just as they had the day Wylla Nurmen had been put to death.

They carried no weapons and there was no stack of stones that Gellert could see, but he knew those things mattered not. He knew at once what was happening; knew that the worst of his nightmares since the girl's execution was coming to life right before his very eyes.

The atmosphere was unmistakably hostile; even young Gellert had no trouble deciphering that. The gathered crowd muttered indiscernibly, but Gellert did not need to hear their words to know what it was they were saying. Their tones spoke volumes --- it was like the buzzing of a hundred feral bees.

Gellert was not led to the wall of the church, like Wylla had been just weeks earlier. He was led out into the centre of the clearing enclosed by the group of blood-thirsty observers. In it, a stake taller than Gellert and made of a dark-looking wood stood; it gave off an oddly malevolent air all on its own. In front of it, more wood lay. A pile of logs, stacked and organized in a way that was clearly deliberate.

As Gellert came closer and closer to the stake, the crowd's muttering rose. His bare feet felt cold as a freshly fallen snowflake. The stone floors of the church had been one thing, but the snow covered grass outside was another. Just because it was warm for the time of year didn't mean that his feet did not feel as though they had been suddenly plunged in icy cold water.

The crowd's roaring neared a crescendo as Gellert was forced to stand atop the stack of logs. Somehow, he knew he was dreaming. He knew he was dreaming because otherwise, there was no way he would have stood still and let the two men bind him to the stake as the crowd's all too familiar chants filled his ears like the most warped and twisted song the birds had ever sung.

*"TOD! TOD! TOD!"*

His feet stung from the heat as soon as his skin made contact with the wood of the pyre. The logs were not just hot to the touch, it seemed as though there was a great fire lit just beneath them.

It took Gellert several moments to realize that exact analogy was, in fact, his reality.

One of the bottom-most logs caught ablaze and Gellert let out a yelp of pain as the heat surged and he could feel the skin on his feet begin to blister. By now, he was bound by his feet and his ankles to the stake against his back. The heat began to rise. The flames licked hungrily at the pyre of logs, slowly and steadily engulfing all the matter between it and Gellert. His heart raced as the flames drew nearer and nearer to his bare skin. He could already feel that some of the skin was burnt just from the heat alone; he could only imagine the damage that would be wrought by the wrath of direct contact with an open flame.

The fire came closer and closer as Gellert's heart beat faster and faster. The closer the fire came, the faster his heart raced. It was as though the flames were some sort of warped, crimson conductor, prompting his heart to beat with all the fury of a frantically played set of drums. Every beat rang through his body and seemed to reverberate off the walls of his chest and stomach. The frenzied thumping was so powerful and so intense that Gellert thought he might be sick, or that his chest would simply cave in at any moment. It didn't feel like his heart was beating. It felt much more like someone was beating furiously against his heart for all the muscle ached.

And then, the fire reached his feet.

It was pain not unlike a simple burn, but much more intense. Gellert had somehow expected it to burn deeper than the skin, but if it did, he was so distracted by the pain at his body's surface that he didn't notice. He tried desperately to shuffle his feet in an effort to gain any form of relief, but he couldn't --- he was tied too tightly to the stake behind him. Even if he wasn't bound, he had nowhere to go. The entire pile of logs was ablaze now and the flames were slithering their way up his legs, burning away at his flesh as they went; suddenly Gellert found he had no thoughts of being nervous or afraid. Even the glimpsed sight of his mother in the crowd meant nothing to him. All he knew was pain.

Yet it was not the sizzling of his skin that troubled him the most. That felt tame in comparison to the other horror brought upon him by the sudden rush of heat and fire.

Thick, grey plumes of smoke billowed up from the burning pyre, like the darkened steam of the great locomotive he had seen barrelling down the town's tracks time and time again.

The first cloud of it that reached his face caused a fit of coughing and a painful stinging in his eyes. The second brought those feelings to an unbearable intensity. Soon, there were no waves --- just a constant stream of acrid smoke that seemed intent on drowning him in its oppressive fumes.

His eyes no longer felt as if they were stinging. It was now as though someone had taken a red-hot skewer and used it to prod his corneas. He could not so much as open his eyes, and even that wasn't the worst of it. His throat had coiled and constricted like some great serpent. The muscles seemed to have been tied in a knot so tight that it allowed for not even the barest traces of air to slip past their tightly constructed wall of muscle and flesh. Gellert's chest heaved in want of air, but he inhaled nothing but even more smoke. He felt the horrible need to cough, and felt panic rise once more despite the pain when he could not will himself to do even that.

The fire had reached his chest now and it was no longer creeping. It seemed to be moving with a speed inspired by sadistic pleasure. Every part of him it touched burned like he could never have imagined. He chanced a glance down and managed to spy what must have been his skin, but it was blackened and certainly not solid. It was streaming down his body like spilt candle wax. Somehow even more horrifying was the fact that he could no longer feel pain in his lower limbs. It was as if he was looking at someone else's burning limbs, but the stabbing in his lungs painfully reminded him that the melting skin did indeed belong to him.

Bile rose in the back of his throat and he tried to expel it, but it was met with the constricted wall of flesh and muscle that was preventing air from entering his lungs. He wretched, trying to draw in air and force out bile, but he couldn't; black spots were dancing before his eyes now, growing larger and larger as the crowd's roaring turned from malicious to victorious...

And then he was awake with a gasp, shaking and gulping down air like a dying man who had been long deprived of water. Every part of his body shook as he glanced down towards his chest. His skin was there and intact, but Gellert had the strangest feeling it might not be that way for long.

Something about that dream had felt different. For all the fear he had felt, never had there been an overwhelming sense of panic. It had more so been that he was afraid to feel the pain. The strangest thing about the whole ordeal was that at no point during the dream had Gellert felt any urge to flee or escape. He had felt... resigned. He still felt resigned now, though to what he didn't know.

That dream had been days ago now and he had not slept since. It was hardly an experience he wanted to repeat. Nothing even remotely similar would be at all something he would want to go through, so he had stayed awake --- resigned to whatever would come --- not bothering to hope for a rescue from his mother or father.

A high and loud squeal filled Gellert's ears as the room's large door opened, causing the hinges to creak horribly.

Two men entered the room. Gellert felt his heart begin to quicken when he recognized them. They were the same men who had taken him away from his home, and they were the same men who had led him out to the pyre in his dream.

As they unbound him from the wall, dragged him to his feet, and began to march him out of the room without so much as a word, Gellert knew he should feel panic, but he didn't. He felt eerily calm and his mind was as clear as the water streaming beneath its icy confines far below in Lake Königssee. He scarcely felt more awake than when he had been dreaming. It was as though he was watching from the perspective of an observer for how detached he was.

It came as no surprise when he stepped outside to a cloudy sky, warm air undisturbed by wind, or the soft dripping brought forth by melting snow and its remains streaming down the side of the mountain. Nor even was he surprised by the tight semi-circle of ravenous observers watching his every move.

He did not look to the centre of the circle. He somehow knew the pyre would be there. Instead, he searched the crowd for his mother's face. He found her quickly enough. She had his bright blond hair, and many of his own facial features were recognizable on her as well. Her eyes seemed to be constantly drifting, but they never did quite find him until she must have felt his stare upon her.

The look in her eyes was one he had never seen before. The soft light that seemed to perpetually dance behind those eyes like the rays of the sun on smooth water seemed to have gone out. There seemed to be no life behind them. It was as though she was only half there, and Gellert knew all at once that she would be no help to him.

Something burned deep in the pit of his stomach. It was not fear --- his heart had not yet begun to beat with the ruthless intensity he had felt during the dream. It was a different feeling that he had never felt in this way before. Sometimes, late at night, he would think about Wylla Nurmen and how and why she had died. Those thoughts often caused a feeling that was not terribly dissimilar to this, but it was hardly comparable.

Tears suddenly threatened to leak from the corners of his eyes, but they were not born of fear, or pain, or even sadness. They were born of something more raw and vicious. He thought whatever this emotion he felt was very much like anger, but it was somehow more than that. He did not know the words, but he realized as he was being led to his death that he was angry with his mother. Angry with her for dooming him to this, and angry at her and all the others who had thrown stones at Wylla Nurmen just because they were nothing compared to her.

He hardly even realized he had stepped onto the pyre of logs until the familiar pain began ebbing its way into his feet. None of the logs had yet caught fire, but he knew it was but a matter of time. Thin swirls of smoke rose from beneath the stack of logs, rising and twisting in the air like demented steam. Not the sort that rose from enticing meals, Gellert knew. These swirls promised no salvation or comfort, only pain and death.

He thought he ought to be more nervous. His heart had well and truly begun to speed up now, but it was reaching nowhere near the levels of rapid pumping he had experienced during the dream. Though that was changing as the logs began to heat up beneath him. When the first tendrils of fire snaked their way up and lit one of the bottom-most logs ablaze, Gellert's mind and body seemed to catch up with the situation at hand and he felt a sudden weight in his bladder as his breathing became more ragged; unbidden thoughts and memories of choking in the impenetrable clouds of smoke rushed forth to the forefront of his mind.

A scream sounded, echoing off the mountain peaks all around them. For a moment, Gellert felt confused. The pain was building and his feet were beginning to blister, but despite that, he did not remember screaming. He couldn't imagine why anyone in the crowd would scream. They had all been so gleeful through his persecution, and he could not imagine what might change that.

Until he saw him.

Gellert's eyes were drawn to a break in the semi-circle where a number of figures had seemingly fallen. Through the divide in their ranks, he spotted a face he was sure he'd never see again. It was the opposite of looking at his mother in a great many ways. The man's brown hair was darker than Gellert's, but his blue eyes had the same silvery hue as his son's. Where his mother's eyes looked hollow, emotionless, and void of any light or life, his father's seemed to burn with the intensity of a hundred roaring fires.

He had a peculiar-looking stick of wood in his hand. It appeared to be about a foot long and was dark and well-carved. Gellert had never seen anything like it before in his life, but he had read about similar objects depicted in some of the tales he had read, oftentimes not long before going to bed. It reminded him of the wands from those tales and his jaw fell agape when the stick of wood was aimed at him, and suddenly, the blistering pain in his feet seemed to ease. Where the skin had already suffered damage, the pain did not waver, but the fire suddenly seemed incapable of consuming any more of him.

The crowd seemed as confused as Gellert until one of them cried out something the young boy did not understand. Suddenly, they were all turning to rush at his father. Gellert felt the urge to scream for the first time as fear for the man he loved more than any other rose within him like a helium balloon.

Yet there was no need for it.

His father spun on his heel before any could reach him and disappeared with a loud *CRACK!*

Gellert's mouth fell open despite his own predicament. The act proved an ill-thought one. Smoke had begun to billow upwards in thicker clouds and he inhaled a large mouthful of it. True panic surged inside of him for the first time that day. He remembered his dream, the way every muscle of his chest had seemed to contract and tighten, his body's fighting need for oxygen with the vigor of a charging bull as he suffocated on the smoke that surged from the burning pyre. Fear gripped him now and he began to thrash against his bindings for the first time. The exertion wasn't helping his cause. Black spots were dancing seductively at the corners of his eyes, but thankfully, he didn't have to endure for long.

As though in a dream or from far away, Gellert thought he felt his binds release. He knew he was falling forward, but he was too weak to catch himself. He just hoped that he fell off of the pyre and onto the melting snow all around it. Anything was better than kissing the flames still burning fiercely at his feet.

He wondered if the latter might indeed have happened when oxygen was deprived from him for a second time. He felt like he was being squeezed through a tube much too narrow to accommodate his body. Pressure seemed to close in on all sides and not an inch of him was safe from its tight grip. He wondered if his mother had been right about the afterlife after all, and whether or not this might have just been some great tube leading to the heaven he had never believed in, but he succumbed to the darkness before he could find out.

Harry awoke shivering and gasping in his bed, shaking like a leaf caught in a strong autumn wind.

Whilst taking deep, calming breaths, Harry reflected that the vision he just witnessed may have been the worst of all the dreams Grindelwald had thus far shared with him. The first vision concerning poor Wylla Nurmen had been by far the most gruesome, but this one had been different. Though Grindelwald had not been burnt at the stake, the dream he'd had about that very thing happening had been more vivid than any dream Harry could ever remember having.

Well, any dream not forced upon by the one-time dark lord.

Experiencing the panic and agony that dream had brought on had been something entirely different. It was not nauseating in the same way watching a little girl pummeled by a volley of stones was, but it was grim and terrifying on a level completely of its own.

Yet, for all the pain and horror Harry had witnessed, that was not the thing that scared him most.

The thing that most scared Harry was that after watching all he had seen thus far through Gellert Grindelwald's eyes, he was starting to see why the notorious dark lord might have thought starting a war against muggles to be a worthy cause.

***A Hidden Room***

***8:30 PM***

It had been more than a week since Ron and Cedric had discussed the idea of practicing defensive magic with their friends. All had agreed it was an idea worth pursuing; that had been the easy part. The hard part had been finding a place to do it.

It had been Susan who had put forth the idea. She apparently spent large periods of time exploring the castle, and had come across a hidden room. She said the way into the kitchens is what had given her the idea. She told Ron and Hermione that to enter them they needed to tickle a certain bit of fruit in a portrait hung on the wall, so she had started trying similar things with other portraits in the surrounding area. Her exploits had yielded nothing for some time, until she had come across a particular suit of armour by happenstance.

She had been looking all over the suit of armour for some kind of oddity that might indicate it was hiding something when she had accidentally knocked the sword from its hand. The loud clang of the steel colliding with the stone floor had been worrying, but it had not been what made her jump. What made her jump was when the depicted knight bowed to her, retrieved its sword, and stepped aside, revealing a passageway that Susan had never seen before.

It was dark and led to a room with no door. Since the room was protected by a secret passageway, she had supposed it didn't need one. The room was large, dark, and completely barren. No decor was in sight, nor were there any form of windows. A scarce few torches flickered in a conservative number of brackets hung along the wall. The room was a bit smaller than the ones they used for lessons, but when she showed it to Cedric, the older Hufflepuff had deemed it more than sufficient for their purposes.

Cedric had placed the small number of privacy spells and wards he knew upon the room that night when they all arrived. They fortunately did not need to send the knight's sword flattering deafeningly to the floor to gain entrance. Simply removing it from the suit's grasp sufficed, so they entered the room with little drama.

Ron and Hermione had been told of the room in advance, but the former realized immediately upon entering that Susan, Hannah, and Cedric had done some remodelling. There were more torches than he had expected, and even some spheres of magical light floated about the room. There was a couch along one wall and two armchairs nearby, as well as a small number of desks in the room's corner. Most of the space remained open, obviously intended as the space they would use to practice.

"Did you make those?" Hermione asked Cedric, gesturing to the furniture.

"I did, yes."

"Isn't that really advanced magic? I've heard they don't even teach conjuration until sixth year. Aren't you only in your fourth?"

"Well... yes, I am, but I do study hard and Transfiguration has always been my best subject. With enough work, it really isn't all that impressive."

Susan punched him in the arm. "Come off it, dork." She looked at the others with a roll of her eyes. "He conjured the magical lights, too. I'm not even sure if we get taught how to do that here."

"Cedric is a genius with Transfiguration," Hannah piped up. "Professor McGonagall says he's one of the most talented students she's ever had."

The boy in question was blushing to the roots of his hair now. Ron had always scoffed when people told him he blushed as bright as his hair. He had always doubted the possibility of such things, but Cedric was beginning to make him reconsider that assessment.

"I'm no Transfiguration prodigy," he argued. "Conjuring all of this took me days. We could have been in here last Sunday had I been able to pull it off earlier." Ron smirked when Cedric seemed to notice that none of them looked at all convinced by his act of modesty.

"Since he's such a genius," said Susan with a sharp grin, "how about he starts our first lesson, huh?"

"I'm *not* your professor," said Cedric. "This is a group effort. We'll all be doing as much as we can to help each other improve."

"Mate," said Ron, "we all appreciate the nice guy act, but can we get on with it? You promised to teach me spells. Can we skip this rubbish and get to the important bits?"

Their collective laughter broke the tension all at once and Cedric's uncomfortable air vanished as he drew his wand and straightened his posture, clearly ready to begin.

***The Great Hall***

***8:22 PM***

Harry watched Draco enter the hall with Theodore, Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle that morning and had to resist the urge to frown. He was sitting with Daphne, Tracey, Millicent, Lillian, and Blaise. The few days of awkwardness between him and everyone else in the group that wasn't Daphne had passed, but part of him still felt like an outsider. Hardly a surprise considering he had felt somewhat of an outsider among Draco's friends, too. The concept of friends was just not one he had yet become completely accustomed to.

He liked Daphne and her friends more than he had expected. Daphne herself was outgoing and charming. She seemed to possess a deadly amount of charisma and had an uncanny ability to make people like her. She was also probably the most intelligent person Harry had ever met. It was strange that her wandwork was actually subpar in Transfiguration and no better than average in Charms because she knew the theory in each of them as well as he did. Her best subjects --- outside of Potions --- were the ones they wouldn't start until next year; that being Ancient Runes and Arithmancy. She seemed to be a sort of prodigy in both. That coupled with her obscene ability to process information quickly and accurately was what had caught Harry's attention early on. The fact he could not for the life of him seem to beat her at chess only added to the air, though that bit annoyed him more than he would care to admit.

Tracey was much more introverted but, when she became comfortable, she had a dry, cutting sort of humour that Harry found both amusing and endearing. She was in many ways the opposite of Daphne. She had a respectable amount of talent with a wand, but her theoretical work was average at best. Though obviously intelligent, she seemed to Harry like the laziest of the bunch.

He didn't know the other three as well. Millicent and Lillian only sometimes hung around, and seemed to follow Daphne around like a pair of lost puppies; Blaise Zabini was extremely quiet. He was a tall, dark-skinned boy with dark slanted eyes and short-cropped black hair. He was very athletic-looking and seemed to always have the hints of a smirk playing at the corners of his lips. Tracey had mockingly reflected that Blaise must just be part of some kind of perpetual joke the rest of the world had not yet been made aware of.

Harry had eased slowly into the group over the past week and a half. Daphne had practically carried him through many conversations at the beginning, but the others had eventually warmed up to him. He was still very conflicted about the entire situation, but there was no doubt as to one benefit of it all. Since aligning himself with the Greengrass heiress, the older purebloods who had been targeting him had all seemed to cease their attempts. They clearly had no desire to make an enemy of House Greengrass. That part was nice, at least, but it made Harry think of the words Daphne had said to him at the end of that first Potions lesson during which they had worked together.

*"The Malfoys might view you as a tool, but that doesn't mean all of us do."*

The statement made Harry feel a bit guilty for the relief he felt at being, for all intents and purposes, sheltered by Daphne's name, as well as making him wonder whether her words had been true.

Did the Malfoys view him as a tool?

They had all been nothing but kind to him with the exception of his two major arguments with Draco. Even after each of them, Diana hadn't stopped speaking with him and it seemed like neither Lucius nor Narcissa bore him any ill will. He supposed it was possible. He didn't fail to remember the way Diana had stopped Draco from putting his foot in his mouth a number of times during that first meeting, but that could really just be chalked up to Draco being Draco and Diana being responsible.

Harry was conflicted about the whole thing. He never had understood why Diana was so willing to spend so much time and effort on him and his problems. If she were manipulating him, that would be a logical explanation. Yet at the same time, she had never given him any council he had not found immensely beneficial. She had even helped him in dealing with Draco. It was possible she had guided him down a path she wanted him to walk down, he supposed. He wouldn't discount the possibility --- especially not now, whilst Grindelwald was showing him exactly how powerful such guidance was --- but he didn't see a motive.

He didn't see what the Malfoys could possibly want with a halfblood from a family traditionally opposed to their own. His Wizengamot vote when he came of age, he supposed, but this seemed a disproportionately large amount of effort to spend on votes they could likely just buy elsewhere.

Now that Daphne had planted that treacherous weed deep in the soil of his mind, he could not help but overanalyze everything. The way Diana had spoken so carefully when discussing things like blood traitors and bigotry. Or the way Draco had needed to be saved in conversation by both his sister and Pansy on a number of occasions. Or even the way Lord Malfoy seemed to have taken to him with unnatural speed.

He could not decide yet, but he would be more watchful. Not that he was entirely certain Daphne didn't view him as a tool. She may have been intelligent enough to pull off some kind of manipulation, which only made him more wary; especially after the recent collapse of his relationship with Draco. But for now, she and her friends were the best he had and he was enjoying their company. He would proceed as he had been and would just be certain not to let his guard down.

The ceiling high above reflected an overcast sky. The clouds seemed to grow thicker for a moment, but they were not clouds at all. Just the many beating wings of dozens of owls flying into the hall and bearing all sorts of letters and parcels for their owners. Hedwig was among them this morning, easily distinguishable by her dazzling white plumage and the way it stood out against the dull greys and browns of her many feathered companions.

The envelope she delivered was unmarked. Frowning, Harry reached for it and broke the seal, only to withdraw his hand just in time to avoid it being covered in a thick, yellowish-green liquid that stank worse than the petting zoo he had visited years ago while attending his muggle primary school. The smell was difficult to describe, but it was vaguely reminiscent of petrol.

Daphne stood quickly. She grabbed both Harry and Tracey by the arm and hauled the both of them to their feet. Blaise had risen at once and Millicent and Lillian were now scrambling to avoid the thick, viscous flow of the horrid-smelling liquid. A couple of students nearby hadn't been nearly as lucky. Some of them were covered in the stuff. Wherever it touched them, their skin had blistered horribly and was now beginning to swell just as bad.

Harry's heart pounded in his ears as he watched the scene before him with a numb some sort of detachment. Whatever had been in that envelope had been meant for him.

His eyes searched the Slytherin table, seeking out all who were staring at him. There were many sets of eyes and Harry met each of them briefly before he felt... something and did a double take. Damian Travers's older brother was among the many who stared at him. Harry remembered the way he and his friends had tried to attack him last year, but they had been stopped by the then Head Girl, Gemma Fawley.

Merlin, it had been a while since Harry had thought of her. She'd helped him so much, but he could not say he held any love for her. Not after she had been the one to give him the portkey which transported him to Nurmengard and became the root of the horrible visions he saw most nights now.

When he looked at Travers, he felt... smug? It was strange because he had no reason to feel smug, yet he did. His eyes narrowed just as Travers looked away. He had a bad feeling about him... and just when he had thought the upper years might have finally decided to leave him alone.

"Bubotuber pus," Daphne hissed in a venomous whisper. "That stuff isn't something to play around with. Whoever sent that isn't exactly your secret admirer."

"I've noticed that, yeah." Harry looked from the screaming victims of the pus, to Snape --- who was swiftly striding towards the source of the commotion --- to Daphne, who stood beside him looking pensive. "What is that stuff, anyway? Bubo... whatever you called it."

"Bubotuber pus," she repeated. "When diluted, it's used for a few things, but one of the most common is to treat acne." She scowled; Harry thought the expression failed to suit her face. "When it isn't diluted..." she gestured vaguely in the direction of those covered in the stuff, not needing to go on.

"Aren't you just Mr. Popular," Blaise said softly. A smirk actually was on his lips now, though it was a thin and discrete one.

Harry made to quip back, but he became distracted by Daphne. She was very carefully wiping all traces of pus away from the envelope with a number of napkins. Harry quirked a brow, but she ignored him, pocketing the now safe envelope.

"There are things that can be done with this," she said, "ways we might actually find who sent it."

"Find who sent it?"

Daphne fixed him with a hard stare. "I'm not sure what it was like in Malfoy's little clique, but I take it personally when someone tries to hurt any of my friends. I plan on finding who sent this."

Harry glanced around to make sure no one was listening before leaning into Daphne's ear. "Maybe start with the older Travers."

It was a mark of her composure that she did not seem even a bit taken aback by the comment. Her eyes just briefly flicked towards the boy. Knowing Daphne, she was probably quickly and accurately committing his face to memory.

If it was the case, she nodded. "Leave it with me," she said. "I'll come up with something."

***October 31, 1992***

***The Great Hall***

***6:00 PM***

The hall was luridly decorated in the typical muggle fashion one might expect on the final day of October. Daphne did not look pleased about it, nor did Millicent and Lillian. With the exception of a few snarky comments by the Greengrass heiress and a number of very testy glares sent around the hall by Millicent, none of them outwardly complained about it. Harry wondered if Draco and Theodore were cursing it all just as vehemently as they had last year.

Dumbledore stood to his feet, drawing the attention of all in the hall. His robes were a deep black this year as opposed to the vibrant orange he had dawned exactly a year ago. It seemed the man was unable to wear normal robes as these ones were not only trimmed in the aforementioned colour, but they were covered in a number of pumpkins of that same colour. They were all jack o\'lanterns and they must have had the same magic as portraits. Their bright eyes roamed the hall in an amusing yet unnerving way. To complete the image, Dumbledore wore a tall, pointed wizard's hat the same colour as his robes.

"Happy Halloween to you all," said Dumbledore. "Or, for those of you who still stick steadfastly to the old ways, I hope Samhain has treated you well. Seeing as we do not seem to have any caretakers or trolls set to interrupt us this year, I think it is high time the feast begins!"

Dumbledore swept his hat from his head with a theatrical gesture, and food and drinks of all kinds appeared on every available bit of table. The man smiled and took his seat, and Harry too could not help but silently reflect how much more peaceful this Samhain seemed to the last.

***Meanwhile, in the dungeons...***

"Remind me why we're going to this... what's it called again?"

Hermione sighed. "A deathday party, Ronald."

"Right, that. Why are we going?"

"Because it would have been rude to say no."

On the way back from practicing with Cedric, Susan, and Hannah that first night, Ron and Hermione had been stopped by Nearly Headless Nick --- the Gryffindor ghost. He had invited them to his six-hundredth deathday party on the 31st of October. It would be taking place at the exact same time as the Hogwarts feast. Ron had been less than keen, but Hermione had graciously accepted before he could get so much as a word in.

"I think I'd rather a ghost think I'm rude than miss the feast," Ron muttered, mind full of all the mouth-watering that were doubtlessly sprawled across all of the house tables even as they spoke. "Why didn't you ask the Puffs to come, anyway? Would've been nice to have more living company."

"Oh, come on, Ron, isn't it obvious?" He just stared back at her blankly. "They're not Gryffindors and Nick didn't invite them. What right do we have inviting them to someone else's party?"

"What right do you have making me miss the feast," he muttered, but Hermione didn't respond, for the door loomed ahead of them.

Ron's stomach rumbled and he hoped that this 'deathday party' at least had some decent food for its guests.

***About two hours later...***

The Great Hall was filled with the cacophony of scraping benches as all the students took to their feet, some more easily than others. Many of them were happily weighed down by the copious amounts of food they had consumed. Harry was amongst them as he followed his housemates from the hall. When they exited, his brows rose as he saw Weasley and Granger clearly on their way... somewhere.

Harry heard the red-head curse colourfully as they passed him by. He was muttering something about how he couldn't believe he had missed the feast. Harry hadn't noticed his absence, but it was odd. Weasley was no Crabbe or Goyle, but he was well-known for his appetite. Him not being at the feast seemed strange somehow.

He and the other Slytherins were about to make their way down into the dungeons when a horrible scream pierced the air. It sounded like all the cries of the fabled Greek river Acheron had come to life and let forth their anguish in one unified cry of complete and total despair.

Everyone from all four houses froze all at once. The school stood collectively still for what must have been ten long seconds while they waited for any more noise from above. More screams came and as one, the school seemed to decide that they were all suddenly much too curious and no longer weighed down by food and drink.

Many of them took the stairs up two and three at a time, shoving past each other to try and get to the front of the queue. Harry saw Crabbe and Goyle buffeting people out of the way left and right and suddenly wished he was in their wake. Millicent wasn't doing too badly at that herself though, so Harry and his friends made good progress, even if they weren't the first into the hallway.

He noticed the water first. It was everywhere, covering the entire corridor in a liquid layer several inches deep. It seemed to come from nowhere, yet it was everywhere and it stunk unnaturally. The next thing Harry noticed was yet another pained wail.

He looked up towards the source of the sound and saw Filch on his knees in front of a strange-looking torch bracket. Harry could not ponder why the man had decided to kneel in the water, nor why he was screaming. At least not until Daphne gasped from beside him.

"Merlin," she muttered, sounding all of a sudden quite breathless.

Harry looked more closely, now confused, and his eyes widened once they saw what he had missed the first time. His blood ran cold at the sight. What he had thought to be a strange-looking torch bracket was far more sinister. Mrs. Norris, Filch's cat, hung limply from the bracket, looking as lifeless as a puppet with its strings having been cut. It was clear now why the cantankerous old man had been shouting bloody murder for the entire castle to hear, but that was not what most drew Harry's attention.

Upon the wall --- beneath the bracket and limp body of Mrs. Norris --- were sinister words written in a crimson smear that looked altogether too much like blood. Harry was sure it was indeed blood; he had seen enough of it in his dreams to identify it by now. The crimson writing spelled out an ominous message. Harry didn't understand a word of it, but it still somehow made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.

***October 31, 1992***

***The Second-Floor Corridor***

***8:19 PM***

Harry stared blankly at the wall as the crowd around him began to buzz. Muttered conversations broke out like hissing wildfires, rapidly rising in intensity as though their flames were being carefully stoked.

Enemies of the Heir, beware...

What did it mean? Heir as in the heir of an Ancient and Most Noble House? Harry couldn't think of what other context made sense here, but that didn't seem quite right. Why would some rich pureblood be going around writing threats on a school wall? It seemed somehow beneath them. Draco might, if he had the motivation or the capabilities, but Harry doubted whatever had happened to Mrs. Norris had been Draco's doing. He had been at the feast with the rest of them.

That thought triggered another memory in his mind. The memory of Weasley and Granger hurrying towards the hall just as the rest of them made their exit.

Harry's eyes swept the crowd and found them not far from the front. They must have made a mad dash for the stairs as soon as the sound of screaming had made its way down to the gathered crowd, or else they had already been among the students climbing when it had happened. They made sense as suspects, seeing as they hadn't been at the feast, but Harry couldn't see how anyone in the crowd could have done this and been seen coming from the floor below.

The two of them were staring at the wall with expressions much like the one Harry thought he must have been wearing. Their eyes were wide and full of confusion and their jaws were slack. Harry tried to meet their eyes, but he couldn't. They may have been the most likely culprits, but somehow he doubted it. He didn't know all that much about Granger or Weasley, but he didn't think either of them to be good enough actors to pull off a performance like that, especially in the face of the stress they would be feeling if the whole school really had just come about their crime scene. Weasley certainly hadn't seemed a master of his emotions during Neville Longbottom's funeral.

He glanced to his other side where Daphne and the rest of his friends were standing. Most of them looked every bit as confused as Harry felt, but Blaise and Daphne served as the exceptions. Blaise's face looked perfectly blank and Daphne's looked as though she had just solved some great puzzle. There was a light behind her eyes that clashed strangely with the obvious worry and apprehension etched upon every inch of her face.

"You'll be next, mudbloods!"

Harry's head whipped around the second he heard the call. He had recognized the voice at once, but part of him had hoped it wasn't Draco. It was. He --- or more likely Crabbe and Goyle --- had pushed to the front of the crowd. The look in the boy's eyes seemed almost deranged. The way the grey of his irises shimmered in the torchlight made them look like vengeful storm clouds.

Harry remembered what had happened the last time Draco had used that word. He had been so distracted by the chaos on the pitch that he had not considered how he had felt. He disliked the word. He was beginning to understand why many purebloods stood so strongly against those whom they considered to be blood traitors, but to condemn an entire demographic based on a small number choosing not to follow your ways, or whatever their reason was...

It also struck too close to home for him. He was a halfblood born to a muggleborn mother. He had never known her, nor did he feel all that attached to her, but it was still a consideration. He had spent a great many nights in his cupboard wishing for his parents to rescue him. Though they never had, the thought was there.

"What's going on here?"

The thick Scottish accent clearly belonged to McGonagall. She was among a procession of professors; Dumbledore led the way, but McGonagall trailed him alongside Snape, Flitwick, Sprout, and the headmaster's brother. Harry tried hard not to glare at Aberforth. The old bastard had not given him a reprieve. Harry had been hoping that if he refused to kill the lamb for long enough the codger would let him off, but he hadn't and Harry couldn't understand why the man was so needlessly cruel.

"My cat!" screeched Filch. "One of the little bastards killed my cat! I know they did! I'll kill them, whoever did it, I'll string them up by their bloody ankles and rip the head from their shoulders. Every single one of them!"

"I do hope that will not be necessary, Argus," said Dumbledore, striding purposefully towards the torch from which the cat's lifeless body hung.

The students parted before him and the other professors so he reached the cat in good time. He plucked her body delicately from the torch after running his wand over her lifeless form a number of times.

"She is not dead." Though Dumbledore spoke softly and in a hushed tone, every student heard the words. The crowd had fallen silent as soon as the old man had reached the torch bracket.

"But-but," stammered Filch.

"I assure you, Argus, your companion is very much alive. Come, we shall discuss in more detail, but we shall do so in private." He turned to the gathered crowd. "Everyone is to return to their common rooms. Curfew will be called to order in fifteen minutes' time. Chop chop!"

"It was Weasley," yelled Draco. "Weasley did it! Him and Granger! They weren't in the Great Hall at dinner!"

Harry's jaw tightened. Draco still had not yet prevailed over his obsession with Ron Weasley, it seemed. He'd hoped that perhaps Neville Longbottom's death might have made his former friend grow up a bit in that regard. Between the incident on the Quidditch pitch and his behaviour tonight, it was painfully clear that Harry had done so in vain.

Dumbledore fixed Weasley and Granger with his blue-eyed stare. Harry could see the way Granger tensed and how Weasley's eyes grew wide and frantic. A pink flush was creeping up his body, too, but he seemed to hide it well. If Harry hadn't known Draco to be incapable of such a feat, he might have truly thought the blond responsible for the hanging of the cat. It was almost as though he was trying to frame Weasley and Granger. It might have seemed like an attempted cover-up had Harry not been all too aware of the boy's spiteful grudges.

"Is this true?" Dumbledore asked the pair of them. "Were you at the feast tonight?"

"It is, Albus," said Professor McGonagall. "They were reported missing to me. I thought not to trouble you with it during the feast."

Dumbledore's face was impassive. "Master Weasley, Miss Granger, do join us, if you would be so kind." He glanced back at the crowd. "Off with the rest of you. A good night to all."

Ron fidgeted uncomfortably as he followed Dumbledore and the other professors. They seemed to be moving in the opposite direction as the rest of the school. Hermione was a mess beside him. She was shaking like a panicked dog in the middle of a thunderstorm; Ron vividly remembered the breakdown she'd had last May when the muggleborn had thought the two of them, plus Neville, were going to be expelled.

"May we use your office, Aberforth?" Dumbledore asked. "It is closest, I believe."

"If you must," the man grunted. Ron liked Aberforth a great deal. He was miles better than Quirrell had been. He had arrived at the school at an ideal time for Ron, too; just as he took an interest in Defence Against the Dark Arts.

Much as Ron liked Aberforth, he found his office to be unbearably dull. Malfoy might have mocked him for his place of residence, but the thing Ron had always liked about the Burrow was that it was never predictable. It was always interesting and the house was never dull, either in terms of the atmosphere or the aesthetic. His professor's office was almost completely void of any and all decor. Only two portraits ornamented the room, and the professor had stood in front of one and moved the other out of sight with his wand before Ron could get a clear view of it.

"They killed her!" Filch shrieked, pointing a gnarled finger towards Ron and Hermione. "You heard the boy in the corridor! They weren't at the feast, it must have been them, I want them punished, I want them hung, I want---"

"Argus, I must implore you to calm down or I will be forced to request you leave. Given the circumstances, I believe you deserve to be here for this meeting. Please do not force me to ensure you are not present." Filch snapped his mouth shut. Dumbledore laid Mrs. Norris down upon the desk and began examining her much more closely than he had in the hallway above. "It is as I said," Dumbledore turned his blue-eyed stare on Filch, "she is not dead, Argus."

"N-not dead?"

"It appears to me that Mrs. Norris has been petrified. By what, exactly, I'm afraid I cannot say." He looked to Snape, who had thus far not said so much as a word. "Would you care to have a look at her, Severus?"

Snape nodded curtly and stepped forward, drawing his wand like a sword as he did so. His long nose nearly touched the cat's fur as he ran his wand over her, muttering in strange and ancient tongues Ron would likely never know.

He was at it for a number of minutes before he straightened. "This is nothing I have seen or heard of before." His voice was as impassive as the calm sea. "She has been touched by no curse that I can identify and I am certain that no poison was involved. I do not know what else could have done it, Headmaster."

"Nor do I," Dumbledore admitted. Ron noticed that the professors cast odd glances at each other when that was said. Flitwick, McGonagall, and Sprout seemed to fidget, too. "It is a most perplexing case."

"Ask them!" Filch exploded, glaring at the Gryffindors with the intensity of Medusa. "It was them; it must have been!"

"No second year could have done this," Dumbledore said softly.

"Yet they are the only viable suspects we have." Snape's voice was smoother than silk and colder than the most biting of winds.

"You have examined her yourself, Severus. Surely you do not believe second years to be capable---"

"I have no doubt the fools never orchestrated the thing themselves. More likely, they carried out the instructions of another or acted indirectly. It may be that Weasley and Granger were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time," his lip curled in a way that made it clear how likely he thought that to be, "but they have been linked to a suspicious set of circumstances. If they are so innocent, I would ask why they were absent from the feast tonight?"

Hermione's mouth opened, but her tongue failed to form the words. She was frozen, just as she had been when the two of them and Neville had landed in the Devil's Snare.

Ron cleared his throat. "We... uh, we were at Nick's deathday party?"

"Who the hell's what now?" Aberforth asked gruffly.

"Uh... Nearly-Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost?"

"Oh, him. Yes, I know the one. Now, what in the seven hells is a deathday party?"

"The celebration of the day a ghost passed on," squeaked Professor Flitwick. "Most of them don't celebrate, but some do for special occasions."

"This was his six-hundredth," Hermione piped up in a small voice much higher than usual. Ron thought it a miracle she had found her voice at all.

"I am most jealous," said Snape, "I'm sure such an illustrious occasion must have been... exhilarating. It must really have made you feel... alive." His lip curled once more. "Yet, despite the majesties of such a gathering, I doubt ghosts serve food fit for the living. Tell me, why is it you did not return to the feast in time to ensure the two of you did not go to bed hungry?"

Ron looked at the floor and he could feel the heat of his blush as he muttered something about losing track of time.

"Typical," drawled Snape. "I suppose the ghosts neglected to splurge on a clock for the occasion?"

"I don't care about some stupid ghost party!" Filch had found his voice again and his face was flushed so red that Ron thought steam might billow from his ears at any moment. "I want to hear about my cat!"

"Oh, shut it, you old fool!" snapped Aberforth, turning to his brother. "Can we heal the damn cat so he can shut his mouth and get out of our sight?"

"I believe we can, but it will not be tonight. Mandrake Draught should be sufficient but ours are still maturing and they are extremely rare. I doubt finding any will be a viable option, let alone affording them."

"Our Mandrakes won't be ready to harvest for months," said Sprout. "May or June, I would guess."

Filch looked catatonic and couldn't so much as speak. "I will make inquiries," Dumbledore promised, though Ron could tell he was not optimistic. "If I do manage to acquire the appropriate potion, I will ensure your precious Mrs. Norris is restored to you at once."

"What of Weasley and Granger?" asked Snape. "Guilty or not, they should have been present at the feast or at least informed their Head of House. Need I remind you, Headmaster, that they would likely have been arrested for their part in the dragon fiasco last May had you not begged the Department of Magical Law Enforcement for their pardon?"

"Would you have seen children judged by the same sword as men?" Snape's expression gave nothing away. "They are children, and like all children, they must learn." Dumbledore turned to the both of them. "You will each serve a detention for your poor communication. Professor Snape is most correct. Leave from the feast should have been requested. At the very least, you should have made Professor McGonagall aware of your absence."

"You-you don't think we hurt Mrs. Norris?" Hermione's voice trembled, but she just barely managed to lift her head enough to meet Dumbledore's eyes.

His expression was pensive as he met Hermione's gaze. "No, Miss Granger, I do not. Bright as you may be, I think this is leagues above your current set of capabilities. The same goes for Master Weasley. I will make an announcement on the morrow clearing you both of any accusations so that the school might not give you such a hard time. I fear it may not completely subvert the undeserved blame, but it is the best I can offer. I apologize if this causes you any problems." He glanced at the clock on the wall. "Your house will doubtlessly be waiting. Minerva, do escort them and make the Gryffindors aware of their innocence."

"Of course, Albus," said McGonagall, leading the both of them from the room. Ron could only breathe a silent sigh of relief as soon as the door closed behind them.

***November 1, 1992***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***10:32 PM***

The night the writing had appeared on the wall had been a very tense one in Slytherin House. Harry had watched the way that many of the older students cast veiled glances around at one another and wondered what they all meant. He had contemplated seeking out Diana. Despite his divide with Draco, she had remained all too willing to answer his questions. He couldn't find her though, nor could he see her brother anywhere. He wondered if the two of them were off somewhere. Perhaps Diana was criticizing him for the mudblood comment. Many of the older Slytherins were mocking him for it in quiet whispers --- Daphne had done likewise. Harry couldn't disagree that it made him look extremely suspicious, but he still didn't think Draco was capable of such a feat.

Most in the house went to bed early that night, though Harry suspected many didn't fall asleep for quite some time. The next morning was a Saturday and curfew was lifted, leaving the students to go about their days as normal. Dumbledore absolved Weasley and Granger of any guilt at breakfast and announced a full sweep of the castle had been carried out. Nothing at all out of the ordinary had been found, and things would proceed as normal.

Harry spent much of the day in the library, though he did practice combat magic with Cassie as well. He couldn't wait for the day when their Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor might finally give up their detentions. He often went straight from lessons with Cassie to the detentions and Harry was just plain sick of them by now.

He let out all of his pent up frustration at Aberforth and the situation in one long, deep breath as he stepped from the man's office and began making his way down into the dungeons. Instead of heading to the common room, Harry stopped a bit short in a corridor full of serpentine decor not far from the room where Slytherin dwelled. He glanced quickly around to make sure no one was nearby before he leant into the wall and whispered a command that escaped from his mouth in a rasping hiss.

**"Open."**

The wall slid noiselessly aside, allowing him to step into the hidden passage before it closed just as silently behind him.

Since coming to the revelation at Malfoy Manor that speaking Parseltongue was a very unique gift, Harry's imagination had wandered. There were a plentiful number of snakes in the dungeons. Carvings, portraits, implements in the shape of them, and even the occasional living one dwelling in the cracks of the ancient stone walls and floors. His curiosity had been piqued when he'd thought back to the London Zoo. The boa constrictor had not just heard him, it had listened. He had wondered whether or not all these snakes would do the same. Thus far, the results had been very much to his satisfaction.

Some of the decor was indeed enchanted, it seemed, to hide hidden passages that only Parselmouths could access. Harry had found three so far, but he wondered whether or not there were more. All three of them had been found in the dead of night whilst he crept around under his invisibility cloak. He wouldn't be risking speaking to snakes in broad daylight. Not without a very good reason, at least. Between Slytherin himself and people like Voldemort long after him, the language had a dark and despised reputation in Magical Britain.

This passage was a shortcut that led much deeper into the dungeons. There were actually a couple of exits from the hidden tunnel he had not yet explored, but it ended in a wall that would slide open just like the entrance on the other side. It allowed the user to traverse a great distance of the dungeons in a very short amount of time. When Harry came out on the other side, he strode towards the nearest classroom and knocked twelve times.

Millicent opened the door almost at once and stepped aside, allowing Harry in. It was a simple abandoned classroom. A number of desks had been pulled back into the middle of the room from where they had been stacked along the walls to allow Daphne, Blaise, Tracey, and Lillian to sit, with spots open for Harry and Millicent.

"How was detention?" Tracey asked with a sly smirk. Harry hadn't told any of them what Aberforth had him do in those detentions, but they all knew how poor a mood they left him in.

"Like the rest of them," he spat, looking at Daphne. "What's up, Daphne? I usually just call it a night after these detentions. What had you so hung up on a meeting?"

"Last night." Harry grew curious at once. He remembered the look in her eyes when they had seen the writing. As though she had solved some great puzzle, but also full of wariness and apprehension.

"You know what it means?"

"I know what whoever wrote on the wall was getting at. They might be bluffing. It seems a bit too much to believe from someone still in school, but I suppose it's not impossible."

"You know what is impossible?" Tracey asked no one in particular. "Any of us knowing what you're on about unless you get to the point."

A smile played at the corner of Daphne's lips. "Patience is important, Tracey. You should learn it at some point." She turned to the rest of them. "Do you all remember what was written on the wall?"

"Hard not to," said Lillian. "I've heard the professors still haven't figured out how to remove it."

"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened," Harry quoted. "Enemies of the Heir, beware."

"Have you ever read *Hogwarts, A History*, Harry?" asked Daphne.

"Some of it," he answered. He had read a bit of it before his first year, and then some more of the book as the year went on. He had become altogether distracted by learning magic, however, so he had never finished it.

"How much do you know about the Hogwarts founders?"

He shrugged. "Not a lot. Slytherin was a Parselmouth and the first in Britain who could speak to snakes. Gryffindor was bold and used to duel wizards with wands and muggles with a sword for the fun of it. Hufflepuff was kind and I think she was the one who brought house elves to Hogwarts. Ravenclaw was brilliant and the rumour is that her tiara, or whatever it's called, makes the person who wears it smarter."

"Diadem, but yes," said Daphne, "that's basically all correct. There's a lot more, but only one bit is really relevant."

Harry looked around to see if anyone else knew what she was talking about. It was hard to tell, but he thought Bulstrode might have. The rest seemed as clueless as he felt.

"After a few years of working in peace," Daphne began, "Gryffindor and Slytherin started to argue. They argued over muggleborns; whether or not they should be allowed at Hogwarts. Gryffindor said everyone should have the chance to learn magic, and Slytherin said the risks were too high."

"The risks?" asked Harry.

"Muggle religion was on the rise in England," said Daphne. "The muggles were starting to do horrible things to the witches and wizards they found. Things I doubt any of us can imagine."

Harry shuddered involuntarily and hoped that none of them could spot it. He could see blood running over snow like a fast-flowing river filled to the brim with crimson water. He could see a frail body lying lifeless and somehow flat, and he could see the horrible ooze pouring from Wylla Nurmen's skull; like a thick and chunky soup. He could imagine what the muggles might do better than Daphne could ever hope to realize.

"Is this where the blood supremacy stuff comes from?"

Daphne exchanged looks with Millicent and Lillian. "It's... a big part of it, yes. Muggles didn't exactly treat wizards well. We were stoned, burnt alive, hung, tortured, and all kinds of things for centuries. The Statute of Secrecy put a stop to it, but before that, it wasn't easy for witches and wizards to walk around freely without a muggle trying to persecute them. It's not the only reason blood supremacy exists, but it's definitely a part of it."

Harry managed to suppress the shudder this time. The words rang true with him. All he had been through and all Grindelwald had been through spoke the same horrible truth. Even Voldemort's monologue in the third-floor corridor lined up. He had spoken passionately about muggles and their inherent need to destroy anything they failed to understand.

"We're off-topic, though," Daphne continued. "Eventually, the argument between Gryffindor and Slytherin got so bad that Salazar left the school." She paused. "That's where it gets interesting. That much is known fact, but rumours have been floating around for centuries about Slytherin. All kinds of them, actually, but one of them claims he left a monster somewhere in a hidden chamber at Hogwarts. Some people say only his true heir can find the chamber and unleash the monster. Most seem to think, if it exists, that Salazar hoped his heir would find it and use it to kill all of the school's muggleborns. I find that part to be ridiculous, but the monster isn't totally out of the question."

"It's... not?" asked Harry. "Isn't that a little... far-fetched?"

"Slytherin was paranoid," said Lillian. "We don't know much about him, but we know that. Also spiteful... he didn't like losing."

"There's a reason one of Slytherin's key traits is ambition," Daphne said with a smile that stretched to her eyes.

"But... surely it would have been found by now, right?"

"Who knows?" asked Millicent. "Maybe only Slytherin's family can get into it. Maybe you need to prove you're related. There are doors and stuff that won't happen without blood."

"Blood magic, yes," said Daphne. "One of the most complicated and powerful branches of magic that exist. It is extremely illegal, but it wasn't at that time."

Blaise snorted. "I'm sure Salazar kept a pamphlet of all the laws of the world beside his bed at all times. It was his easy reading material before bed, I would wager."

Daphne was trying and failing to look annoyed at the interruption. She was laughing just like the rest of them. "The point is, there are ways it could have been done. That's what whoever wrote on the wall meant by the Chamber of Secrets. Enemies of the Heir must mean the muggleborns --- and maybe the blood traitors, too."

That was an interesting point, Harry realized. He had no idea as to Daphne's stance on blood supremacy or traditionalism. Her family was one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight and a Founding House to boot. That and her casual usage of the term blood traitor made him think she was at least a traditionalist. On the other hand, Davis was not a noble family --- though Tracey had said she was a pureblood --- and Harry himself was only a halfblood. If she did prescribe to the blood supremacist agenda, she was definitely one of the cause's more reasonable and less radical patrons.

Harry found himself extremely curious. He thought about the ways Parseltongue caused some of the snake carvings and the like to obey him. What if that was the way to find the Chamber of Secrets? What if one of those doors in the passage he had used to speed up the trek here led right into it? Or what if it was just hidden behind another passage he had yet to find?

He was almost curious enough to go looking, but two things stopped him.

The last time he had recklessly given into his curiosity had been the night after his final exam last year. The night he had waited for Weasley, Granger, and Longbottom to return from their trek down the third-floor corridor. That had been the night he had come face-to-face with the Dark Lord, and it was the night that Neville Longbottom had died because of his actions. He had promised himself he would be more careful after that, and even more so after he had been portkeyed straight into Nurmengard.

There was another thing, too.

*"There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year. Dobby has known it for months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is too important, sir!"*

The elf's warning rang through his hair like the clattering of bells as he frowned deeply.

Had Dobby known about the Chamber of Secrets? It seemed impossible, but it made sense. A petrification that not even Dumbledore could explain certainly fit the bill. Dobby had even said that there were powers even Dumbledore didn't possess.

That was enough to discourage Harry. If Dobby had known the right of it, even back on the first of September, then he likely knew more. If he thought Harry shouldn't put himself in harm's way, Harry was inclined to listen --- especially after the incidents that capped off his first year at Hogwarts.

Though all of this did raise an interesting question and a worrying possibility.

How had Dobby known about the Chamber of Secrets and did this mean Draco really could be responsible for the whole thing? Had his loud proclamation been a frame job after all? Harry couldn't see how the boy might have acted whilst feasting in the Great hall, but there were many things he didn't know. Perhaps he could have summoned Dobby and had him do it. Or paid an older student --- the Malfoys had no shortage of disposable gold. It fit with his vicious mood, too; a mood that had only worsened since Harry's split from him and his group.

Harry shivered as he remembered Daphne's words about how the Malfoys had used him as a tool. He remembered all the suspicious things that pointed to the fact she may well have been right and suddenly, Harry wondered exactly what he may or may not have gotten himself into. Merlin, this was all so confusing. He hated every bit of it.

***November 7, 1992***

***The Slytherin Changing Room***

***8:56 AM***

Waves of noise seemed to crash against the changing room's outer walls like water slamming against a rocky shore. It reminded Harry of the night Hagrid had found him and the storm that had raged outside all the while.

The walls suppressed the noise enough that none inside could hear anything that was being said. Or perhaps that had less to do with the walls and more to do with the fact that there were just so many voices. It was a constant, indiscernible drone that the walls barely quieted.

Harry was grateful for that at least. It was to be his first-ever Quidditch match and he could not remember a time he had felt so sick. The day he had sat atop a spindle-legged stool and been sorted into Slytherin House was the closest comparison that he could come up with offhandedly. There was just so much riding on this game.

Tensions had been at an all-time high within the castle; it was like the very halls were at war. One wearing either green or silver robes never knew what might await them around each and every corner. Harry was told that the week or so leading up to any Quidditch match between the two rival houses was wrought with tension and conflict, but the horrors of Samhain had added another depth to this particular clash.

The school was in a state of disarray and Harry had never seen the houses so divided. Almost the whole of Slytherin House had been loudly parading around the castle preaching to anyone who would listen that it had been the blood traitor Weasley and the mudblood Granger who had petrified Filch's cat. They had not been at the feast, Slytherins would say, and the two of them had valid reasons to detest the house of the snake. Especially considering the way Draco had gotten them into such trouble last May and the incident on the Quidditch pitch earlier that year. If you asked any Slytherin worth their green and silver robes, they would tell you that it was a poorly attempted frame job in the hopes of tarnishing Slytherin's reputation or maybe even getting one of its members falsely expelled.

The Gryffindors saw things quite differently. They all seemed to universally defend Weasley and Granger. Weasley was scarcely seen without some sort of honour guard nowadays. It appeared that Oliver Wood had put many of the older students up to following the red-headed second year like preying vultures.

Yet the Gryffindors went beyond simply protecting their own. They seemed to have taken Slytherin's accusations as an open challenge. More duels had broken out that week in the halls than Harry could count. The Weasley twins had been especially vicious. Their various antics had left no less than eight Slytherins in the hospital wing. Of course, no one had proven they had been involved in any of them thus far, but Harry thought it was glaringly obvious to anyone with a working brain and a set of eyes.

Flint had seen the way Weasley was guarded so carefully and mimicked the gesture with the younger players of the Slytherin team. This had led to a number of very awkward walks to classes and the like during which Harry and Draco had stood scant metres apart. Neither of them had said a word on any of these occasions, but Harry felt as though he was suffocating each and every time.

The Hufflepuffs and the Ravenclaws were as divided as ever, but neither house seemed to want anything to do with the mess. Harry couldn't blame them. He wanted nothing to do with it himself. He hoped the match was going to be fun, but it surely wouldn't be worth needing to glance over his shoulder at all hours of the day.

The bitter rivalry had elevated this particular match's importance. As the seeker, Harry knew that better than anyone. He had lost count of the number of Slytherins who had approached him over the week. Most of them had told him, in one way or another, that he had better win the match. Some of them were much kinder about it than others --- some went as far as to make outright threats.

Not only would losing the match give Gryffindor an edge in the ruthless back and forth their houses were locked in, but Harry feared it may put him right back into a compromising position. He had enjoyed his peace ever since falling in with Daphne and her group of friends, except for the morning when someone had decided to send him an envelope full of bubotuber pus. Daphne still vowed that she would find the culprit, for she was sure it had been a Hogwarts student. Unfortunately, she had been unsuccessful.

Her presence in particular offered him a certain degree of protection against the bigots in the upper years. He hoped that through his gruelling nights practicing with Cassie, he would be able to defend himself from any upper year in the school before too long, but he wasn't unrealistic in his expectations. Harry hoped that day would come soon, but he knew its arrival was still a long time away. Worse was the worry that Daphne's presence would not be enough to dissuade the upper years if Harry allowed Ron Weasley to beat him to the snitch.

And if all of that had not been enough, Snape had apparently seen fit to add to his stress the day before.

***The previous day, in the Potions Classroom...***

The class had been a complete and total disaster. Many in the dungeon were still choking. Horrid purple smoke had flowed through the room fast as a swiftly blowing wind not seconds earlier, but Snape had vanished it soon after it had appeared. Harry had seen how it had happened and was only grateful it had not been him on the receiving end of Weasley's sabotage. The boy had thrown... something into Draco's cauldron. There had been an explosion that had caused a violent reaction that melted the cauldron into a twisted glob of molten pewter on the floor while the toxic-smelling fumes wafted into the air like columns of billowing steam.

Harry had been glaring at Weasley in the beginning, but something nagged at him. He felt... something. A gentle nudge at the corners of his mind. It was not unlike how Dumbledore had described a Legilimency attack. Not that Harry would know for himself. He was not yet adept enough for Dumbledore to truly test him with those attacks, but the time would come soon enough.

He turned his head to the right on instinct alone and saw it. The hem of robes disappearing as their owner stepped into Snape's office. His eyes narrowed as he carefully watched the door until Hermione Granger stepped out a few minutes later, unnoticed by most of the class.

"What is she up to?" Daphne muttered from beside him. Whether she had spotted Granger herself or simply noticed where her partner had been looking, Harry did not know.

"No idea," he answered. "It was definitely set up, though."

Daphne looked at him as though he were a slow child. "I'm not Crabbe or Goyle," she told him. "You don't need to lay out things to me that are as obvious as the sun rising in the east and setting in the west."

Harry fought against the flush that rose to his cheeks as Snape finished vanishing whatever Weasley had sent up into the air from Draco's cauldron. Harry and Daphne were about as far as they could get from Draco whilst still remaining on the Slytherin's side of the classroom, so they were mostly unaffected.

"Potter!" Snape called minutes later and right before the class was set to end. "Stay behind!"

Harry almost sighed aloud. Snape had been far from pleasant last year. He had showered every Slytherin not named Harry Potter with points every time they so much as breathed, it seemed, yet Harry had not been awarded a point all year. It was true that Potions was not his best subject, but he had always been adequate. He had brewed many potions better than others who were awarded points for their efforts, but Snape had ignored him each and every time. After that first day, that seemed to have been his policy regarding Harry in general. It was better than outright torment, but it had left a bitter taste in the then first year's mouth.

This year, things had only become worse. Snape seemed to have developed a vendetta against Harry over the summer. He could not imagine why. He didn't know why Snape had disliked him in the first place, but this was a whole different thing altogether. And why? He had never done anything to anger Snape. He had done his best to keep his head down around the man, if anything, and his reward had been venomous glares, poisoned words, and a partnership with a boy who had been meant to be his undoing before Daphne had basically rescued him from that predicament.

Harry felt apprehension rise within him once the bell rang and the room began to thin. It was the first time he had been alone with Snape since the Potion Master's sudden change of heart towards him.

"You asked me to stay behind, sir?"

Snape looked up from the vial he was studying and sneered at him. "Do not ask me questions you already know the answer to, Potter. You may be plagued by a countless number of personal flaws, but you are no half-wit and I believe your hearing is perfectly adequate."

Harry ground his teeth together. "Yes, sir."

Snape studied him. "How do you feel, Potter?"

Harry startled at the question, nearly losing the grip he had on his school bag. "Sir?"

"I said, how do you feel, Potter?"

"I'm... all right, sir."

"Tomorrow, you will need to be more than all right. I will not have you embarrassing Slytherin House out on the Quidditch pitch." His expression darkened. "Your father was a pathetic braggart with a head bigger than Hagrid, but Quidditch was the one area in which James Potter lived up to his boasting. I expect you to be every bit as magnificent tomorrow as he ever was." Their eyes met. "I will be... most displeased if you do not live up to my expectations."

Harry resisted the urge to gulp. "I understand, sir."

"Dismissed," said the Potions Master, waving his hand and returning to the vial he had been studying before Harry had drawn his attention.

***Back in the present...***

All of it was a weight on his shoulders so heavy that Harry felt like his knees would buckle the second he rose to his feet. Most around him looked every bit as anxious as he was. Draco had not raised his stare from the floor since he had entered the room. He was running a hand up and down his Nimbus 2001 in a way that was almost rhythmic. Cassius's foot was tapping faster and faster on the changing room's floor as the game drew closer and his eyes were fixed upon the wall in front of him. Derrick and Bole were both stretching, but as they did, Harry noticed a great deal of tension within them. Flint was stone-faced but resolute, and Miles Bletchley was pacing about the room like a caged animal itching to be loosed.

The oppressive tension hanging in the air like precipitation was such that Harry could hardly believe it had not blasted the changing room's door from its hinges yet. Surely this room could not contain all of it.

And then, they heard it.

"WELCOME, EVERYONE, TO THE OPENING MATCH OF THE 1992--1993 HOGWARTS QUIDDITCH SEASON BETWEEN GRYFFINDOR AND SLYTHERIN!"

Lee Jordan's magically amplified voice was muffled by the walls, like the rest of the noise, but they had no trouble making out every word. The unanimous roar of approval from the crowd penetrated the room just as effectively and Harry could feel his heart begin to quicken. It was as though his heart was but a drum and the cry of the audience had been the cue for the drummer to begin playing a song that required an unreasonably fast cadence as he beat upon the instrument.

"Everybody up." Flint's voice was as unyielding as iron. He might not have been one for pre-match speeches, but when Marcus Flint spoke, people listened.

The team took to their feet and arranged themselves in a single-file line facing the changing room's exit, which Flint opened with a wave of his wand. Jordan was introducing the Gryffindor team. Harry saw the looks of twisted bitterness and poorly masked fury on many of his teammates' faces when the lions were introduced as the defending champions. Last year had been the first in more than half a decade in which Slytherin had not captured the Quidditch cup.

The lions' team was unchanged from the previous year. Their captain would still man the goals, the Weasley twins were still the most terrifying pair of beaters Hogwarts had seen in years, Johnson, Bell, and Spinnet were presumably still the well-oiled machine Harry had remembered, and Ron Weasley was still the boy who had been the youngest seeker in a century. It was going to take a Herculean effort to take down the Gryffindors --- Nimbus 2001s or not.

"AND NOW," called Lee Jordan, "I PRESENT TO YOU THE SLYTHERIN QUIDDITCH TEAM! BLETCHLEY, BOLE, DERRICK, MALFOY, WARRINGTON, FLINT, AND POTTER!"

The wind slammed into Harry with enough force to snap his head back as he soared out the changing room. The feeling of acceleration on a broomstick was among his favourite sensations in the world. There was a moment when his stomach seemed to fall from his body and his heart leaped up to his throat. It was one of the things Harry enjoyed the most and he no longer found himself nervous about the game to come.

The teams were lined up at centrefield in short order. Harry watched as Wood and Flint seemed to try and break the other's hand. He never understood why captains bothered exerting the energy for such things. If one of them ever actually managed the feat, Harry thought he may reconsider his stance.

The whistle's blast cut through the morning air like a sharp-edged sword. Harry rocketed skywards once more and immediately realized he had the advantage over Weasley --- who had been glaring at him as though Harry had done something personally offensive to his mother or some nonsense. He and Weasley didn't even particularly dislike each other; best as Harry could tell, the boy was just a Gryffindor who had the house's typical competitive streak.

His broom rose faster than Weasley's, but he had to dodge a bludger almost immediately. The dodge wasn't difficult, but it did divert his path. Harry was grateful for it. Being struck by a bludger at high speeds had been one of the things Harry had been most worried about when he had begun to properly practice Quidditch. To have the first dodge out of the way so early was nice; he knew that he could avoid them now.

He heard something whistling through the air towards him and rolled on instinct alone. The same bludger sped past him. Harry saw it invert in the air this time before rocketing back towards him. His eyes widened. What in Merlin's name was going on?

He dodged once more and flew towards his beaters at top speed. Derrick and Bole had seen him by now and knew what he was doing. Harry flew straight past them, leading the bludger into a well-placed strike with the bat. Harry sighed, happy to finally have a break.

"What in the hell?" he heard Derrick shout and all of a sudden, he was dodging again.

"Somebody's fucked with the bludger!" called Bole.

Harry knew at once that it was true. Bludgers weren't supposed to focus on any one player. They were not supposed to hone in on a target, but try and unseat any player within striking range. Harry was not the most well-read player on the pitch in regards to Quidditch, but he had never heard of anything like this happening. He wondered whether or not it might be some sort of plot by one of the upper years. Perhaps it was even the same student who had sent him the bubotuber pus. He had no idea how hard it was to enchant something like a bludger. He imagined it was a bit above fourth-year level magic or he might have suspected the Weasley twins. Something so outlandish and ill-thought would have perfectly matched the tone of all their other antics during the past week or so since Mrs. Norris had turned up petrified.

Harry jerked his broom up and shot skywards. He flew high above the pitch, dodging the bludger at each and every turn as he scanned for any sign of the elusive golden snitch. He was a good flyer, he knew, but he was beginning to see how this game would play out. The bludger would follow him at all costs and eventually, he would tire. Fatigue tended to lead to mistakes, and Harry could not afford to make one.

Derrick and Bole were both pursuing the bludger and doing their best to keep it away from Harry, but they were only partially successful. They did manage to knock it away for a moment, which gave Harry time to scan the pitch. It was a bright and cloudless morning. The sun shone down and caused the dew far below to sparkle on the grass like liquid diamonds. It reflected the sunlight in all sorts of ways that would make finding the snitch an absolute bitch if it was too close to the ground. Harry would have to hope it flew high, especially because Weasley seemed to be playing as something like a fourth chaser. The Gryffindors probably suspected his chances of catching the snitch with his beaters and the bludger impeding his path to be slim at best. Why not run up the score before their own seeker made the easiest catch of his life? It made too much sense --- enough that Harry signalled to Flint at the first available opportunity. The captain mercifully heeded his plea and called for a time out.

Harry had been the highest in the sky and had to avoid the bludger on his way down, so he was the last to land. The thing tried to behead him even when Harry stepped off of his broom, but Bole tackled it out of the air. He was grunting and Harry could hear him scrambling every few seconds as he tried his best to pin the bludger down.

They were drawing attention from the crowd now. Those who had not yet realized the bludger seemed to be in a murderous rage were seeing it now.

Flint seemed unphased. "What is it, Potter?"

"The bludger is trying to kill me."

"Make it work," said Flint. "I won't have us losing this match. Not when we have better brooms and not with everything that's at stake. If we lose this after all that's happened, it's going to be a nightmare."

Harry didn't know why the words stung so fiercely. It was like Flint had slapped him across the face on the coldest day of winter. He should not have been surprised. Marcus Flint was not known for his kindness, especially to those born of anything less than the purest of unions.

"If you want me to win the damn match, tell Derrick and Bole to leave me alone. I'm wasting my time trying to catch the snitch if they just keep getting in the way."

"Don't be an idiot," snapped Cassius, "that thing will kill you."

"Not if I can catch the stupid snitch quickly."

"With a bludger chasing you the whole game?"

Harry stuck up his chin in his best imitation of Draco. The blond watched him interact with the rest quietly. His expression gave nothing away and he made no move to speak.

"You're the one who told me I would be good enough to make the team," Harry reminded Cassius. "I'm either good enough, or I'm not."

"Or you can just stop this madness!"

"Are you suggesting we forfeit, Warrington?" Flint's eyes sparkled with something deadly as he stared down Cassius.

Harry's older friend did not so much as flinch. "Look, I like Harry more than anyone on this team. If he manages to prove me wrong, all the more power to him, but I don't see how he can catch the snitch with the bludger trying to kill him. That just lets Weasley play chaser and our brooms don't make up for being a man down. We're already down by thirty, Flint, and we both know it's going to get worse if something doesn't change fast. Better to give it up now and keep all of our players alive."

"Where's your ambition, Warrington?"

Cassius ground his teeth together. "You want to lecture me about Slytherin traits, Flint? Use that brain of yours and stop acting like a Gryffindor. There's more to being in Slytherin and living life than not losing. It's called a tactical retreat for a reason."

"No!" Both boys looked sharply at Harry; Cassius looked as though he might burst with frustration at any moment. "I'm not forfeiting." He worried what would happen in Slytherin if he lost the match. He did not want to imagine what might become of him and his status if they *forfeited* because of *him*. That would be an entirely different level of vitriol; one he wasn't sure he was equipped to deal with. "Call off Derrick and Bole," he told Flint. "At least let me try and win this."

"And don't worry about Weasley." It was Draco who had spoken. Harry looked at him properly for the first time that day. He recognized that look in his former friend's eyes; it was the same look he had worn before goading Weasley into the midnight duel and the same look he had worn the morning after Hagrid had been caught smuggling the dragon. "I have a plan for him."

"Gentlemen!" Madam Hooch's voice brought them all back to the present. "Are you all ready to resume?"

"We are," said Flint before Cassius could get in another word. He cast glances towards both Derrick and Bole. "Leave Potter alone. Deal with the chasers and Weasley the best you can."

Cassius was seething by the time they took to the air again. Harry wondered what his friends thought of what was going on from their view in the stands but he had no time to consider the matter --- the bludger was on him again.

Harry evaded once, twice, three times as he shot skywards. He wondered if this was how the birds near the Black Lake felt in the warmer months of the year when students pelted them with any number of things to make them go away.

It was more exhausting now than it had been before. Flying a broom may not have taken great deals of energy, but the constant leaning from one side to the other while maintaining his grip was beginning to wear on Harry. His fingers were growing sore from how hard he had been clutching the broom not to fall off and his back was beginning to stiffen. Probably from throwing his body from one side to the other so recklessly and so often.

Weasley dove back down towards the cluster of chasers below, clearly intent on rejoining the play. Harry saw Draco waving at the crowd while he passed the quaffle to Cassius. Harry seethed for a moment. He could not imagine why Draco was gloating while Slytherin was trailing the lions, but he didn't have much time to dwell on his annoyance; the bludger was coming again.

A din of noise began to rise from the crowd as he evaded another attempt at his life. The sound wafted up into the air, but it didn't quite reach Harry, so far he was above the stands. He debated diving down, but the bludger was coming in again and the chant was rising. It must have been started by a smaller contingent and picked up by others, for soon, Harry could hear every word of it without fail.

"Weasley cannot catch the snitch

He flies all round and round the pitch

As good a seeker as he's rich,

Weasley is our favourite witch!

Weasley was born in a bin,

He doesn't let the riff-raff in,

Weasley will make sure we win,

Weasley is our King!

Weasley is our King!

Weasley is our King!

He doesn't let the riff-raff in,

Weasley is our King!"

His jaw nearly fell agape.

The first few choruses of the song were sung mostly by the younger Slytherins. First, second, and third years screamed every syllable as though they were using their dying breath, but many of the upper years clearly hadn't heard it yet. After a certain number of rounds, however, each and every single member of Slytherin House seemed to be screaming the words for all to hear.

"Weasley cannot catch the snitch

He flies all round and round the pitch

As good a seeker as he's rich,

Weasley is our favourite witch!

Weasley was born in a bin,

He doesn't let the riff-raff in,

Weasley will make sure we win,

Weasley is our King!

Weasley is our King!

Weasley is our King!

He doesn't let the riff-raff in,

Weasley is our King!"

This was Draco's work, Harry knew. The bit about Weasley being born in a bin was straight from the youngest Malfoy's playbook and the line about being a witch was much too juvenile to have been devised by an upper year.

But there was some cunning hidden behind the childish jabs.

He doesn't let the riff-raff in...

It was brilliant, in its own way. Many at the school thought Weasley the culprit from Samhain and it bothered both him and his house immensely. Anybody who knew the story of the Chamber of Secrets would know exactly what was being implied.

It was clear that Weasley knew, for the quaffle flew amiss when he tried to pass to Katie Bell. Seekers could handle the quaffle without issue; most of them just chose not to because of the risks. Seeing as Harry had spent the better part of the match trying not to die, he could hardly blame Weasley for thinking it an opportune game to play as offensively as he wished.

Weasley tried to intercept a pass from Draco to Flint, but he hadn't been watching Angelina Johnson try to do the same thing. The two of them collided hard. Harry could see a thin trickle of blood flowing from Weasley's nose as he disentangled himself from his chaser. The blood seemed to paint a line of crimson in the air as it flowed towards the ground below. Weasley had seen it, too. He froze at the sight of it, and that was when Harry saw the sparkle of gold.

It was closer to Weasley than it was to him, but he could not afford to wait. He had been moving through the air as though he was performing some sort of choreographed dance on his broomstick. It had been the only way to avoid the bludger and fatigue was well and truly setting in now. He needed to catch the snitch or he would not be staying on his broom for long.

He dove, adding a line of green and silver to the world's morning canvas as he shot towards the ground like an emerald arrow with a black tip where his hair fanned out in the wind. Weasley only saw him diving when the distance between Harry and the snitch had closed. Harry saw out of the corner of his eye Weasley wheel his broom about and fly towards the snitch. It was going to be close; Weasley was closer but Harry had the faster broom. He was closing fast, but not fast enough. Weasley was going to get it, he was about to reach for it, the match would be over at any moment...

"Weasley cannot catch the snitch

He flies all round and round the pitch

As good a seeker as he's rich,

Weasley is our favourite witch!

Weasley was born in a bin,

He doesn't let the riff-raff in,

Weasley will make sure we win,

Weasley is our King!

Weasley is our King!

Weasley is our King!

He doesn't let the riff-raff in,

Weasley is our King!"

The snitch floated through Weasley's fumbling fingers and Harry leant so far forward on his broom, he feared he might fall.

His fears proved themselves well founded.

The bludger slammed into his shoulder from behind. Harry heard the crunch of bone giving way against the flying ball's concussive force and he felt weightless as he fell, but there had been another sensation just seconds before. The feeling of metal against his palm and the rush of victory as his fingers had snatched the snitch from right under Weasley's nose as he fumbled aimlessly, desperately trying to remedy the mistake that would cost him his first-ever loss out on the Quidditch pitch.

Harry hit the ground so hard that he felt other things give way. His ribs seemed to ripple beneath his skin as though they weren't held in place and his lungs contracted as air was torn ruthlessly from his body. Everything ached as black spots danced before his eyes. The last thought Harry had before falling to unconsciousness was that he wasn't sure which bothered him more --- the searing pain in his ribs, shoulder, arm, and chest, or the mousy-haired boy running forward and taking pictures so fast that Harry thought the camera might explode.

***That night, in the hospital wing...***

All was dark when Harry next woke. He cast his eyes around the room, but he wore no glasses. They had been removed at some point whilst he was sleeping. His whole body did not just ache, but it burned and the skin itched. He reached over to scratch his arm, but he recoiled his hand at once. The bones under his skin felt... wrong. It was not a solid mass, but separate and disjointed pieces that moved under his skin at the barest touch. His mind flashed back to the bits of bone floating inside the soup-like substance contained within Wylla Nurmen's skull after the stoning and he very nearly vomited.

Fortunately he didn't, for footsteps could be heard within seconds of his waking. He thought at first that it must be Madam Pomfrey coming to check on him. He fumbled quietly for his glasses and found them before the footsteps drew too near. Jamming them onto his face, he rolled over so he could act as though he was sleeping, but his eyes were open just enough to see what was going on.

Even in the dark, there was no mistaking Dumbledore's silvery beard. It shone nearly as brightly as the castle ghosts and there was a certain air about the Headmaster that was just impossible to ignore. It was hard to see whilst squinting, but Harry thought the figure who followed him into the room was Professor McGonagall.

Then, he saw the other body. It was floating in the air as if it was on an invisible stretcher. Harry had to try hard not to gasp --- he could not tell whether the motionless figure was alive or dead.

"Get Madam Pomfrey," Dumbledore whispered and the other made off towards the matron's office.

The body had been levitated onto one of the other beds by the time McGonagall and Pomfrey returned. "Dear Merlin," breathed the matron, "what happened?"

"We think he was sneaking up to see Potter," said McGonagall, holding up a small basket of sweets. "These were beside him and he was seen trying to follow Potter up to the hospital wing. The boy was unconscious, but still he wanted to take his pictures and say his words."

"Let us not forget about this." Dumbledore spoke softly as he held up Colin Creevey's camera, but Harry could hear the note of tension in the old man's voice. He opened the camera but almost immediately dropped it. A thick cloud of billowing smoke rose from it. It filled the room and seemed to thicken the very air. Breathing was altogether more difficult for a moment before the smoke had been dispersed.

"Merlin's beard," said McGonagall, her voice nearly impossible to hear. "It's... melted." Harry could not see from his vantage point, but he could only assume she was talking about the film. "Albus... what does this mean?"

Dumbledore did not answer for a moment. Harry thought he could feel the Headmaster's eyes on him, but he was now looking in the other direction and very much hoped he was imagining it.

"It means," said Dumbledore, "that the Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened once again."

Harry found sleep did not come easily after that revelation. Much of the school had outright dismissed the possibility of the Chamber of Secrets actually being open once more, but Harry felt more inclined to believe Dumbledore than any of them. It made him uneasy to think that it could well be one of his housemates. The type to do such things seemed exactly like those who had been trying to make his life a living hell before he had befriended Daphne. For all he knew, whatever the boy's name had been had only been petrified on the way to the hospital because the Heir of Slytherin had sent the monster after Harry and the young, mousy-haired Gryffindor had gotten in the way.

It took some time before he was anywhere near ready to sleep. He had drifted in and out of the strange place between waking and sleeping since the professors had left the hospital wing. The sound of shuffling near his bed jolted him to alertness and he took special care to not move a muscle and give away his wakeful state. He listened for a minute before deciding to gather more information.

He slowly rolled over and opened his eyes. This time, his visitor did not fail to notice. A loud squeak pierced the air and the sound of running feet echoed through the hospital wing before a resounding *CRACK* took its place and all was silent.

Harry heard the matron stir in her office and rolled over once more, hoping for sleep and safety, but he was much less unaware than she would be once she reached him. He had seen the ears flap as the creature ran from the room, he had seen the battered pillowcase it wore, and he had seen its large, tennis-ball like eyes that were familiar to him.

After all, this was not the first time the Malfoys' elf had visited him before the sun had risen.

**Author's Endnote:**

**The pace of this story is going to pick up now that most of the pieces are on the board. The start of each school year can be quite cumbersome, but I am ready to begin speeding through the timeline a little bit. I did promise years with reasonable word counts, after all. This will be longer than CoS, quite obviously, but I do promise you all it won't border on anything like OotP.**

**Also, apologies for the excess of Quidditch for those who are not fans. It won't come up much, but this match was important. Also, regarding Ron, I think this should put some of your guys' fears at ease. He is not a different person in this story; he is just different because Harry isn't around him at all hours of the day. He can still crack under pressure and all the rest; the only reason he hadn't yet in Quidditch is because an eleven or twelve-year-old doesn't tend to overthink things the same way a fifteen or sixteen-year-old does.**

**Anyway, I hope you all enjoyed it.**

***March 29, 1893***

***Kirchdorf, Upper Bavaria, Germany***

***9:22 PM***

The fire crackled merrily in the corner of a small, dark room. Its warmth flowed through the space and had a calming sort of air about it. Gellert was huddled under his blanket, enjoying its warmth along with the fire. It was an unusually cold March, though the snow was finally beginning to melt. The fire and blankets offered him some reprieve from the biting chill. His father often coated the house in Warming Charms, but they only helped so much against the bitter winds that sought to slice across one's skin like a freezing razor.

Gellert had just come inside with his father. He had spent most of the day reading, but the two of them had enjoyed their time in the snow whilst they still could. It was why Gellert was so grateful for the stifling heat of the room and it was why he still shivered against his blanket.

His father, Johan, sat in a chair near his bed. The man seemed to have aged a decade in the years since he and his son had fled what was supposed to have been the site of Gellert's execution.

Gellert could understand why his father looked the way he did --- it had been a long four years. Gellert remembered nothing for several hours after the near-death experience at the church. He had fainted whilst his father apparated him away, but he had woken up in a small hut somewhere he hadn't known. Johan had taken a few of his most prized possessions from their old family home, but not many. One of which was the chair he now sat in; which he had shrunk down and later enlarged for easy carrying.

That first night had been a whirlwind. Johan had explained everything to Gellert. He had explained how he himself was a wizard capable of performing feats of magic Gellert would never have been able to dream of. He told of how Gellert also had the ability to wield magic; it had even been why the muggles had tried to execute him.

None of that had been the most painful part. The part which had torn at him was the knowledge that it had been his mother who had sold the secret to the church. She had been willing to watch him die just because he could do things she would never be capable of doing. The thought had made him sick. Bile used to rise in his throat at the very memory, conjoining sickeningly with the stabs of pain he had often felt in his chest, as if his heart was being pierced by a hundred sharpened daggers.

That pain had lessened over time and now, the memory of his mother meant almost nothing to him. She was just one of many muggles who had tried to wrong him because of their jealousy and their spite. He had been no different than Wylla Nurmen and hundreds or thousands of other unnamed victims. This was the only fact that still bothered him.

All of his personal demons had been long since executed, but the idea of the muggles treating wizards like vile criminals... it was one of the only things that made him angry every time he thought of it. It was like his stomach acid heated up and morphed into scalding lava at the very thought. The flush of heat and anger even rose up his body and tinged his face with its mark.

He had promised himself then that he would never trust a muggle again. Not after they had betrayed him and so many others so utterly. He hated all of them and had not so much as spoken to one since that day out of anything other than obligation. He and his father lived on the outskirts of a small German settlement nestled in the centre of vast flatlands carpeted in a thick expanse of trees. It was a muggle settlement. It was unfortunate, but his father said that Germany just didn't have the type of wizarding population needed to support entirely wizarding settlements. Gellert wished that was not the case; he wished for it above most other things.

He had spoken to several wizards over the years who were not his father. There were a few of them who lived not too far away from them and there had been the men who had come the day after his father had rescued him. They had been representatives of the German Ministry of Magic coming to inform his father that he had violated the International Statute of Secrecy. Gellert had been as worried for his father as he had been for himself whilst standing atop the pyre, but the following trial had passed with little drama. It had been unanimously agreed that Johan's use of magic was in defence of himself and his son and it had been deemed an exceptional circumstance. Gellert certainly thought that was one way of summarizing a horde of muggles trying to burn an innocent child alive.

The two of them had settled down after the trial. His father did random jobs here and there to financially support both of them. Gellert suspected that magic had done most of it, or that he used magic to supplement what it was they had at their disposal. The home they lived in was small, but comfortable and well-furnished. There was a fireplace in each of their bedrooms and one in the living room, though the walls were a touch drafty and the house could grow cold when assaulted by the chill of winter.

It had been the best four years of Gellert's life. He had wanted to learn everything he could about magic. His father was not a rich man who owned many books, nor was he a brilliant sorcerer who could tutor him in all branches of the overarching art of magic itself. Johan was patient and committed though, and those things counted for something. Gellert had been to see Mr. Gregorovich and get his wand at the age of eight. He hadn't been able to perform many spells, but just being able to feel the wand and practice moving it had been a big help.

He was now ten and his father seemed to think that when he entered Durmstrang later this year, he would have a leg up on the rest of the children. All the wizards Gellert knew were adults, so he couldn't say, but he knew he was more intelligent than a boy his age had any right to be. He was curious, observant, and he had a strange knack for remembering things. It had always come easily to him, as had grasping new concepts and just casting magic in general. Hyper-fixating on his interests hadn't hurt him, either. He was just excited to go off to Durmstrang, one way or the other.

"Do I have to sleep?" Gellert asked. "I'm not tired --- I still feel full of energy."

"You just spent two hours running around in the freezing cold. Of course you're full of energy. All the more reason to stay in bed and let yourself calm down. With the heat of this place, it shouldn't take long."

Gellert glanced around restlessly. "But I don't want to sleep."

Johan cast his own eyes about the room as though looking for the thing that would win him this argument. "What if I read you a story?"

Gellert scrunched up his face. "I've read all the books in this room. There's nothing in here that would be new to me."

"I'm not talking about a book in this room." Gellert felt interest fill him despite himself. He found himself sitting up and leaning towards his father. "There are some books I don't let you touch," he said with a smile.

"I thought you said you didn't have many books before we moved here?"

"Only a few. You've never touched any of them."

"Are they dangerous?" Gellert had heard of dangerous magics. Curses and dark spells that most people feared to mention. It quickened his pulse just thinking about it; it made him feel much like he had in the heat of the snowball fight he'd just had with his father.

"Not dangerous, no," said Johan. "They're just old, expensive, or precious."

Gellert frowned. "What's the difference between expensive and precious? Aren't they just synonyms?"

"Sometimes," his father admitted. "If something is expensive, that just means that somebody will pay you lots of money for it. If something is precious... that can mean all sorts of things. The book I'm talking about now is precious to me. It's one of the first I remember reading and I've kept it ever since."

"And you were worried I would damage it?"

"Worried about the possibility, yes." That was a thing Gellert liked about his father. He never lied to him; though maybe that was because Gellert picked up on things that most children his age would have no hope of picking up on.

"And that's also why you'll read it to me but you won't let me read it on my own?"

"Correct again."

Gellert's interest was piqued. "What is this book?"

"A book of stories. Would you like to hear one of them?" Gellert nodded; he was hardly one to turn down such things. "If I read you one of the stories, you have to promise me you'll sleep."

Gellert made a face but waved his hand. "Yes, yes, I'll sleep."

His father left the room, leaving Gellert alone with the crackling sound of the fire and the soft patches of shadow it cast around the room. The way they moved as the fire flickered almost made them look alive from where Gellert was lying on the bed, though he wasn't alone with them for long.

His father was carrying a small, leather-bound book when he returned. It looked entirely unremarkable but for its title. Gellert squinted at its cover, but he couldn't read it. It was written in runes. His father had started to teach him some basic runes several months ago, but it was slow going. Johan had never been strong in the subject and books on such magics were expensive. His father did seem to know enough to read this book though, so that was at least something.

"What's it called?" asked Gellert.

"The Tales of Beedle the Bard."

"The... what?"

His father smiled. "It's a collection of old stories. It won't teach you magic, but there are things to learn from it."

Gellert's patience was waning --- it had never been something he had been good at maintaining. "So, you're going to read one of them?"

"I am." His father paged through the ancient-looking book. Gellert could see the delicate care with which his father handled the tome and only became more interested. "What about a story about three exceptionally powerful wizards and Death?"

"And... Death?"

"Death as in the being, not the thing." Gellert could tell Johan was trying to resist smirking. "Well, there's a good deal of the thing, too." The man looked back down to the pages. "Or I can find a different one if you'd like?"

"No," said Gellert, "I want that one." He wanted to be a powerful wizard in his own right, and the idea of Death sounded interesting enough. His father had effectively managed to capture his attention.

Johan paged back to the story and cleared his throat. Gellert looked down at the page as he did. He knew almost none of the runes, but there was one symbol that caught his eye. It was no Rune he knew of and it didn't resemble what he thought a rune ought to look like. It was a roughly sketched triangular symbol with some sort of circle and line enclosed within it. He tried to look closer, but there wasn't much to see. Yet somehow, Gellert felt drawn to it, as if there was more at play here than simple shapes.

Before he could ask about the mark, his father began to read.

Harry sat slowly up in bed. These visions did not jolt him now the way they had when he had seen Wylla Nurmen put to death. He had not experienced one for a while now, but he found himself unsurprised when he had appeared in a room he had never known. It was just a thing he had to deal with now. Something that he could not escape and something that weighed on him every bit as heavily as Aberforth's cruelty, Draco's betrayal, and the mystery of Dobby and the Chamber of Secrets.

Yet he did not despise them as he once had. The first vision had caused him to vomit more violently than ever before. It had felt like his very stomach was trying to force its way up his throat to no avail and he had hated every single second of it. He still had his own nightmares about what Grindelwald had felt whilst dreaming of being burnt alive. He was sure he would never forget the burning pain. The fact it had not been his own was of no consequence; he still often woke and had to fumble his hands over his chest just to make sure his skin wasn't running down his body like fallen droplets of water.

He found that the more of Grindelwald's memories he saw, the more conflicted he became, yet he did not hate them, nor could he find it within himself to hate the boy. Harry couldn\'t imagine that boy doing all of the things Grindelwald had done, though he was starting to understand exactly why the one-time dark lord may have done all of those things. The motivations were there and Harry found he couldn't begrudge him for the way he thought and the way he felt. He didn't know if it made him just as evil as Grindelwald, or just a child sympathizing with a man he had never known.

He leant more towards the latter, for now, as he found himself almost hoping to see more of these visions. They were an escape from his own problems, even if they did burden him in an entirely different way. They were a way for him to see a world he would never see and live a life he would never live. They taught him history --- of muggles and of magic --- and they interested him more than any of his classes. Only his lessons with Cassie on duelling and with Dumbledore on Occlumency rivalled the visions on the front of intrigue.

It scared Harry. He was terrified that these thoughts came to him. It horrified him every time he went to sleep at night and he wished, even in the back of his mind, to see another excerpt of Grindelwald's life. Cold fingers seemed to run up his spine every time the desire prodded seductively at the corners of his mind, making him shiver more effectively than any Scottish winter could ever dream of doing.

It was all too much, yet he wanted more. He should not want anything more on his plate and he worried he might soon crack under the pressure of it all. Yet still, he craved more information and more experiences. He wondered then --- as he laid in his hospital bed and tried to get back to sleep; doing his best to ignore the way his very bone seemed to have broken apart into a hundred jagged rocks all seeking to pierce his skin at every opportunity --- whether or not Grindelwald had meant for this all to happen and whether or not breaking Harry was exactly what the former dark lord wanted to accomplish.

***Later that day...***

Having the bones in one's arm regrown via Skelegro was hell. That was the only thing Harry could definitively say he had learned from his most recent stay in the hospital wing. There were many pieces he had been presented with pertaining to the Chamber of Secrets, but he felt as though that puzzle was far too complicated to even consider solving. Dobby had seemed to be worried for him, for some strange reason, but until those worries found any grounding in reality, Harry was staying well away from the entire thing. Everything had been going so well during his first year until he had tried to get involved in the year's mystery. That had led to the death of his fellow student as well as a hospital stay of his own. He had no interest in repeating the incident this year, and he had more than enough on his plate without dealing with something as dangerous and complicated as Salazar Slytherin's fabled chamber.

He kept glancing over his shoulder as he left the hospital wing and edged his way towards the dungeons. He wasn't sure the end of the Quidditch match had ended the heated encounters between Gryffindors and Slytherins. Perhaps it had, but it was a chance he wasn't going to take. Not after seeing what the likes of the Weasley twins had done to some of the more vocal upper-year Slytherins. Not that he was complaining. A few of them had been among the number who had given him hell earlier in the school year, but he doubted the red-headed demons would know that Harry didn't get along with them. He didn't suspect the twins, or most other Gryffindors, discriminated. If they saw green robes, that was likely all the proof of an enemy they needed.

He neared the marble staircase before he heard footsteps. His ears pricked up. He had been exploring the castle as of late to find any other passages that could be accessed via Parseltongue. He had found one in an alcove under the staircase he was now approaching that led him quite close to the Slytherin common room. He could perhaps slip into the passage before whoever was coming drew too near, just in case it was an unfriendly lion. If he misjudged the timing and they saw him though... it was a risk he could not take.

His fingers twitched and he reached for his wand as he turned, but he had no need for it. "Thank Merlin I found you."

Diana looked slightly more disheveled than usual. That was still relatively close to immaculate, but it was less so than Harry was accustomed to. Her chest rose and fell rhythmically as she breathed a touch faster than was necessary and several locks of her platinum-blonde hair were out of place.

"Why were you looking for me?" Harry asked, eyeing the older girl up and down.

"Not here," she said, glancing around the hall. "Come on, we can talk outside."

Autumn was aging in Scotland. As its time to dwell drew shorter, so did the days. The season seemed to wane as the temperature fell, and with it went the last vestiges of what had been a smouldering hot summer. The leaves were still strewn across the grounds like splatters of vibrant paint upon a lush green canvas, but that canvas was dotted with white now. It had yet to snow properly, but frost coated what appeared to be each and every blade of grass in Harry's field of vision. He shivered against the frigid air, though there appeared to be no wind today. He had not been dressed for such weather.

"You couldn't have picked a warmer time to drag me outside? Or at least let me grab my cloak?"

Diana's lips twitched as she led him off towards the lake. "You're a wizard, are you not? If Draco knows how to cast a Warming Charm, I'm sure you do too."

His face suddenly felt a touch less cold as colour rose to his cheeks, but he withdrew his wand nonetheless and cast the aforementioned charm. Casting it felt like the first few seconds after one sat in a bath of perfectly warm water. The warmth, unfortunately, fled as fast as that of water once one took to their feet and stepped out of a tub, so it needed to be applied more often than Harry would like. He had heard some of the older students talk about tying the spell into their clothes, but he knew such magic was currently leagues beyond him.

Harry watched Draco's sister carefully. Diana had always moved with a sort of grace that couldn't be taught, but she seemed to move more stiffly today. Where normally she flowed from one movement to the next, now every shift of her body seemed rigid, forced, and tentative, as though she was unsure what might come next.

"You wanted to talk to me?"

"I wanted to warn you, but I guess talking is one word for it."

Harry's heart quickened its beat. He actually fought down a sigh; what the hell had happened now? "Warn me? About what?"

"A student was found petrified last night."

Harry considered telling her that he knew about Colin Creevey, but he thought better of it. He would have to come up with a slightly altered story convincing enough to fool the extremely perceptive Malfoy heiress, else he would need to explain to her all the other things he thought best kept to himself. He could tell her about Dobby... he had deduced whilst lying awake the night before that it had likely been the elf who had cursed the bludger if it wasn't one of the Weasley twins, but he wasn't sure how he wanted to handle that quite yet. He wanted to make sure it wasn't one of the twins, first, for one thing, and then he would decide what to do.

"It was a student this time?"

"A Gryffindor first year." She was watching him very closely, he realized. Her grey eyes seemed locked onto his green and there was an intensity there Harry had never seen before. "Colin Creevey --- he was the mousy-haired muggleborn boy who was trying to take photos of you after the game."

She waited for something, but Harry didn't know what. He frowned as the gears began turning inside his mind. What in Merlin's name was she waiting for? The way she watched him carefully... nervously...

Oh... no, surely not.

"You can't mean... nobody thinks---"

"That you did it?" Diana finished. "Nobody with a brain, no. The problem is, most people here don't seem to have one." Harry opened his mouth to speak, but Diana raised a hand to forestall him. "Most people don't think you're the Heir of Slytherin, to be clear. I don't really think anyone actually believes it, but a bunch of the Gryffindors have practically been shouting it from the rooftops."

"Why?" Harry struggled to keep his voice steady, but even he could hear the way it wavered with a note of anger he failed to suppress. "How could anyone think it's---"

"I don't think that most of them actually think it's you---"

"Okay, then pretending to, or whatever. Why? I haven't done anything to any of them---"

"You beat them at Quidditch."

He spluttered. "But that's... that's..."

"Ridiculous?" Diana asked. "Childish? Petty? Yes, it's all of those, but I don't think it's the only reason. Turnabout is fair play. Every Slytherin worth their green tie has been prancing about the school calling Weasley the Heir for the last week. I don't think *anyone* actually believes he's the Heir, but we still all went around saying it. I think it's the same thing here."

"Some people really do believe Weasley is the Heir, though. I heard some of the first years talking about it the other night. A couple of Hufflepuffs were doing a horrible job of whispering about it in the library, too."

Diana frowned. "I wonder how thick a human can get sometimes. Then I remember that Hufflepuffs exist."

Harry tried to suppress a snort, but he was only partially successful and the endeavour ended with him hiding a half variant behind his hand. "Didn't you tell Draco not to talk down to the badgers back in Madam Malkin's?"

"Oh, come on, Harry, you're smarter than that. I was telling Draco not to come off like an arrogant toerag the first time he met you; I just didn't say it in those words."

A tense silence stretched between them. The cold air seemed to rush down Harry's throat all at once and solidify into a frozen block of ice in the back of his throat. He found that words would not rise to his mouth or form on his tongue. The mention of Draco had imposed a gag seemingly formed from the manifestation of awkwardness itself.

"Anyway," said Diana, "the point is that the Gryffindors are trying to tell everyone that you're the Heir of Slytherin. None of us are going to stand for it. I've heard the chasers scheming all day; I think they're trying to decide the best way to send Wood, or Weasley, or both to the infirmary. If people really are thick enough to believe that Weasley is the Heir though, they might actually start listening to the idiots in red."

Harry reeled with the injustice of it all. He found there was no need to cast the Warming Charm now. His blood felt as though it was steaming beneath his skin now. Cold seemed to dissipate as soon as it touched him; he was surprised he wasn't surrounded by thick clouds of dense, misty steam.

"So, I'm going to have to deal with every Gryffindor and any gullible idiot without a brain coming for my head? Is that what you're saying?"

"That's the right of it, I think, yes."

Harry ran a hand through his hair. He thought about bringing up Draco and the upper years. Whether the latter would take this chance to come after Harry again, and whether the former would perhaps use this as a bridge to cross and start rebuilding their friendship. He knew that thought was wishful even as it formed, but he could not help hoping.

"Is there anything else?"

"Nothing that you can't figure out on your own. The rivalry has gotten even worse since the match. The Weasley twins set up some sort of rune cluster trap outside the Slytherin common room last night. A group of fifth years leaving to go and get more food from the kitchens for the party ended up in the infirmary with horrible burns. The runes on the floor lit their robes on fire as soon as they stepped on the floor outside the common room."

That... was an escalation. All the cases of students in the infirmary so far had been relatively minor. A couple of concussions had been the worst of it, but this... this was taking the conflict to an entirely new level.

"So, the Gryffindors want to frame me for a crime and probably make my life a living hell. Some people might actually be stupid enough to believe them and try and curse me in the back, and the Weasley twins might want to actually kill me just because I'm wearing green?"

Diana shrugged. "I'm not sure if they actually wanted to kill or if they're just careless idiots, but it all works out to the same point, I suppose."

"Right," Harry said bitterly, making a conscious effort not to scowl. "Is there any good news?"

Diana smiled. "That the bad news is over and we can just spend some time out here before Scotland decides that going out onto the grounds is an offence punishable by frostbite?"

Harry could not help but laugh. Draco might be a childish prat, but he still liked Diana.

***That night, in the hidden room...***

Ron was breathing heavily by the time Cedric's voice rang through the hidden room and called for a stop to their spell casting. They had focused on casting jinxes and hexes whilst moving tonight. It had actually been Susan's idea. Her aunt was the Head of the DMLE and had been an auror for a brief time. She had seen many aurors through training so Susan had written her for basic ideas to start improving as a duellist. This had been one of the drills she had suggested.

Ron thought the woman either needed to be given an Order of Merlin or be beaten over the head with a broomstick. He had noticed marginal improvements already, but his legs felt like lead and his lungs as if they were full of smoke. His chest heaved with the effort of breathing and he felt as if he would throw up at any moment.

He had spent several months working on spells and all the rest, but he had never realized how bloody tiring any of this could be. Perhaps he should have been running instead of reading... or maybe that was just the part of his brain that wanted to be on a broomstick every time he opened a book. It was persistent, but pretty easy to shut up. Calling forth the image of Neville's grave usually did the trick quite effectively.

"Good practice, everyone," said Cedric, turning to the auburn-haired Bones heiress. "Thanks again for the help, Susan. Write your aunt and tell her the same, if you don't mind." Susan smiled and nodded. Cedric raised his wand and caused the time to display in front of him. "A few minutes before we need to worry about curfew," he said, turning to Ron. "How are you feeling after yesterday's game?"

Ron scowled. "Like a bumbling troll," he spat. "Potter had a bludger after him the whole bloody game and the git still beat me to the snitch."

"You looked like you were going to beat him to it," said Susan, "what happened?"

Ron's face flushed as he turned away. He didn't want to look at them as he recalled the emotions rushing through him as the bastards in green and silver chanted about him from the stands. When the song had begun, he had first thought it was coming from the Gryffindor section, but as the lyrics grew more and more incendiary, he quickly realized that was not the case. The wankers even had the nerve to chant about him being the Heir of Slytherin! Sure, they might not have said it in those words, but Ron knew he was no genius and even he had figured that part out.

"I... I fumbled it," he said after a moment. He turned back to them all, looking to the floor. His cheeks were still warm, but his skin no longer felt like it would melt off of his face from the heat of his blush. "I... it was that stupid song! I got distracted and... and..."

Cedric rested a hand on his shoulder. "It's just one match," he said kindly. "You almost had him, too. You beat seekers much older than you last year." He grinned. "I would say you could win the Quidditch Cup if Slytherin loses, but you would have to beat me to the snitch."

Ron shoved him back, hard, and the older boy laughed. Even the youngest male Weasley was grinning now. "Prat," he said, hiding his own laughter behind his hand as it rose up within him.

"What do you think about what they're saying about him?" asked Hannah. She sounded nervous, but she often did. She was definitely the shyest of the group.

"It's more likely than Ron," said Hermione with some disdain.

"It's rubbish," said Cedric. "The rest of your house just want to get back at Slytherin for the match."

"Do they, though?" asked Susan. "That boy goes and tries to take photos of Potter while he's embarrassed and injured, and then he just shows up petrified that night?"

"He is also a Slytherin," Hannah muttered darkly.

"That doesn't mean he's some kind of child dark lord," argued Cedric. "Just because You-Know-Who was a Slytherin doesn't mean they're all bad."

"Haven't met many good ones," said Ron. He had nothing against Slytherin as a general rule, but most of them had treated him like rubbish ever since the first day he had arrived at the castle.

"Sirius Black was a Gryffindor." Ron grimaced at Cedric's words, but nodded. The boy had a point there that could not be disputed. "There's no way Potter's the Heir. No second year could do any of what's happened."

"They thought nobody could survive the curse You-Know-Who hit him with either," Hermione reminded them all. "Some people say that Potter must have had some sort of power that even *he* didn't have."

"Don't be ridiculous," said Cedric, "he was a baby."

"A baby who destroyed the most powerful dark sorcerer of all time."

Cedric sighed. "Look, believe what you want, but don't go spreading this nonsense about Potter around. If you believe it, then fine, but don't go spreading it."

"I'm not saying I believe it," Hermione said quickly, "just that it seems silly to just pretend it isn't possible."

"Do what you like," said Cedric. "I'm confident that it isn't Potter. If I'm wrong, I'll eat my words."

***November 18, 1992***

***The Library***

***8:43 PM***

Harry's neck ached as he straightened up in his chair. He had been leaning over a book on intermediate Transfiguration for hours and every muscle from his shoulders up seemed to have tied themselves in a painfully throbbing knot. Every time Harry moved his neck, it felt as though his muscles collided and entangled with one another, ripping and tearing as they went.

He enjoyed Daphne, Tracey, Blaise, and the others, but the group was rarely all together in one place. They would more often break off into smaller groups and do their own individual things. Harry went to the library any time this happened. Those times had been more frequent this month and he had gone off on his own more than ever before --- whether it be to explore the library, practice spells in abandoned classrooms, or to explore the castle, Harry seemed to be off doing his own thing more often than not these days.

It was probably because there were just so many things plaguing his thoughts. The whole moral dilemma involving Grindelwald, his detentions with Aberforth, and the fact that a good third of the school was set so vehemently against him. He could scarcely walk down a corridor without having some form of magic hurled at his back.

Some of the older students were even bold enough to do it to his face, but none of the younger ones. Not after he had sent a large third-year boy to the hospital wing and a second-year scampering when he had tried to attack him after the fact. That had earned him some respect, but the respect had manifested as wariness, not admiration. It had strengthened the idiots' case against him, if anything, and it just meant that people planned their strikes more carefully now.

He was sick and tired of all of it and it was weighing on him too heavily. He felt like fresh iron twisted to its breaking point. He was stubborn and unwavering, but eventually, he would break. If he wanted to avoid that, he was going to have to do something, but he would not get involved this year... not directly.

He had put a great deal of thought into the matter of the Chamber of Secrets over the past number of weeks. If he wanted to go back to not living a hellacious existence at Hogwarts, he was going to have to somehow prove he was innocent. He was also going to have to do that without putting himself in the line of fire this time, and the easiest way to start was by figuring out what the hell was going on.

He planned to ask Dumbledore about the Chamber of Secrets the next time they practiced Occlumency. He doubted the Headmaster would be all that forthcoming, but he had always encouraged Harry's questions and they had now reached the state of practice at which Dumbledore was launching actual probes into his mind. They were weak and blunt, easy to detect and easy to deflect, but it was a start. If he seemed particularly fatigued after one of these lessons and Dumbledore was in a good enough mood... well, the old man was known for his generosity. It wasn't out of the question that he might allow his tongue to loosen for a brief bit of time.

But that was far from a sure bet and Harry needed to know what was going on. If not Dumbledore, he needed someone else who knew anything. McGonagall had sounded every bit as confused as Harry when she'd spoken with the Headmaster in the hospital wing that night, and Harry would never have gone to her anyway. The same went for the rest of the staff, which left him with only one option.

Dobby had known something. Perhaps at Malfoy Manor, Harry might have thought the elf was bluffing, but not now. The bludger had been examined and the staff had concluded that the ball had not been tampered with by any means that they knew of. The Weasley twins were good, but not that good. Daphne had told him once when discussing house elves that their magic worked differently than that of witches and wizards. It would explain why none of the professors had been able to unearth anything and it would explain why Dobby had been watching him that night in the hospital wing.

He could have told Diana, but something held him back. There would just be a lot to explain and it felt... outside of their current dynamic. He would have told Draco at the school year's start, but that was now firmly out of the question. Lord Malfoy had always encouraged Harry to write, but he was the member of the family Harry thought most likely to have been manipulating him the whole time. Daphne's words had struck home with him and there really were a startling number of coincidences. Most of them were absolutely well within Lucius Malfoy's capabilities to engineer.

But he had not been the only member of the Malfoy family to encourage Harry to write.

He rolled his head to work out the cramp in his neck as he reached down and withdrew a sheet of parchment from his bag. A quill followed and he pressed its tip to the parchment.

*Lady Malfoy...*

***Durmstrang Institute***

***8:37 PM***

Gellert's feet slammed into the ground with more force than he had been expecting. Summer was still in full bloom back in his native homeland of Germany. The grass was still a lush green and the ground was softened by the sun's warm glow.

None of that was true here.

There was no give to the Earth that his feet slammed into. He might as well have landed on solid concrete for how tightly packed the ground was beneath him.

That was the first thing he noticed. The next was the biting cold. September had not yet spread its wings and flown into prominence, yet the air was as frigid as one would expect in a German winter. The wind seemed dormant, but it was a small mercy. Even bundled up in so much fur that Gellert thought his legs would buckle from the weight, he shivered.

It was dark, too. Much darker than it would have been in Germany. It appeared to be the middle of the night and he thought he would have been lost had it not been for the thin layer of shining white snow that coated the ground all around him and the splendid sight laid out before him.

He had landed a ways up what appeared to be one of many mountains that formed a perfect ring around a vast expanse of frozen land. The mountain he found himself on had a path carved roughly into its side. The path led down the mountain and continued all the way across the grounds, leading for some time until it reached the building Gellert knew he was here for.

It was a great castle, though not in the way many castles of myths were great. It was squat compared to most of them and it was not made of any bright and shiny stones. It was comprised completely of hard grey rock and had only four floors, though the ceilings of each did not seem high. There was not a great deal to say of the structure. It was solid and seemed as though it had stood forever and would endure forevermore. It looked ready to withstand a siege at any moment, though it was perhaps unfit to hold great and splendid banquets for men and women of the highest esteem.

The only reason Gellert could make it out in such detail at all was because of the vantage point he had thanks to the mountain, for the castle itself was surrounded by a high wall of the same solid grey stone that it was crafted from. The wall was about half as high as the castle and there appeared only to be one gated entrance through the impenetrable wall of stone.

Yet the defences did not end there. He could hear rushing water from all around him. It seemed to roar like a lion and clap against the shore like a hundred thunderbolts in the relative silence of the night. It was everywhere; he could see four lakes spread across the grounds from here alone and there was a great moat that enclosed both the castle and its wall. There were a number of bridges across that were all lowered, as far as Gellert could see, but he doubted that was often the case.

The castle itself might not have been the most dazzling sight in the world, but the path that led to it was positively enchanting.

The entire path was lined by knights made completely from ice on both sides. They stood nearly ten-feet tall and held the largest torches that Gellert had ever seen. Yet the mechanisms in their hands did not flicker with the orange glow of fire. They shone with a pale magical light that was almost as bright as the snow. The snow and light seemed to try and outshine one another, painting the long, straight path in a pale halo of magical light that took Gellert's breath away. The lakes on either side of the path shone ghostly in their light. If not for their restless churning, Gellert suspected the light would have rendered them every bit as transparent as the shining surface of Lake Königssee all the times he had peered down from atop the mountain and looked wondrously into its depths.

There were sounds all around him as his fellow classmates landed. Their feet hit the ground every bit as hard as his and they all wore the same uniform that he himself was adorned in. They all looked at one another but did not say so much as a word as more and more of them appeared.

When the constant bluish blurs of portkeys finally ceased, the lot of them were left huddled together at the mouth of the path and shivering against the biting cold. Gellert wondered why none of them moved towards the castle, but he found he did not have the impulse to do it. He was frozen by the cold and the air of such a place. Magic seemed to hum all around him and the way the light shone made the entire thing feel completely and totally surreal.

A noise from below drew their collective attention and they all turned. The two nearest knights had moved forward as if they were alive. They held their magical torches aloft in one hand and hefted long, great swords in the other. It was with these that they beckoned all of the first years forward. No one moved for a moment until Gellert took a deep breath and became the first to step forward. Once he moved, the others followed all at once and the icy figures turned. They stood side by side and walked in perfect unison, marching the new crop of students like a procession of well-trained soldiers down towards the castle nestled in the centre of this frozen expanse of land.

The walk was long and cold. They had to walk past many of the lakes along their trek. It had seemed windless on their perch high on one of the mountains, but the air seemed to slash across their faces like whips of ice as they passed by the water. It left Gellert's cheeks stinging and his nose running, but he did not react. His father had told him to stay strong and vigilant.

The descent to the castle felt as though it took forever, but they had eventually crossed the moat and passed through the gate. There were two more knights of ice standing guard at the castle's front entrance, but they swiftly moved aside to allow the first years and their enchanted escorts to pass.

Torch brackets hung along the walls of a long and narrow corridor that greeted the first years as soon as they stepped into the castle. The brackets shone with the same magical light held by their escorts. Gellert thought the corridor would be nearly pitch-black if not for the light, but he wasn't sure he wouldn't have preferred that. It cast strange, leaping shadows about the walls. They seemed to lurk just out of sight before lunging forth. Several times during the walk down the hall, Gellert had taken them for sudden movement out of the corner of his eye.

Finally, the corridor ended. There was another to the left and right, but before them was a massive room that they were led into by their two guards of honour.

This room was lit more scarcely than the corridor outside, though perhaps it only seemed that way because of its size. There were no windows, but it was a very long room. At its front was a table of rich, dark wood, at which sat men who must have been the professors. Less comfortable tables spread across the rest of the hall. They were longer than the professors' and lined up one behind the other like rows of desks in a classroom. There were seven of them in total and he knew at once that each of them were for a separate year. Gellert and the rest of the first years were led to the back of the hall. Only then did their guards of ice march to the front of the professors' table, bow in perfect unison to an old, hard-looking man who sat in a black, throne-like chair, and leave the hall. There were a number of other knights of ice all throughout the room; it seemed that the service of these two was no longer required.

Gellert's eyes seemed to devour the room as the man who sat the black throne took to his feet. Gellert hardly noticed. His eyes darted from one knight of ice, to a magical sphere of light, and back again. He watched the older students, too. Some of them watched the first years and others still conversed in low voices, but these students were scarce. Most of them sat with straight backs and polite expressions, their complete and undivided attention fixated upon the tall, old man who had taken to his feet.

Gellert cared naught for old men. Gellert cared for the castle and the magic and all he would learn. Gellert cared for all of the dreams he would fulfill. Gellert cared for one, undeniable truth. He was finally at the place he had belonged for all of his years.

***November 20, 1992***

***The Headmaster's Office***

***9:56 PM***

Harry resisted the urge to groan as he sat back in his chair. His head felt as though someone had stabbed him behind the eyes with something sharp and scalding. He often felt like this nowadays after he completed a lesson in Occlumency with the Headmaster. They had progressed to the point at which Dumbledore was actively deploying Legilimency probes against him. He was becoming more and more proficient at fending off his attacks. Harry knew they were deliberately weak and blunt, but it was a start.

"You are doing well," Dumbledore said as though still reading his thoughts. "Your progression is exponential. Your leaps grow further and your bounds higher the longer these lessons progress. It is really quite astonishing."

"Thank you, sir." Harry couldn't help but feel warm at the sentiment. He wasn't usually one to allow compliments like this to touch him. Compliments about him as a person were one thing --- those had been non-existent whilst on Privet Drive and were still nearly as alien to him as Diagon Alley had been that first day with Hagrid. He had been praised enough in the last year by professors to take academic compliments for what they were. When they came from the greatest wizard alive, however, and referred to something he was genuinely passionate about... "Thank you again for the help."

"I owed you that much," said Dumbledore. "I could hardly refuse you after what you went through last June."

Harry allowed a deep frown to spread across his face. He would need to tread carefully through this bit of the conversation. "I was hoping that would be the last thing like that to happen at Hogwarts."

The light behind Dumbledore's eyes seemed to dim by a margin. "As did I, Harry, as did I." He cast his eyes about the room. "It is interesting the patterns that befall this school."

"Patterns, sir?"

"Yes, indeed." The man's fingers tapped rhythmically upon the surface of his desk as his lips pulled tightly together. It appeared to Harry as though he was pondering something very deeply. "Hogwarts has been a safe haven for many years. Its reputation as being one of the safest places in Britain is well-founded. Yet you and I both know all that transpired last year and we are just as painfully aware of what is currently taking place within our very walls."

"Is there a reason, sir? You said that Hogwarts was safe for a long time. Is there a reason that this is the second year in a row that it isn't? One could have just been a coincidence, but two in a row seems a bit off for a place that's supposed to be so safe."

"It does, yes. I have my suspicions, but I am afraid I cannot present any true evidence for any of them beyond the patterns I spoke of earlier."

"Can you explain those, sir?"

"I can, though some would argue doing so would be unwise." His fingers tapped upon the desk once more. "The last time Hogwarts experienced anything like the last two years was half a century ago. There was a year much like this, but it was not the only thing of note. There were... troubling things taking place for a number of years. Troubling things that all seemed to happen around a young, brilliant boy."

Harry's frown deepened. "I'm not seeing the pattern, sir?"

"Aren't you?" Dumbledore smiled thinly. "You are the pattern, Harry."

Harry's mouth went dry. "Me?"

"You are the closest thing Hogwarts has seen to this boy in all of those years. Both halfbloods, both Slytherins, why, even both orphans. There are other things, too. This boy displayed an aptitude for magic the likes of which I had not seen for many years. You have a similar gift. A natural ease with which you wield the force and bend it to your will. It is a rare talent, but one that cannot bloom truly without the proper mind to give it fuel."

"Professor Flitwick said something like that last year," Harry remembered. "We talked about it in the library. He said I was by far the most talented student in the year but that I needed to focus more on magical theory."

"I do remember Filius mentioning a conversation of the like. Tell me, Harry, did you focus more on the more subtle facets of magic?"

"Yes, sir --- I've been doing all I can to get ahead."

"Very good. Do feel free to come to me with any questions if you find yourself stuck. I understand if you don't wish to trouble your professors with more advanced material --- though any of them would be glad to assist you. I do so love magic, just as I really do miss teaching. Alas, my schedule is quite full these days and time makes fools of even the greatest of men."

Harry found that his mouth felt dry again. He wanted something from this conversation, but that had not been it. It had not been what he had expected, but it was a resource he would most certainly be leaning on in the future. He would be foolish not to --- what kind of idiot would turn down help from the most brilliant magician alive?

"Thank you, sir. I... appreciate it. I'll think of some things you might be able to help with."

"Splendid," said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling once more, "now, where were we?"

"You were talking about me and the boy from fifty years ago."

"Ah, yes. There was much that happened at Hogwarts during his time here, yet the castle grew quite quiet once he left." His lips twitched. "Well, it was far from quiet whilst your father and his marauding group of friends and admirers dwelled here, but it was never truly dangerous in the way it is now. The castle remained perfectly safe until your first year, and I am afraid it has not grown safer since."

"So... you're saying that when students with higher potential come to Hogwarts, it gets more dangerous?"

"Something like that, yes. Great men attract greater things. People fair and foul flock to them like moths to an open flame. It can lead to prosperity, but it can also lead to danger. The fact that you are the defeater of Voldemort and the most famous student to ever walk the halls only makes you even more sought after."

Harry remembered the way Dobby had spoken of the plot at Hogwarts and he remembered the way the elf had specifically wanted him to stay far away from the great castle. Was it possible that something about the Chamber of Secrets being opened had something to do with him?

"Sir... is me being here causing these things to happen?"

"Perhaps, though it is through no fault of your own if that is the case. You certainly had nothing to do with the petrification of poor Master Creevey."

Well, at least Dumbledore wasn't blinded by the Gryffindors' baseless accusations. That much was obvious, but part of him had still been holding tension throughout the entire meeting. That small part of him that wondered whether Dumbledore thought him the Heir of Slytherin.

"Sir... have you or any of the other teachers found anything about the Chamber of Secrets?"

"I am afraid not," said Dumbledore. The lines etched upon his aged face suddenly seemed deeper and more pronounced. "I am hopeful that will change, but not entirely optimistic."

"Are you worried you and the professors might not be able to stop whatever's happening?"

Dumbledore sighed. "I will not be the first Headmaster who has looked for Salazar's fabled chamber, nor will I be the last. It will not even be the first time I go looking for such a place. Let us hope that I am more successful than I was all those years ago."

"Is this the first time the Chamber of Secrets has been opened?"

Dumbledore watched him very carefully. "It is not," he said at last. "I did say that dangerous things happened at Hogwarts all those years ago, did I not?"

Harry's eyes widened. "One of those things was the chamber being opened?"

"Indeed." Dumbledore looked up towards the clock upon the wall. "Goodness me, the time grows late and curfew draws near. You'd best be off to bed, Harry. I would not wish for you to be late on my account."

Harry made for the door, recognizing his dismissal, his thoughts whirling. He had gotten more than he had bargained for in this meeting.

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***10:34 PM***

Harry's body ached with every step he took. He was grateful for Cassie walking alongside him as they neared the smooth stone steps that led down into the Hogwarts dungeons. He thought it unlikely he would topple down them, but he would not completely discount the possibility. Tonight had been one of their more taxing practices. There had been a great deal of mock duelling. Harry was still a very long way off from even competing with Cassie, but he was improving greatly. The older Slytherin was confident she was the best duelist in the school, so she wasn't exactly who Harry should be comparing himself against. Not to say that he wasn't doing that, but it did make the bruises sting less and the aches of his muscles felt a touch more bearable.

"Unitatis," said Cassie as they reached the common room minutes later, causing the stone wall to slide aside with its usual groan that for some reason seemed unusually ominous.

The air in the common room was tense. Harry knew something was amiss as soon as he stepped inside. His eyes swept around the room and did not immediately recognize what exactly had created such tension.

Most students were lounging in chairs as usual. The first thing he noticed was that none of them seemed buried in their homework, or books, or other pursuits that necessitated their eyes to be cast downwards. Their heads were all raised and tilted in the same direction. Only when Harry followed the pattern did he see the commotion, though it was hard to make out exactly what was happening, for a larger cluster of students enclosed the action so tightly that seeing through their ranks was nearly impossible.

Cassie --- who was years older and much taller than Harry --- must have seen. She strode forward without a seconds' hesitation, flicking her wand back into her hand. Harry followed curiously behind her, drawing his own wand in the process. He wasn't sure whether it was the older girl's status as a prefect or reputation as a duelist that encouraged the crowd to move aside, but they did so with no complaints.

When they parted, Harry wasn't sure what he had expected to see, but what he saw was not it. Two first years had been enclosed by the circle, but one was standing and one was lying face down. His robes were torn and blood pooled around him like a dark crimson puddle as he tried to rise. The one standing over him had the same golden-blond hair as Cassie and his wand was raised. He was halfway through another slash when Cassie grabbed his arm.

The boy whirled and tried to bring his wand up to fire a spell, but he was frozen in place by his older sister's stare before an incantation could form on his tongue.

"And what exactly have you been doing?" Cassie's voice was soft, but dangerous. It was a stark contrast to her usually outgoing and borderline bubbly persona. It took Harry aback, but her brother did not waver.

"Putting this prat in his place." He gestured towards the fallen boy who was still struggling to rise. Judging by the way his leg kept buckling, the gaping wound just below his shoulder blades wasn't the only damage he had taken in the conflict. Harry would be remiss to call it a duel; it had been much too one-sided by the look of it.

He remembered what Lucius had said about the Yaxleys and what Lord Corbin had then affirmed. They were a family renowned for duelling. It was a sort of tradition for members of House Yaxley to spend several years post Hogwarts on the duelling circuit. They were trained in the art from an early age and Harry knew first-hand that both Corban and Cassandra were excellent instructors. It was no surprise that the youngest of them, Cadmus, was the better of the two first years, but this had not been a victory --- it had been a bloody massacre.

"There is a time and a place." Cassie spoke in the same tone of voice she had before, but still her brother remained far from cowed. "You could have killed him, you idiot." She glanced around at the gathered crowd. Most of them were first years, though a few were in the second or third year; Harry even thought he saw a few older students gathered among them. "Why did none of you stop this?"

Every pair of eyes in the gathered crowd seemed to fall to the floor when Cassie spoke. The only exception Harry saw were two pairs of dark brown eyes belonging to girls who looked startlingly identical to one another. The Carrow twins, he remembered. He wondered not for the first time if witches and wizards were somehow more likely to have twins than muggles, but he was a touch more distracted by the way Cadmus Yaxley was glaring at him as though he had done the boy a great personal disservice.

He met his stare unflinchingly and raised an eyebrow. Yaxley's eyes narrowed as he turned back to his sister. "I wasn't going to kill him," he spat. "I know what I'm doing. I don't need you to teach me or lecture me on how to do things."

He wrenched his arm from his sister's grip and threw one last disdainful look at Harry before storming off. Harry watched him leave warily, his hand not far from his wand. He wasn't sure what he had done to draw the younger boy's ire, but he was not going to be attacked by him whilst unaware. It was typical that he would have to watch for yet another viper lurking in the shadows.

Cassie dispersed the crowd and ordered the other first year --- a slight boy named Martin Harper --- to be taken off to the hospital wing.

"So," Harry asked Daphne and the others when he took his seat alongside them, "what exactly did I miss?"

"Children being children," answered Daphne. "Harper said something about how Yaxley's father was overrated at the ministry. Yaxley said something about how at least his wasn't in Azkaban and things spiralled."

"Charming," said Harry. "Any idea why the younger Yaxley was looking at me like I had just tried to curse him in the back?"

"Probably because you walked in with the older one," said Daphne.

Harry frowned. "Why would that make him want to curse me?"

"Jealousy, spite, all kinds of childish things." She shrugged. "Don't ask me to explain how a normal eleven-year-old's mind works. It's kind of depressing and I try not to think about it."

Harry snorted. "Naturally." He glanced around at the rest of his friends and wondered whether Cadmus Yaxley's outburst had been the only thing of note to happen whilst he was gone. All of them were looking between him and Daphne as though they were waiting for something to happen. "Did I miss anything else interesting?"

Daphne's lips curved up into a cruel smile as she leant forward, a gleam dancing in her sapphire eyes. "As it happens, you did..."

***November 25, 1992***

***The Great Hall***

***8:54 AM***

*Harry,*

*Thank you for writing to me about the elf. The creature should never have been at Hogwarts. I'm sorry for all the trouble it caused you. He has been dealt with, but not before he was questioned. It was him who enchanted that wretched bludger, so you don't need to worry about anyone else having done it.*

*I'm afraid he didn't know anything about what's going on at Hogwarts. He was a mad and ill creature who hadn't been right in the head for years. There wasn't much he had to offer beyond paranoia, I'm afraid.*

*I'm glad that you wrote to me and hope you would consider continuing to do so. I've heard even less of you lately because of your argument with Draco, but it's lovely speaking with you again.*

*Write soon and enjoy the rest of your term.*

*Sincerely,*

*Narcissa*

Harry put down the letter and tried to force down his disappointment. He had been hoping that Dobby might know something about the Chamber of Secrets. Especially now that Dumbledore's cryptic history lesson had given him pause as to whether or not the whole fiasco might be somehow linked to him. He was happy the elf wouldn't be trying to kill him with any other enchanted bludgers, but he'd had other hopes for writing to Narcissa.

And the bit about writing more often...

Harry wasn't sure how to feel. Much of what the Malfoys had done screamed of manipulation. Could he trust Narcissa? He had continued to trust Diana and she had not led him astray. She had always counselled him well and he still counted her among his closest friends. She was his oldest friend now that Draco and he were no longer speaking with each other. Harry distrusted Lord Malfoy most of all. He was the one who pulled the strings in the Malfoy family. If they had manipulated him, he at least was a part of it.

But Narcissa...

He thought back to every time he had spoken with her and the memory of their first interaction floated to the forefront of his mind. It had been on Platform Nine and Three Quarters. His stomach had been filled with excitement despite the dreary and monotonous weather, for that had been the day he'd been set to travel to Hogwarts.

She had mentioned how the two of them were family and she had encouraged him to write her about that. Harry had never taken her up on it, but why not now? It wasn't really something she could use to manipulate him and it might allow him to get to know her better.

He nodded silently to himself and leant over to reach into his bag and pull out a piece of parchment, but a horrible sound from someone near the centre of the table drew his attention.

Glass shattered and sprayed everywhere. Several students cried out as it pierced their legs and coloured the hems of their robes crimson. Others manage to scramble out of the way as Damian Travers's older brother swung a knife this way and that. People practically dove for cover as he batted more silverware aside. He used one hand to slash at the air with the knife whilst he clawed at his own face with the other. Blood was blossoming on his cheeks and running down his face.

Harry would have thought that the boy might claw his own eyes out if he wasn't careful, but nothing about this screamed of caution. It was clear that Travers was out of his mind. He must have been bewitched, or poisoned, or influenced in some other way.

Poisoned...

His posture straightened so fast it was as though he had been subjected to an eletric shock. He remembered suspecting Travers of sending him bubotuber pus all those weeks ago and he remembered the few people he had told.

He doubted it was a coincidence this had happened after last night, either. Suddenly, Harry knew exactly who had poisoned the elder Travers brother.

***Four days earlier, in the Slytherin common room...***

"Oh?" asked Harry, eyeing Daphne with a mixture of interest and suspicion.

"You remember telling us that you thought Travers was the one to send you the pus?" He nodded --- it had not been long after he'd seen the boy staring at him the day the foul substance had been sent. "Well, I told you that I would be finding out who did it, and I have."

He blinked. "How?"

"Ancient Runes," she answered. "I... convinced one of his friends to draw a very specific set of runes onto a random page in one of his textbooks that he wasn't likely to look at. I carved a corresponding set and had them tied together. It lets me listen into anything he says so long as the book is nearby." Her expression turned predatory. "Today, he finally slipped."

***Back in the present...***

Harry watched as the boy writhed and clawed at his own face. Professors were rushing over now and he knew it would end at any moment, but he could not help but be transfixed by the grotesque spectacle.

Two thoughts crashed over him as swiftly as the poison must have flowed through Travers's veins.

The first was that he *really* needed to start putting much more time and effort into Ancient Runes, and the second was far more pressing and a touch more disturbing.

He felt no desire to look away from the sight before him. On the contrary, he could feel nothing as he watched. There was no pleasure, it was true, but nor was there any empathy or regret. There was only cold indifference. Conjoined with all of the other questions Harry had been asking about himself as of late, he was unsure how to feel.

***November 28, 1992***

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***9:58 PM***

A sense of déjà vu washed over Harry as he stepped into the Slytherin common room. He had finished yet another night of practice with Cassie. He was less battered this time, as the practice had consisted mostly of honing spells and techniques. The girl was also absent from him. She had gone off on her own to find something in the library before calling it a night. She had hoped to beat curfew, but Harry doubted she was worried about being caught if she wasn't fast enough.

When he re-entered the common room after the practice, it was tense once more. He wondered whether the same sort of thing had happened for a moment, but he quickly realized that it was not the same. Similar, perhaps, but there were noticeable differences.

Nobody's eyes were cast towards an ongoing spectacle. Everyone was either looking down quietly or their heads were together as they conversed in low whispers. Harry cast his gaze about the dimly-lit room. This time, he failed to identify exactly what was causing the problem, which only made him tense all the more.

He looked for his friends but found only one of them. Blaise was seated in his usual spot in the room, but Daphne, Tracey, Millicent, and Lilian were all absent. Harry's heart quickened as he made his way towards the quietest of their group. The very air seemed so thick that his movements felt impeded as he tried to close the distance between them. Something was undoubtedly wrong, but he had no idea what it might be.

"Blaise," he asked in a low whisper when he took the seat to the boy's left, "what's happened? What's going on?"

Blaise gave him a long, hard look. "You might want to go and see our Head of House." His voice was as pensive as the smooth surface of the sea. It gave away nothing as to what might dwell beneath. A chill ran up Harry's spine. Blaise was always guarded, but never had he spoken so carefully or with such clinical coolness.

But then, all confusion and worry over Blaise was wiped swiftly away when the boy uttered his next words.

"Tracey's been attacked and Snape is looking for you."

***Severus Snape's Office***

***10:24 PM***

Snape's office was as dark and ominous as Harry remembered. The low, ghostly light of the place contrasted with the floating jars and vials of things Harry didn't even have names for. Some of the things gleamed within whatever liquids they were drenched in, whilst others practically dripped with thick and colourful slime.

Harry was focusing on none of this. He had eyes only for the man sitting across the desk from him. Snape had started watching him the moment he had stepped across his threshold and his eyes had not left Harry since. It made the youth uneasy. He wanted to fidget, but he resisted the urge. Snape was exactly the kind of man who would take such movements for guilt or weakness. The last thing Harry wanted was to be falsely accused of something he had never done. If anyone in the castle was likely to do that, it was probably his own Head of House. The irony of that fact was not lost on him, but he took amusement in the sick truth of his situation.

"My, my, Potter, you have found yourself in quite the predicament, haven't you?"

A year ago, Harry thought he might have spouted off about how he had never done it and where he had been during the attack. He would have reeled off how much he liked Tracey and how he had no wish to see her hurt. A year ago, he might have made a blustering idiot of himself, but not now. Snape would ask for only what he wanted to hear. Giving more than that would make Harry seem desperate, so he resisted the urge to spew forth every single thought that flitted chaotically across his mind.

"Yes, sir," he answered instead.

"Why is it you were unaccounted for during the window of time the attack might have been carried out, Potter?"

"I was practicing, sir."

"Practicing what?"

"Practicing duelling, sir."

Snape's expression did not shift, but Harry could sense a change in him. "And why does the infamous defeater of the Dark Lord believe he needs to learn to duel?"

Because said Dark Lord wasn't dead? Because half of the house would love to see him made a fool of in front of the entire school? Because he had seen three corpses in the past year, not counting poor Wylla Nurmen via Grindelwald's visions? He could tell almost none of this to Snape.

Dumbledore had made him swear back in the hospital wing that the secret of Voldemort's return needed to be kept between the two of them. As for Grindelwald... that was an entirely different situation that troubled him more at this point than Britain's own Dark Lord or even the fate of Neville Longbottom. The way he felt while watching some of those memories... it scared him. The last thing he wanted was for a man like Snape to glean any of the reasons why it troubled him so much. Best if he had no notion about any of that.

"It's my housemates, Professor," he decided to answer. "Ever since my argument with Draco, the upper years have been hexing me in the hallways and the common room."

"Can anyone attest to this, Potter? Or am I to believe the son of a man who would tell his professors the world was ending if it would win him a moment of their attention?"

Harry felt a blush threaten to rise, but he tried hard to fight it down. Something about that comment had cut him and he could not explain why. He should have no connection to his father, yet the remark had hit home. He knew little of the man beyond his prowess at Quidditch, aptitude in Transfiguration and that he had fought against Voldemort. Narcissa was slowly revealing tidbits about the man over her letters, but they had begun coming only recently. Harry had no idea whether the insinuations Snape was hurling at his father were true. He hoped not, but he did not dare to speak up. Both because he feared the validity of his doubts and because of all the professors at Hogwarts, Snape was the one he wanted to anger least.

"I don't want attention, sir." Harry forced himself to look at Snape as he made his voice come out as polite as he could possibly manage. "I want the opposite. I wish they would leave me alone. They won't listen to me, so I want to learn to protect myself."

Snape watched him intently. Harry sensed that the man was looking for any reason to doubt him or trying to find an opening to cast aspersions, but evidently, he could find none.

"Very well. Can anyone vouch that you were indeed where you claimed to be tonight?"

"Cassandra Yaxley, sir. She's been helping me practice."

Harry thought he saw surprise flash in Snape's eyes, but it was gone so fast he was sure he'd imagined it. The Potions Master had always been as impassive as a wall made of solid stone.

"I will be speaking with Miss Yaxley next. We shall see if her word supports your tale." He leant forward and now his eyes seemed to be doing their best to burn a hole straight through Harry's face. "Can you think of anyone who would have liked to see Miss Davis petrified, Potter?"

He couldn't. If Travers had known that Daphne was the one who had poisoned him, then maybe. Perhaps he might have thought the Greengrass heiress too risky a target and settled for her halfblood friend. That would have made sense, but Travers had not yet left the care of Madam Pomfrey. They had considered sending the boy to St. Mungo's, but the school's matron had been confident she would be able to see that the boy returned to full health

Harry doubted Travers had orchestrated the attack from a hospital bed and he had no way of knowing that Daphne had been behind his own recent bout of trouble. Beyond that... Tracey was a halfblood, so there were doubtlessly some hostile upper years, but most of them largely ignored halfbloods as a general rule. They would sneer at them or shove them out of the way, but rarely would they scorn them openly. Harry was an exception --- not every halfblood had been the downfall of a man whom many of their parents had once sworn fealty to. Maybe if Tracey was a muggleborn then they may have had the desire, but outside of that...

He bit his lip as he remembered the way the house had been so willing to let Weasley take the blame. "Not specifically, sir."

Snape's eyes narrowed. "Explain."

"Well... I don't know why anyone might have attacked Tracey specifically. If it's a Slytherin behind the attacks though... well, attacking another Slytherin might pin the blame on different house."

"A... very well-reasoned hypothesis," Snape said after a time. "Do you have any other brilliant suggestions to narrow down the field of suspects?" Harry shook his head. "Very well," said Snape.

Harry expected to be dismissed, but Snape did not immediately grant him leave. "I am aware that you were present the night Neville Longbottom met his demise."

Harry felt as though somebody had injected icy water straight into his veins. It seemed to flow through him and cool his blood by twenty degrees.

"Do calm down," Snape continued, "I have no intention of spreading the fact to the public." He sneered. "If you fear my suspicion, I think your involvement in Longbottom's death about as likely as your involvement in this fiasco. Which, for your information, I deem to be about as possible as either of your parents rising up from their graves."

"Then why are you questioning me, sir?" Harry wasn't sure what made him ask the question. It was bold and probably foolish, but it sprang to his tongue and he could not help but part his lips and allow it to flow free.

Snape's lip curled. "Because as much as I often despise the fact, my job description necessitates I do more than brew potions in this dungeon and pretend that the insufferable occupants of this castle do not exist." The man's expression hardened. "If you plan to ask why I am making a point of informing you of all I know, it is because I wish to warn you, Potter. Rushing headlong into every situation will get you killed much faster than your hair-brained father." There was a pause during which Snape seemed to wait for a reaction, but Harry did not grant him one. "And when you put yourself into situations which make it *look* as though you have done so, you may see yourself on the wrong side of a prison cell door faster than your good-for-nothing godfather."

***November 29, 1992***

***A Balcony Overlooking the Hogwarts Grounds***

***4:34 PM***

The past twenty-four hours had been the most trying of the year for Harry. He had dealt with the scorn of the Gryffindors ever since Colin Creevey had turned up petrified, but this was an entirely new level.

News of his absence from the common room around the time of the attack on Tracey had somehow spread throughout the school. Harry wasn't sure who exactly had snitched, but he supposed it didn't really matter. There were a whole myriad of upper year students who would gladly have spread the news around in hopes that his life would become a living hell.

There was a significant portion of the school that had been skeptical of his involvement before Tracey went missing, but now many of them seemed convinced that Harry's innocence was merely a facade. He already missed the days when he could walk through the corridors unaccosted, but he now found himself missing the days when the only spells flung towards him were ones without intent to cause long-term harm.

It was all quite exhausting, and that was to say nothing of what was going on inside of Slytherin House.

Daphne had not spoken a word all day. The usually outgoing girl seemed to have drawn into herself. She had even been quiet all throughout classes. Harry wanted to talk to her, but he had no idea how. He liked Tracey and was disappointed she had been attacked, but Daphne was much closer to her. Harry had never had a friend that close, so he had no idea how it must feel. Blaise was as stoic as ever whilst Millicent and Lillian seemed to be in similar headspaces to Daphne.

Classes had just wrapped up and Harry had practically fled from the common room. The tense dynamic was driving him mad and he needed some air after the day he had been having.

He donned his invisibility cloak and slipped through the hall unimpeded. It was a nice feeling to avoid the spells for the first time in weeks, though he had to move slowly. He couldn't risk bumping into anyone --- the cloak was the most useful tool he had in his admittedly limited arsenal. The last thing he wanted was for someone to discover he had the tool in the first place. That would only mean the tool would become much less practical for him to use.

His feet carried him through a hidden passage and up a set of stairs concealed behind an ancient tapestry. He had put no thought into the matter, but he was standing atop the same balcony he had spoken with Diana several times.

The already cloudy sky was growing darker far above. It seemed as though a dark cloud of grey was spreading outwards and consuming the light of the sky. Harry felt something wet run down his face and nearly jumped before he realized what it was. The first snowfall of the year had arrived in the Scottish highlands. The flakes fell slowly, but they were thick and seemed like a white veil as they fell. Harry knew that that next morning he would wake to at least a light dusting of snow painting the grass white, even if it didn't last.

"I've always liked snow."

Some time ago, Harry might have jumped, but he was becoming much more comfortable with other people and much harder to scare. "How is it we always seem to end up talking up here?"

Diana laughed lightly as she stepped up beside him and peered down at the grounds sprawled out far below. "Because we're both human beings who need breaks. It just so happens that we like to take them in the same place."

Harry snorted. "It was either this or go and explore the castle."

"You do that a lot, don't you?"

He shrugged. "More during the last few weeks, but yeah. It's a hobby of mine."

"I imagine *that* makes it easy." Harry wondered what she meant for a moment before she gestured to the silvery cloak pooled at his feet.

Oh... bollocks!

He had been so careful whilst moving through the halls, only to allow the cloak to slide off of him and lay at his feet and in plain sight. He had become so distracted by the scenery that he had allowed his concentration to lapse. This was bad. He hadn't even told Draco about the cloak during the peak of their friendship. He wanted to trust Diana --- she seemed the most trustworthy person he had met so far in the magical world --- but he was unsure if he could.

*"The Malfoys might view you as a tool, but that doesn't mean all of us do."*

Harry needed to get to the bottom of his situation with the Malfoys. He had decided by now that Lucius had probably been manipulating him and Draco, but what of Diana and Narcissa? He wanted to trust both of them, but he wasn't sure he could. It was something he needed to figure out at some point in the near future. Living with the uncertainty was not only massively inconvenient, it was also exceedingly stressful.

"Don't worry," said Diana, looking at him closely. Harry realized some of his inner conflict must have shown on his face. Diana had clearly interpreted it as him being worried about the cloak. She wasn't wrong, he supposed, she was just less right than she suspected. "I won't tell anyone about the cloak. This explains a lot, actually. How you seem to know the castle better than almost anyone I know, how you just slip away sometimes, how you manage to come back to the common room ages after curfew without being caught." Her eyes drifted back down towards the cloak. "May I ask where you got it?"

"It was my father's," Harry answered. He supposed that there was really no point in lying now. If Diana knew he had it, it hardly mattered if she knew how he had come by the cloak in the first place. He would leave out the bit about Dumbledore sending it to him, but the rest...

Diana was looking at him strangely. "It was... your father's?" He nodded. "Harry... invisibility cloaks aren't supposed---"

"Aren't supposed to last for more than five or so years? Yeah, I know; I looked them up in the library ages ago. I don't get it either, but the cloak is perfect. It's never not worked the way it's supposed to."

Better than it was supposed to, maybe. He thought back to the way Voldemort had tried to detect him and failed until he had blown off Harry's cloak with some sort of magical wind. Whether invisibility cloaks were supposed to prevent detection charms from working or not, Harry had no idea. If they weren't... well, that only added to the mystery and it was at least one ace he could keep up his sleeve for a little bit longer.

"I've never heard of anything like it," Diana admitted. "I've heard of especially powerful cloaks lasting close to a decade, but if that was your father's... it's at least **twelve-**years-old."

"It's definitely older. He had it while he was at Hogwarts. It's at least fifteen-years-old, I'd say."

"That shouldn't be possible." Diana's fingers were drumming rhythmically on the balcony's railing as she stared up into the steadily darkening sky. Flakes of snow were nestling themselves in her long blonde hair, but she seemed to neither notice nor care.

Harry had not put a great deal of thought into his cloak as of late. It had been a mystery he had spent some time researching in his first year, but that had been before he had been traumatized by the collective efforts of two dark lords. He had been a touch distracted ever since.

It actually sounded like an interesting project to distract himself with again, though he knew it would require him to sneak into the Restricted Section. This time, he would be much more careful not to anger any of the books that could scream so loud it made his eardrums want to burst. Finding the Mirror of Erised had been interesting, but he did not cherish the idea of sprinting through the halls to escape the horrible screams again. He wondered what happened to the mirror after Neville's death, but he quickly made up his mind to move on.

*"It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live,\"* Dumbledore had said. They were words Harry was taking seriously. If he didn't, he might well and truly be mad by now.

Diana shook her head slowly as if to clear it. "I guess the cloak doesn't really matter. It's just... strange. Anyway, how are you handling everything?"

"I'm handling it," said Harry. "It's really just more of the same. The curses are more brutal and there are more of them, but it's the same thing I've been dealing with ever since Creevey got attacked."

"Is it still mostly the Gryffindors?"

"Mostly, but there are some Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws, too. No Slytherins in public, obviously, but some of the upper years would still love to curse me in the back. They probably would if not for Daphne and maybe my spot on the Quidditch team."

"They would still curse you even with you being on the team," said Diana. "They would just make sure their spell was reversed before the next match."

Harry laughed despite himself. It was a painfully apt description of the house of cunning. "Lovely. Well, here's to hoping none of them actually try it."

"Just spend more time under that cloak. If I had one of those, I'd probably spend most of the day under it. I've been meaning to try and learn the Disillusionment Charm, but it's not as solid as an actual invisibility cloak."

Harry tilted his head. "The... what charm?"

"Disillusionment Charm. It's a sort of camouflage spell. It lets you blend in so seamlessly with your surroundings that if you're standing still, you might as well be invisible."

* "If you will forgive my lack of modesty for a moment, I do not need a cloak to become invisible."*

Harry wondered whether or not this had been the spell Dumbledore had cast over himself that night or whether he had used something completely different. If it was this, he had exaggerated things. The spell seemed useful, but it was far from true, unimpeded invisibility. Harry would be sticking to his cloak for the foreseeable future.

"Maybe I'll take your advice on that," he said thoughtfully. Spending more of his day invisible really didn't sound unappealing. "I'm all right, though. I just needed a bit of air."

Diana smiled. "It does help, doesn't it?" She looked back towards the castle. "Have you had enough of it?" Harry nodded and followed her back inside.

***The Dungeons***

***9:09 AM***

Harry had taken Diana's advice and spent much of the day hidden under the cloak. Daphne was still strangely distant with him, so he had felt no real need to spend much time with the group. He'd spent the week wandering the castle and exploring the Restricted Section. He had yet to find any explanation regarding his cloak, but he had found a number of interesting tomes that contained spells the likes of which he had never imagined before. Some he had seen in some of the more recent memories Grindelwald was feeding him. He had been witnessing his first few years at Durmstrang recently and near the end of his second year, Grindelwald had begun looking into some... interesting bits of magic.

Today was the final day of classes for the week and the Slytherins and Gryffindors were congregated outside the Potions Classroom, waiting. Weasley was conversing in a low voice with Granger, but Harry could see Draco making his way towards them and knew things could get ugly fast.

"Drop the act, Weasley," drawled Draco. "Why bother pretending that you don't know who the Heir is? You're embarrassing yourself."

Weasley's face turned red as a fierce blush rose up his cheeks. "Stuff it, Malfoy. I know you and the rest of your group of gits were the ones who came up with that stupid song."

Draco staggered back, clasping his chest as though it had been pierced by a dagger. "Don't you like it, Weasley? We all spent so much time making sure it was perfect. I can try and make it better, if you'd like? Anything for a man doing good and honest work." He sneered at Granger. "I'll let you write the thing yourself if I don't have to see her stupid teeth any time---"

Draco's sentence was cut off when Weasley flung himself forward. Draco reached for his wand, but Weasley was on top of him before he could draw it. Crabbe and Goyle stepped forward to take hold of Weasley, but Thomas and Finnigan had drawn their wands. Harry gripped his, but hesitated. He remembered the Cutting Curse he'd struck Weasley with earlier in the year. The problem was that he also remembered the numerous nights he had spent in detention with the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor as the man tried and failed to goad Harry into killing the lamb each night. Every time his wand would raise, he would remember the horrible voice he'd heard inside his own head that first night and the way it had screamed for blood.

A spell blasted Weasley and Draco apart. They went rolling away from each other with each of their robes having been ruffled. Weasley was the first to his feet. Blood was trickling from his nose as he glared hatefully towards Draco, whose lip was split and who looked every bit as livid.

"What is going on here?"

Everyone looked around to see the very unimpressed visage of Professor Snape as he glared at the lot of them.

"Weasley attacked me, sir," said Draco.

"You bloody---"

"Ten points from Gryffindor, Weasley." Snape waved his wand twice and healed both boys' injuries. "Now, everyone, inside. Despite your exhaustive efforts to disrupt each and every single one of your peers, there is still a class to attend."

As they all stepped inside the room, Harry couldn't help but notice that the way Weasley and Granger whispered back and forth seemed much more animated than it had been before. What was even stranger were the odd glances that Granger occasionally threw in his direction before flicking her eyes towards Draco and then averting her stare altogether.

***December 7, 1992***

***The Great Hall***

***8:37 AM***

Snow had officially taken up its annual residency upon the grounds of Hogwarts. The ground was solid and it gleamed with the sparkle of the white powder that coated it. It was a bright and sunny day and the rays of sun shining down from the ceiling high above sparkled off of the plates and made the spoons, forks, and knives glitter like strangely shaped gemstones.

Harry wanted to glare up at the sky for daring to mock him. Many around the hall were in high spirits, but not Harry. Today was the day the heads of house went around to their pupils and collected the names of everyone who would be staying at Hogwarts over the winter holidays. It was a reminder for many that soon they would be back home with their families. For Harry, it was a reminder that the blasted Dursleys still lorded power over him. Lucius Malfoy had promised him during the summer that would change, but he had heard nothing on that front. Perhaps it had been another one of the manipulations Daphne had accused him of.

He glanced towards Daphne now, but little had changed since Tracey's petrification. She seemed to speak only when spoken to. The charisma that seemed to ooze from her at all hours of the day appeared to have dried up or else leaked out of her. It was still odd seeing her this way and Harry didn't like it, but he did not dare get involved in this mess. Not after how poorly his first year had ended when he had tried to do too much.

Vast, dense clouds temporarily blocked the sunlight as hundreds of owls streamed into the hall with the morning's post. Hedwig was easily visible among them since she shone every bit as white as the snow outside.

She greeted Harry with a hoot when she landed in front of him. She nipped his finger briefly before fixing her beady eyes intently on a plate of bacon not far down the table. Harry allowed his lips to curve upwards as he snatched a piece and fed it to his bird. He glanced down at his bit of mail and saw that it was from Narcissa. He would read it later, he decided. Their letters had become more personal. The last thing he wanted was some older Slytherin to see what it was they were writing about. They take it for a weakness. If they did, they might be stupid enough to think they could use it against him.

Harry turned back towards his cup of pumpkin juice only to find that someone had taken it. Hardly surprising, he supposed. It had still been full and he had become distracted. Some older Slytherin had probably just swiped it on their way past. It was likely that they hadn't even realized who it was they were taking it from.

"Here, Harry, take this one." It was strange to hear Daphne talk so willingly. It had happened so scarcely that Harry was startled for half a heartbeat before he reached out and took the glass of pumpkin juice from her.

"Thanks, Daph---"

His eyes widened as his hand almost went slack. It took a conscious effort to keep a hold on the glass as he peered down at it as though it was some kind of artifact that had fallen from outer space.

He cast his eyes numbly from the glass in his hands to the chain that hung about his neck --- the very chain that Regulus Black had given him for his twelfth birthday... the chain that had heated up and that was glowing a faint red colour.

*"So long as you're wearing it, it will detect any poisons before you drink. It's never been known to be wrong and it's not stingy about what it classifies as a poison. If it can cause you harm, the chain will warn you."*

Shock washed over Harry.

Poison?! Daphne had tried to poison him?!

It had to be Daphne. She had handed him the cup and she had already proven herself more than capable of it in the past.

But... why?

Complete and total disbelief clung to Harry like perspiration as he stared towards Daphne and met her eyes. Her expression was blank as she looked back at him, her eyes devoid of any and all emotion.

The fingers Harry had wrapped around the glass began to tremble. He had been so sure he'd found a friend in Daphne, and then this of all things had happened. Was he destined to never have a friend? Dudley had seen to that whilst he lived on Privet Drive, but even in the magical world, he had known nothing but betrayal.

No, he thought, that wasn't true; he was making things out to be a touch worse than they were. Diana had never betrayed him... or had she?

The plates and goblets around Harry began to shake as though a tremor had run through the rock cliff that the castle sat atop. Harry knew he would explode if he stayed. The shock was beginning to wane now and give way to other emotions. There was so much hurt, anger, and betrayal rising up within him that he wasn't sure he wouldn't use the Cutting Curse again... or worse --- he had learned worse since. Yet if he did this time... he wasn't sure his aim would be to create a simple cut.

If Harry sat in a chair instead of resting upon the wooden benches all students occupied, the force with which he stood would have sent it careening backwards. As it was, he was on his feet and storming out the door as a red sort of haze seemed to cloud his vision as a similar-coloured tinge of anger seemed to touch every inch of his skin as he began to shake. He hardly noticed that he was still holding the goblet in his hand, though he noticed her stare. He felt it as he left the hall and knew without turning around that Daphne had not taken her eyes off of him since Harry had laid a hand on the goblet.

***Durmstrang Institute***

***8:44 PM***

Gellert absentmindedly cast yet another Warming Charm as he glanced back down at the sheet of parchment he held. He was seated in his years' barracks, located in one of the castle's many towers. The tower itself was made from rough grey stone, but the wind had weathered the walls over time, smoothing over harsh, jutting edges. It seemed as though the rock had thinned, for the biting cold managed to seep through cracks and permeate the air inside. There had been a period of time during his first year when Gellert had spent hours each day huddled under the thin and ragged blanket the school provided, but those days had passed the second the Warming Charm had become nearly as instinctual to him as breathing.

There were no windows in the barracks, but he could hear the wind whistling outside and picture the snow blowing in pale drifts across the expansive grounds. Sometimes, the wind kicked up so much of it that it appeared like a shimmering white fog.

He glanced back down at the parchments and read once more. He was nearly through his third year at Durmstrang and things were about to change.

*Herr Grindelwald,*

*Congratulations on completing your first three years at Durmstrang Institute. Fourth-year students enter into an altered, more specialized curriculum with branching classes for each of the major subjects. You may take as many classes as you would like. Attendance at every class is not mandatory, but please note that it is the responsibility of the student to keep their in-class performance at an acceptable standard. It is not the obligation of the professor to ensure students keep up to date in their classes.*

*Please send in your choices by the end of this school year.*

*Regards,*

*Ilyn Shevchenko*

*Highmaster*

Gellert's eyes gleamed as they scanned over some of his potential options. He was already taking a few of them, having tested ahead in several of his classes, but he had been limited in which branches of magic the school would allow him to study before the end of his third year.

Now though... Now he was free. Not only could he choose his standard electives, but he would be able to test out of less challenging classes more freely and pursue the magic he was most interested in.

Now was when the true beginning of his education would arrive and when he would start taking real strides for the first time.

All the cold that had filled him to the brim was gone now. It had been purged from his body by the warm glow of excitement and anticipation. It had consumed the cold as though it was little more than a well-prepared pyre laid bare before an open flame.

This was what being a wizard was really about. It was all of this that made all those years in the muggle world worth it. It was all of this that made the hell they had put him through worth it. It was all of this that might one day allow him to set everything right.

Harry barely even flinched anymore after being exposed to another of Grindelwald's memories. Ever since he had witnessed his arrival at Durmstrang, the memories had drastically increased in regularity. He had lived through much of Grindelwald's first three years of school. Not through every class, but he saw the significant events. He had seen him jump a year ahead in his Dark Arts class from the onset and now that his electives had opened up, Harry was sure Grindelwald would skip yet another year. The boy was nearly as talented in Transfiguration as he was in the Dark Arts. Watching his work made Harry realize he needed to put more time into that branch of magic himself. He had grown this year by leaps and bounds in his combat ability, but he needed to make sure he progressed at the same rate in other classes.

In a strange way, the memories were helping with that. He may not have been sitting through the classes with Grindelwald, but he did see him work from time to time. There had been some transfigurations Harry had never seen before that he now at least knew the incantation, wand movement, and necessary process for. Whether he could perform them or not remained to be seen, but he had the necessary pieces.

And curses... he had picked up a startling number of curses.

Grindelwald had made few friends at Durmstrang so far, but he was revered by some of the students in his Dark Arts class. They may have been a year older, but it was clear who the top student was. Many of them flocked to Grindelwald and the boy had taken full advantage of it. He and his companions had worked with some older students to arrange for a sort of duelling circuit at the school outside of classes. It took place out on the grounds in the dead of night and was brutal. Durmstrang in general was lax in terms of enforcing its rules, but these duels... the only rule, as far as Harry could tell, was to avoid killing each other if at all possible.

Harry had found himself wishing more than once he had gone to Durmstrang. Hogwarts was his first home and any time he really thought about it, he knew he wouldn't trade the ancient castle for anything, but by Merlin did Durmstrang have its merits.

The curriculum was demanding, but the way they encouraged excellence and allowed students to test ahead... it was something he thought would have been a boon to him. It would almost certainly have sped him along in the wanded subjects even more so than he was already. He wished Hogwarts taught like Durmstrang every time he watched the memories. He had seen through the dreams that many students failed to keep up with the classes and ended up dropping out of the school altogether, but Harry wouldn't have cared. If students couldn't keep up, that was their own problem. It wasn't something he would ever have to worry about, so he wouldn't have been troubled by such things.

He ran a hand through his hair as he sat up in bed. He wondered for what must have been the thousandth time why Grindelwald was showing him all of this. He suspected there was a motive, yet nothing seemed fabricated. Everything Harry had been shown seemed authentic and he wondered what the former dark lord was playing at. Perhaps to turn him against muggles and sway Harry towards his cause?

If that was his goal... was it working?

Harry shook his head --- it was best not to think about such things. He could instinctually tell that the time at which he normally rose was drawing near, so he stood from his bed and reached for his clothes. Better to get an early start on the day than to wallow in thoughts that worried him more than any others.

***December 11, 1992***

***The Out of Order Girls' Bathroom on the Second Floor***

***6:56 PM***

Ron wrinkled his nose the second Hermione led him across the bathroom's threshold. It had been out of order for a great deal of time and did not suffer from the kind of stench one might expect. Instead, moisture floated thickly in the air --- like it had polluted the place instead of the foulness of human waste.

The lower portions of the walls looked weathered and as though they had bore the brunt of a hundred mighty storms. The room smelled of mold and algae; Ron had no doubt he would find it growing in the cracks on the walls if he cared to look. A thin sheet of water blanketed the floor. It was as undisturbed as the smooth surface of a lake on a warm summer's day until the two second-year Gryffindors stepped into the room and sent ripples cascading through the shallow layer of water.

"Bloody hell," cursed Ron. "Hermione, why in Merlin's name would you take me here? We have the Knight's Room, and... this is a *girl's* bathroom." The Knight's Room was what their little practice group had taken to calling the room hidden behind the suit of armour that they all used to practice and meet up. "This place is a ruin."

"Which is exactly why no one will think to check it." Hermione wrinkled her nose. "Well... that and Moaning Myrtle."

"Come again?"

"She's a horrible ghost. She spends most of her time shrieking like she's died again --- I've never seen anyone so miserable. She haunts this bathroom, but she sometimes floats down into some of the others. It's an awful scare any time Myrtle just floats in and starts wailing."

"Right," said Ron. "Remind me why we're here again? Nobody's ever found us in the Knight's Room."

"You told me that you thought Malfoy might be behind the petrifications, remember?"

Ron's expression darkened. "Yeah, I do. The git's been trying to blame me all year and he was the first to go shouting off about it when Mrs. Norris showed up petrified. Same thing when Colin was attacked."

"Exactly," said Hermione. "I don't disagree with you, like I said, but the problem is proving it. Nobody is just going to expel the son of Lucius Malfoy without proof."

"I get it, but what does this place have to do with proving Malfoy's going around petrifying people?"

"You remember earlier today when I asked you to make a distraction in Potions so I could grab a few things?" Ron nodded. "Well, I was doing that because I found out a way for us to work out if Malfoy's up to something." She bit her bottom lip and seemed all of a sudden reluctant to meet Ron's eyes. "It's... risky and against the rules. If we get caught, we'll be in horrible trouble---"

"Oh, get to the point."

Hermione huffed. "Fine. The point is that I found a recipe for a potion that might help. It's called Polyjuice Potion."

Ron's eyes went so wide one might think they were fit to burst from their sockets. "Polyjuice Potion? You're sure?" She nodded. "Blimey, that's supposed to be super complicated. Rare, too, and\... well, really expensive."

"It is," Hermione admitted meekly.

A wave of raw reality slammed into Ron with the force of a cyclone. "Hold on, Hermione, where the hell did you find a recipe for Polyjuice Potion? It's really illegal, Percy's said as much loads of times; I doubt anyone would just leave it lying around."

Her cheeks flushed so red that Ron thought they were beginning to resemble his Quidditch jersey. She was looking anywhere but at him and he was all at once certain she was hiding something.

"I don't know," she finally answered. "I just... did."

She wasn't going to provide him with any more clarity on the matter; Ron was certain of that much, at least. "Fine," he said. "How do you plan to make Polyjuice? The ingredients are supposed to be really rare and---"

Hermione reached into her pockets and withdrew a number of vials, cutting Ron short. "We're at Hogwarts, Ron. I doubt there's a larger store of potion ingredients anywhere in Britain other than some of the top apothecaries. I wasn't sure Professor Snape would have all of the ingredients, but he did. This might be the only place in the country where I could find all of them."

Something in the back of Ron's mind was nudging at him. It was whispering things to him, singing about exactly how convenient this all was. It really did seem too easy and it bordered on unnatural, but Ron decided to let it go. After the nightmares that had befallen them last year and the horrors of this one so far, he supposed the world had just finally decided it owed the both of them a break.

***December 12, 1992***

***Aberforth Dumbledore's Office***

***9:37 PM***

Harry stared blankly at the lamb lying before him. He would have grown bored long ago had waves of frustration not been crashing inside of him since the moment he'd stepped foot in the room. It happened every time he had one of these detentions. Frustration, anger, bitterness, loathing --- it all boiled up inside of him and threatened to spew forth in one vicious bout every time he felt his restraint begin to waver.

This detention had been like many others, but worse. Just like all that had come before it, Harry had entered the room, curtly greeted Aberforth, turned towards the lamb, and refused to do anything whilst the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor marked essays or did whatever the hell the old codger was doing whilst Harry stared dully at a lamb.

What had made this night more agonizing was the fact that all of the negative feelings were so much stronger. He had been in a piss-poor mood ever since Daphne had tried to poison him. Harry had made it back to the dormitory that morning before he'd realized he was still holding the poisoned glass of pumpkin juice. He had poured it into potion vials and hid them in his trunk. He still wasn't entirely sure he wouldn't take them to Professor Snape for examination, but he didn't trust the man in the slightest. Had that fact been untrue, he might well have marched to the man's office that very morning.

He had hidden under the cloak for most of the time since and spent a vast majority of it in the library. The Restricted Section, in particular, had been where he had dwelled most often whilst he wallowed in this most recent betrayal.

Harry was really getting sick of people doing that. First it had been his own family. They were supposed to care for him, yet they had abused and neglected Harry ever since he was a child. All of his teachers growing up were no better. If he were to count them, he would be sitting in this old goat's office all night. He'd thought he had finally made friends when his first year at Hogwarts had commenced, but he had been proven mostly wrong once again. Draco had betrayed him not once, but twice. Theodore still occasionally snuck into the library to catch up with Harry, but he was the only one in his old group of friends who did. He had caught Pansy stealing sad glances towards him on more days than not, but they meant nothing without action.

Daphne had been the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel of darkness and despair he'd trudged through after his relationship with Draco had crumbled. She had helped him in Potions, been someone he was genuinely fond of, welcomed him into an enjoyable group of friends, protected him from the upper years via her name alone, and even led him to realize what at least one of the Malfoys had likely been doing all along. She had even taken revenge on Darren Travers for him. It had been nothing but a long string of positive experiences with Daphne... until Tracey had gone missing.

She had been quiet and withdrawn after that, but Harry had thought it was natural. Daphne was the most intelligent person he had ever met and he had assumed she was quietly calculating exactly who was behind everything, or else how best to strike back at them, or maybe even both. He had expected anything along those lines and maybe even something different.

What he had not expected was for her to slip him a goblet full of poison. Exactly what was in the pumpkin juice, he still had no idea. A part of him didn't want to find out. She had betrayed him and irrevocably shattered the trust they'd once had. It didn't matter how badly she had betrayed him; it was the principle that mattered.

He had isolated himself alongside his sorrow and misery ever since and it had not helped his mood. He could feel that tonight, his patience was thinner than the frail sheet of ice that was beginning to creep its way across the surface of the great Black Lake.

He heard the rustling of parchment from behind him. It sounded like a long cloak brushing against fallen autumn leaves. He turned; usually, Aberforth did not so much as look up from his work until the hour had grown late and curfew had long-since passed.

The professor was looking at him. Perhaps Harry should have averted his eyes, but he met the old man's stare with steadfast spite. "Sir?"

Aberforth snorted. "Don't sir me, boy." He glanced about the room before letting his stare find Harry once more. "We've been at this long enough. The both of us know you're capable of killing the thing. Get it over with, will you? I'm tired of this; it's lasted long enough."

Harry felt as though he had just fallen and smacked his head against the floor. The words of his professor reached him, but it was as though they were distorted and came from far away. He was having a difficult time processing exactly what the words meant.

"Sir, I don't---"

"Don't tell me you don't understand." Aberforth's expression was as hard and unyielding as unforged iron. "What's the matter, boy? You'll petrify a cat but you won't attack a lamb?"

Pain seemed to flare into being inside Harry's chest. It was like someone had stabbed him in the heart with a dagger and then lit it ablaze and let the flames spread outwards, burning through muscle and flesh with no regard as they went.

The fire appeared to have risen to his eyes --- that same, reddish haze that had been present after Daphne had tried to poison him was tinging the corners of his vision.

"Sir," Harry said, using his limited Occlumency the best he could to keep all emotions in check, "I never petrified Mrs. Norris."

"Of course not. The same way you definitely didn't attack the boy who was harassing you hours before he went missing."

Harry couldn't believe what he was hearing. "So what then, Professor?" His voice dripped with venom as he hurled Aberforth's title at him as if it was a poisoned arrow. "Do you think I attacked one of my best friends right after?"

The professor's answer was a shrug. "Good way to throw everyone off your trail." He leant forward and seemed to watch Harry closely. "I also don't see you hanging about with Greengrass and her posse anymore. Might be that they think the same as me."

Harry almost staggered. The blow was more impactful than any physical spell ever could have been.

Was that why Daphne had tried to poison him? Did she think he had attacked Tracey? How the hell could she ever believe he had attacked Tracey? And this man? Albus Dumbledore's brother --- the man who had been tormenting Harry with these sick, twisted detentions for months? He was so sick of them, so sick of it, so sick of everything.

He had just enough restraint left to spin on his heel before the curse formed fully on his tongue and his wand took aim at Aberforth. The old prick would have made for a more satisfying target, but it also would have caused many more problems.

"Lacero!"

A jagged jet of purple light careened from the tip of Harry's wand. It was a dark curse according to many people and Harry had never cast it before. He had seen Grindelwald use it in duels at Durmstrang to great effect after learning it in a book in the school's library. Harry had tracked down the same book in English in the Hogwarts library and studied the spell for himself. He had never imagined he would be using it so soon.

The lamb had not been looking at Harry, but it must have sensed the reaper's fingers stretching out towards it, for it looked up at the last possible second with wide and innocent eyes. They were a deep brown colour that practically cried of kindness and love. They reminded Harry so painful of Longbottom's panicked eyes in that corridor last June. Harry wondered if Aberforth had made sure the creature was as innocent-looking as he possibly could. It seemed exactly the sort of sadistic trick the man would play.

The majestic scene of innocence was ruined not a second later when the spell found its mark. Harry's aim was true and the lamb was halfway through a long and curious bleat when the purple light found its target. The sound escaping from its mouth became raspy and choked as Harry's spell tore through wool, skin, flesh, and bone. The choked, gurgling sound that had become the creature's final lament was cut short by a dull thud as its severed head hit the floor and rolled to lay unmoving at Harry's feet.

Its eyes were still open, but the warmth and colour was gone. They were like glass now and Harry could not help but think of how the creature was now broken. He thought it a mockery; nothing so broken should have eyes so smooth and whole, even if they were lifeless. He thought it would have been more apt if they had resembled a shattered sheet of glass, but the sight did not hold his attention long.

His gaze fell upon the lamb's body and his heart nearly skipped a beat. Something about it was sickly familiar. It made bile rise in the back of his throat, but he knew it would not come up. He felt like Grindelwald had felt in his dream all those years ago while the smoke rose up in great plumes all around him. Every muscle in his throat seemed to have contracted. The last thing it appeared to desire was air. Perhaps karma truly was real, Harry thought. Maybe this was the world starving him of oxygen for killing something so pure and defenceless.

Blood was running from the gaping chasm where the creature's head had once rested. It was flowing fast in all directions. It was stretching out this way and that like a crimson web of woven silk or cracked rock spreading outwards as more and more of its surface gave way. Much of the blood was flowing onto the stone floor. The grey rock was darkening rapidly. It was as though the blood was a dark-red dye meant to add some flavour to the dull grey stone.

None of that held Harry's attention.

What held him captive was the blood that flowed in the other direction.

It ran swiftly over the creature's woollen coat. The red was so vivid against the pale wool that Harry could see every droplet as it flowed across its surface. The imagery was familiar. He had seen something similar once through the eyes of another. The day Wylla Nurmen had been put to death... the way her blood had stained the pale white snow. It was the same here. It was too much the same... it made Harry want to gag and vomit but his throat would not allow it.

"Got there in the end, didn't we?" Harry whirled to face the professor. He was no longer seeing red. He felt nothing at all as he turned, which was dangerous. If the anger returned to him, he wasn't sure he would have the restraint necessary to not curse this monster of a man. Yet he somehow knew anger would not rise --- not yet. That would come soon but for now, there was nothing. "Three bloody months we spent at this," the man grumbled. "If I knew all it would take was some goading, I'd have done it ages ago."

Harry had been wrong --- the anger was there. It was rising again and he was shaking. This man had accused him of attacking one of his best friends and made him question everything just to goad him into firing that damned curse?

Harry spun and made for the door, but the professor's voice called after him. "Not yet, Potter; I haven't told you to leave. Walk out now and you'll be in this room every Saturday until the day I die." Harry took a deep breath and exerted every bit of his Occlumency to keep himself calm as he turned. Even so, he was still shaking.

"It doesn't feel nice, does it?" asked Aberforth. "That was a lamb, Potter. Now imagine if that curse had hit a boy." He left the obvious unsaid. "However awful you feel now, it would be a hundred times worse. There are consequences to your actions and you need to consider them. Next time you want to curse a fellow student, think about how it felt when that spell tore through the lamb's throat. Maybe that will give you pause." The man's face was impassive as he asked his next question. "Where exactly did you learn that spell?"

"In a book." Aberforth continued to watch him closely for a moment before nodding towards the door. Harry left at once. Perhaps the man thought he was shaking from the horror of what he had just done, but Harry knew it was from anger.

He had been disturbed for a moment. When the image had been so reminiscent of Wylla Nurmen's death... it had disturbed him. But when anger had taken over, that image meant something different --- something terrifying.

Harry had not felt horror at killing the lamb. Until he had imagined Wylla's blood, it hadn't even bothered him. And once he had and put thought into it, he realized her blood did not make him regret speaking the incantation and moving his wand. It simply made him furious that no one had done the same thing to every single person who had thrown a stone that winter's day all those years ago.

Harry's legs were still shaking by the time the wall parted and admitted him back into the Slytherin common room. After all that had just happened, he almost expected there to be another attack. It would be so typical for everything to happen all at once. Naturally, he would somehow be blamed again, which at this point might lead him to become homicidal.

Looking at Daphne might have given that same feeling cause to arise, so he avoided doing that. It had become a habit since the attempted poisoning, but he looked at nobody as he crossed the common room, his eyes staring unblinkingly at the dark tunnel leading to the dormitories on the room's other side. The air was no more tense than usual, so Harry took comfort in the fact that the stress of the night was at its end. Except for dreams, he supposed... that might well prove to be another matter altogether.

"Harry! Watch out!"

He reacted instinctively. Pansy's voice sounded through the room and he didn't think twice. He threw himself forward and to the floor. With his head down, he didn't see the spell miss him, but he could hear it crackling through the air. He rolled and avoided another spell as he took to his feet. His eyes widened when he saw the third. It was the same spell that he had just used on the lamb... and it was aimed at his chest.

Harry hardly realized he was moving as he sidestepped the curse and slid his wand into his hand. He was too lost to the haze of red that had not entirely receded by the time he had entered the common room. There was a small part of him that realized he could suppress the pent-up wave of fury, stress, frustration, and whatever the hell else he was dealing with. Or, keep it at bay, at the very least, but he made yet another decision that he would later look back upon with a great deal of uncertainty.

He chose to let it rule him. It flowed through every part of him and filled him like the warmth one experiences after a deep gulp of wine.

The spell sailed past him and Harry countered with a Stunner and a Cutting Curse. His opponent dodged the first and shielded the second. Only when he was forced to shield and pause momentarily beneath one of the magical spheres of light did Harry recognize him. His blond hair gleamed like ghostly fire in the magical light and his eyes seemed paler than usual.

It was Cadmus Yaxley, Cassie's younger brother.

If Harry was thinking more rationally, several things might have sprung to mind. The way the boy had seemed to wish him harm the last time they had been this close to each other, the fact that he probably shouldn't do too much harm to Cassie's younger brother, or even the fact that the Yaxleys were all renowned duellists and despite being a first year, Cadmus may be more trouble than Harry was anticipating.

He thought none of these things.

He thought almost nothing at all as he dodged, shielded, countered, and advanced. Yaxley's eyes had gleamed with a malevolent sort of cruelty when the duel had begun, but they were dimming fast and growing wider and wider as spell after spell accosted him. They were coming with the frequency of rain drops caught up in a ruthless wind and hurled against the nearest set of walls. The boy was stumbling back under Harry's assault, clearly unprepared for the task before him. Harry felt a small amount of pleasure and amusement as the boy backed up. It was muted and trapped beneath everything else he was feeling, but he could only guess that the boy had suspected he would be easy prey for a Yaxley.

He was a good duellist, Harry had to admit. Cadmus was miles better than any first year had any right to be. He would have beaten Harry a year ago, he was sure, but time had passed and Harry had not been idle. Cadmus would likely have beaten any other second year, but Harry was not just a talented second year. If McGonagall and Flitwick were to be believed, he was much more than that and Cadmus was learning it first-hand whilst Harry enjoyed every second of it.

Duelling with Theodore, Draco, and the others had been fun in a way, but those exchanges had always been so light. Duelling with Cassie was riveting, but frustrating. This... this was different. There was no holding back, no honour code, and Harry wasn't duelling someone years older than him or whom he liked. He could take satisfaction at every inch of worry upon the boy's face without guilt as he rained spell after spell down upon him.

Yaxley lunged to the side and snarled as he fired a white spell towards Harry that he recognized at once, though only from seeing it in one of Grindelwald's memories. It was a spell that would leave the victim completely blind until the counter curse was cast, yet even that was not its true evil. It was said that the burning behind the eyes was so intense that those afflicted were known to rip their own eyes from their skulls.

And just like that, the duel was no longer fun. It was no longer a duel at all, but a fight, and Harry was going to use everything at his disposal --- secrets and consequences be damned. He was not thinking about what would happen if he resorted to the idea that had taken shape in his mind. He was not thinking about what it would mean or of what would stem from it. He would think later and perhaps regret, but for now, he saw only red and desired only victory.

As a jet of red light that Harry recognized as a Stunner flew near, he sidestepped and lashed out with his wand. His projected tendril of magic caught the stunner just as it came in range and sent it spinning back towards Yaxley. Spell deflection was something Harry had only pulled off a couple of times in practice with Cassie. It had been a risk to try it, but he knew it would lead to his victory if it worked, which was all that mattered.

Cadmus tried to dive out of the way of the spell, but Harry's Knockback Jinx caught him in mid-flight and sent him sailing through the air like a lost child's kite. His head slammed into the back of one of the couches near the fire and sent it toppling over on top of Yaxley, who struggled dazedly to get to his feet.

Harry's eyes were not fixed on the boy, but on the images etched so vividly into the sofa's leather. He squinted his eyes and tilted his head from side to side and suddenly, it was like every last depiction was moving.

**"Attack!"**

The couch came alive in a violent blur of motion as a sudden, unified hiss tore through what had been silence a moment before, yet it was drowned out by other noises that had replaced the quiet at the same time.

Screaming... half the room was screaming.

There were mutters, too, and jaws dropped so far they looked to be in danger of dislocating, but Harry paid no mind to any of them, though he heard and saw them all.

He advanced on Cadmus with his wand in hand. His expression was as blank as the common room's stone walls and it did not waver when several of the animated serpents coiled around the boy as others sank teeth into his arms, back, and shoulders.

"Enough!"

It was only because of months of conditioning and listening to that voice that Harry turned to face Cassie. Her cry alone had managed to reach him, though the haze had not yet cleared. Worry flickered at the corner of the haze for a moment. Had he gone too far? Had he ruined one of the only friendships he had left? The word *freak* seemed to hiss inside his head as he remembered the way Dudley told him he would never have a friend, but all those thoughts died when he met Cassie's eyes.

She did not look angry, just steadfast. "That's enough," she repeated. "He's had enough... you've made your point. Let it end."

Harry glanced from Cadmus, to Cassie, and back again. "I'm doing this for her," he said in a voice just loud enough for the boy to hear. **"Rest."** The snakes seemed to melt back into the couch all at once and become nothing more than depictions. Harry had crossed the room by the time the transformation had been made.

The room behind him was so quiet as he left it that every one of his footsteps echoed ominously against the floor as he went. No one moved to touch him, nor to check on his fallen victim. Harry found this odd for a moment before he realized why. As far as they all were concerned, no one dared attack the Heir of Slytherin.

***The Headmaster's Office***

***8:30 PM***

Daphne had never expected to find herself sitting across from the Headmaster in his office. If she planned to break any rules, she knew she was more than intelligent enough to avoid getting caught and she had never dreamed that she would ever take her concerns to Dumbledore of all people. Her father had never been fond of the man and he had his reasons.

Daphne hadn't anticipated much that had happened this year. She was usually excellent at predicting the actions of people and the situations evolving around her, but this year had proven to be a test and she had deduced what might be going on much too late.

"I must admit, Miss Greengrass, I was surprised to receive your correspondence."

*I bet you were,* Daphne thought. She had no doubt Dumbledore knew exactly what her family thought of him. Hopefully, that would mean that he understood going into this meeting exactly how severe the situation at hand really was.

"I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Headmaster," said Daphne, "but you were the only person who I felt comfortable bringing this to."

She thought she saw the corners of his lips twitch. He had obviously spotted the half-truth as easily as she had spoken it.

"I'm glad to hear it," said Dumbledore. "You were quite vague in your letter, though you did a marvellous job of professing the urgency with which you needed to speak to me. I am curious, Miss Greengrass, what is it that brings you to this enchanting room this evening?"

"It's about the Chamber of Secrets, sir. I think I might know who is behind it all."

"Do you now?" Dumbledore reached up and readjusted the half-moon spectacles resting upon his nose so that he could peer over the top of them at her with those deep, piercing eyes. "Tell me then, who is it you suspect of being the Heir of Slytherin?"

"Harry Potter."

"I see." Dumbledore's face had become expressionless the moment Daphne had uttered her first syllable and his voice gave away little more. "That is quite the accusation to lay at the feet of a fellow student. You seem quite a confident young woman with a mind as sharp as any who has ever walked these halls. Why is it that you are so confident in suspecting Harry of committing these crimes?"

Daphne bit her lower lip. "Sir... Headmaster. Anything I tell you... can you promise me that the fact I told you will never leave this room? No matter who asks you or what happens, can you promise that you'll never tell anyone that I'm the one who's told you this?"

Dumbledore tilted his head and studied her for a moment. The spectacles began to slip off his nose, so he reached up and righted them once more.

"You have my word as the headmaster of this school that anything you say will be taken in confidence and that if I see fit to share the information with any other, I shall do so without revealing your involvement in any way."

Daphne could see no flaw in the words and she was well-versed in finding them. "I'm not sure if you know, sir, but Potter and I became friends back in September. We started spending more time together as the year went on and once he had a falling out with Draco Malfoy and his group of friends." Dumbledore nodded to show that he was following along. "Well, one of my friends is Tracey Davis."

"Ah, I see. I must offer my condolences for her absence. She will be put to rights before the school year is at its end." He drummed his long fingers upon the surface of his desk. "May I ask how Harry treated Miss Davis?"

"He seemed to treat her well."

She could have lied but had seen no reason to do so. What she had to offer was more than enough to condemn Harry Potter as the Heir of Slytherin. She was only frustrated that she hadn't seen it sooner and that he had not drunk from the goblet... that would have made things so much easier. There would have been no need to prove anything; he would have confessed his guilt or innocence for the entire hall to hear. The fact she mourned for the loss of that opportunity more than she did for the waste of Veritaserum said a great deal about her confidence in the conclusion she had come to. Prodigious in the subject or not, that had not been a swift or simple potion to brew.

"That's not why I suspect him, though," Daphne went on. "Tracey... well, she's a muggleborn."

"I am aware of Miss Davis's blood status," Dumbledore said softly.

"Yes, well, I'm not sure if you're aware what it's like in Slytherin, Headmaster, but muggleborns don't exactly have an easy time of it. Tracey read up on Hogwarts and the wizarding world before coming and realized that her life would be hell if she didn't convince the house she was at least a halfblood."

"Did aligning with you not negate that?"

"She still got sneered at by some of the more elitist students, but most of them left her alone, especially once we became friends. Blood matters in Slytherin. Had she just come out and said she was a muggleborn, I'm not sure being friends with me would have helped her any."

The light that seemed to constantly twinkle in Dumbledore's eyes had been cast into sharp relief by the torch sitting upon his desk that Daphne assumed he had been using to aid him in reading. Nothing seemed to dance there now. The light seemed only to show her exactly how old the man really was. Every line of his face looked as though it had been etched deeper into the flesh in the seconds that had passed and she noticed for the first time exactly how old his silvery hair made him look.

"It saddens me to hear such tales," he said at last. "I have spent years since the downfall of Lord Voldemort wondering how best to mend the divide his tyranny caused within the school." He grimaced. "I must admit that I have been unable to come up with any worthy ideas. Each and every time I hear of tales such as this, it reminds me that I must find time in my schedule to devote to such things."

"So you understand why she was keeping it a secret, then?" Dumbledore nodded in a way so slowly and stiff that it looked as though every inch caused him unimaginable pain. "Well, someone must have figured it out. The Heir of Slytherin wants to rid the school of muggleborns --- that's what the old stories say, at least. If Tracey was attacked, it makes sense that the Heir figured out about her blood status."

"And you think that because Harry spent so much time with her, he was in an ideal position to deduce such truths?"

"Yes, but there's more than that. I'm not sure if you were told, but Harry was sent a package full of bubotuber pus."

"I am aware of the incident, yes."

"Well, Harry knew who it was right away. I confirmed it on my own later, but he knew from the beginning just by looking at him." She let her words hang in the air, hoping that Dumbledore would pick up on their meaning.

He was looking at her now in a way more calculating than he had before. "An interesting observation," he admitted. "Can I presume you believe that he used this same ability to deduce the truth about Miss Davis?"

Daphne nodded. "Yes, sir."

"I can understand why that may appear to you as though he might be in a position to strike," said Dumbledore. "My contention with your theory is that, for however talented Harry may be, I do not believe any second-year student capable of casting magic powerful enough to achieve what the Heir of Slytherin has thus far accomplished."

"Would it change your opinion if I told you that Potter has a power that hasn't been seen in Britain for years?"

Dumbledore raised an eyebrow. "And what power is this?"

"He's a Parselmouth. Last night in the common room, he animated some of the snakes on a couch just by hissing at them. They followed his every command and he set them loose on a first year. Cadmus Yaxley was his name. I'm sure he'll tell you if you question him yourself."

"I don't doubt you, Miss Greengrass," Dumbledore assured her. "I am unsurprised that Harry is a Parselmouth."

"You're... what?"

"Magic is a funny thing. I have heard rumours of your own explorations of magic and suspect much about your mind; I am sure you have come to this realization about magic as well." His expression hardened and Daphne no longer saw the old, wisened man sitting behind the desk atop a tower at Hogwarts. She was looking at the general who had led a small army against the Dark Lord during the Purity War; a man who had duelled the most evil dark sorcerer in a millennia to a standstill. "What took place the night Lord Voldemort attacked Harry was unlike anything we have ever seen. Dark magic of the sort that Voldemort used... it leaves a mark, whether it did its job or not."

Daphne's eyes widened. "You think the Dark Lord might have transmitted the ability to speak with snakes to Potter?"

"It is possible. I admit that I'm unsure, but it is possible. The Potters are an old and mysterious family. It would not surprise me to learn that somewhere down the line, they have a lesser-known or perhaps even an altogether hidden link to Slytherin."

"Sir... if the Dark Lord transmitted the ability to speak with snakes, is it possible he passed other things along to Potter as well?"

"If you are asking me whether or not the curse that touched Harry's forehead that night made him liable to act more like Lord Voldemort, then my answer is no. Magic of that sort can do many things, but I do not believe that to be one of them. Harry is very much his own person and he makes his own decisions."

"But him being able to speak with snakes and being a natural Legilimens, it is a little bit suspicious with everything going on, isn't it?"

"It is certainly suspicious, yes, but I would remind you that many things seem suspicious when we are spending so much of our day jumping at shadows."

"I suppose."

Dumbledore smiled kindly towards her. "I will take what you have said to heart, Miss Greengrass. Rest assured that it will not go unconsidered, nor will it be ignored. I thank you very much for your courage in bringing this all to me and I will do with it as I see fit." He glanced up at the clock on his wall. "Now, I do believe the hour draws late. If you have nothing else to share with me, I think it best if you return to your common room."

Daphne was already on her feet and crossing the room with a blank expression upon her face. She had the strangest feeling that Dumbledore knew much more than he was letting on. What she was even more confident in was the fact that he wasn't going to act. She would give him time to prove her wrong, but if he didn't... she might have to intervene once more.

***December 17, 1992***

***The Great Hall***

***7:28 PM***

The drone of voices in the Great Hall was so loud and constant that Harry could hardly decipher one from the other. It was like the sloppy beating of a thousand deep and booming drums. Bodies were clustered here and there. Harry had entered the hall under his invisibility cloak, but finding a spot to slip it off and into his bag without being noticed proved to be more difficult than he had expected.

It was the first time he had ever seen the hall so packed with people whilst a meal was not in session. Then again, it was a first on many fronts, for never before had Hogwarts organized a club exclusively for duelling and defensive magic.

With the rising danger and tension around the school, Dumbledore had seen fit to authorize the creation of a duelling club to help students improve both their skills and their confidence. Professor Flitwick had taken the lead, seeing as he was a former European Championduelist. He would have other professors assisting him, too. Who they were, Harry wasn't sure. He hoped only that the Headmaster's sadist of a brother was not amongst them.

He shook his head slowly as he faded into the crowd and tried to avoid getting buffeted around like an unnoticed pinball. He had felt off all day. It was entirely Grindelwald's fault, as usual, for the memory he had shown Harry had hit him in a different sort of way.

***The previous night...***

*Herr Grindelwald,*

*We regret to inform you that Durmstrang has received correspondence from the magical authorities in relation to you and your situation outside of this school. It is my obligation to inform you that your father Johan was found dead in your family home last night. He appears to have died of completely natural causes whilst in his sleep.*

*On behalf of all here at Durmstrang, I offer my deepest and most sincere condolences and wish only the best for you moving forward.*

*Regards,*

*Ilyn Shevchenko*

*Highmaster*

Gellert stared blankly down at the sheet of parchment in his hands as though it was written in a foreign language. The words seemed to swing before his eyes and flicker in and out of his line of sight. It was like the parchment was enchanted to befuddle his mind or play some sort of sick and twisted trick on his eyes.

Yet the words were there. They were staring right back up at him and there was no way he could ignore them.

Grindelwald did not feel fear, or anger, or an overwhelming sensation of sadness as he stared down at the parchment. He thought he ought to, but he didn't. He was sure that in time, it would come. He loved... *had* loved his father more than anyone else in the world. It had been he who had rescued him that day at the church. It had been he who had warned him of what was to come and taught him what it meant to be a wizard, and it was he who had cared for Gellert more than anyone else.

Yet Gellert felt none of those things as he stared down at the parchment in his hands.

He just felt blank and empty. The only odd feeling was the sensation in the pit of his stomach. It was not painful, nor was it even uncomfortable. It was just... strange. It was like a piece of something had been there and had suddenly disappeared; like he was all of a sudden one piece short from completing a puzzle he had been at for hours.

Other than that... he felt nothing until that very revelation caused a feeling he was much more familiar with to rise up within him.

Fear... Gellert feared, but not because his father was dead. He did not fear what he would do going forward. He did not fear what would happen to him, nor did he fear for his father now that he was beyond the grave.

Gellert feared for none of these things --- what scared him was that he knew he should be feeling more.

It scared him that he wasn't and he remembered without difficulty the way some of the other students whispered in the halls as he passed by with his cloak billowing behind him. The way the younger students cast furtive glances his way and the way some of the older ones paled any time he drew near.

He had realized a long time ago that it was because they feared him. He knew he was better and more talented, but he had scoffed at the notion of fearing a fellow student then.

But now... maybe they were right to be so wary of him. Maybe it wasn't his magic or his might they feared, but instead, the man who commanded it. If he couldn't even feel for his dead father... what did that mean for him? What did that make him?

The letter was smoking in his hands. Before he knew it, it had been set ablaze and curled into ashes on his lap. He didn't remembered setting it on fire but he needed to stop looking at it. It was making dangerous thoughts race through his mind and his heart pump much too fast. If it had been allowed to continue, he might well have gone the same way as his father.

***Back in the present...***

Harry only managed to cease reminiscing when he noticed that the general chatter in the hall had briefly risen before dying down altogether. He was grateful for how highly elevated the stage was at the front of the hall. He would have been unable to see it whilst trying to look around many taller students who stood stubbornly in his way and seemed as immovable as ancient mountains if it hadn't been.

Three men were making their way on stage. One was much shorter than the others, adorned in thin-looking robes of a deep blue. They somehow seemed to flow with every step he took and Harry could not help but wonder if they were enchanted to allow for a greater range of motion. Snape was dressed the same as always; his black robes billowing behind him as he marched behind Flitwick with a scowl. Harry's blood boiled at the sight of the third. Aberforth Dumbledore was dressed in grey to match much of his hair, though his eyes were every bit as piercing as his brother's.

"Gather round, everyone, gather round!" It was the most excited Harry had ever heard Flitwick, and that was saying a great deal. Harry suspected that the Headmaster may not have been the one to initially propose the idea after all. "Welcome to the first meeting of the newly-formed Hogwarts Duelling Club! Now, the goal of these meetings will be to hone your skills with combat magic. Given the... current troubles, Headmaster Dumbledore and I thought this was the perfect time to revive a long-gone tradition of the school." He stepped aside and allowed his companions to move forward. "Professors Snape and Dumbledore will be assisting me in the running of this club. Both of them are exceptionally talented duellists in their own right."

Harry could picture Flitwick duelling professionally just fine. Darting in and out, deflecting spells, and returning fire. Snape... Harry had a feeling the man fought with a very different style. One that was likely much more frowned upon than that of their Charms Professor. As for Aberforth... he had no idea.

Flitwick had them pair up and practice the Disarming Charm --- Expelliarmus. It was one Harry had known for ages. He ended up paired with Lillian Moon, which was a touch awkward after what had happened with Daphne. He shot a glance in the blonde's direction as Lillian scrambled to fetch her wand. She was not looking back at him and if she felt his stare upon her, she gave him no indication.

Most in the hall had no troubles with the Disarming Charm, but some of the younger years' groups had descended into chaos once it had become apparent they couldn't perform the spell in question. Granger had found herself in some sort of headlock courtesy of Millicent Bulstrode, and Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy looked as though they might consider dropping their wands and deciding their duel the muggle way.

Given the brawling, it was wise of Flitwick to try and teach them the most basic shield charm --- Aegis Vocar --- which led to considerably less chaos. He ran the entire club well and except for the early tussles, it ran smoothly right up until the point he decided to allow them to test themselves against one another in live duels.

Lillian was shuffling before Harry, clearly very nervous for the duel to begin. Harry remembered what Aberforth had said during their last detention whilst goading him. About how Daphne might have thought him the Heir of Slytherin. If it was true, had she told her friends? Was Lillian worried he might petrify her if the duel didn't go his way? Or was she worried that Harry had powers the rest of them couldn't dream of and he planned on obliterating her right there in the centre of the Great Hall?

"Potter!" The voice lashed at him like a whip. Harry turned with a scowl, for he recognized the voice. "I've seen what you're capable of," Aberforth said with a stern expression. "The point is to test yourself. Over here with Weasley."

Harry thought for a moment that he meant Ronald but quickly realized that was not the case. He was directed not towards the tall, gangly redhead whom he had beaten to the snitch, but one of the broader fourth years who had flown around the pitch that day whilst wielding a beater\'s bat.

Harry's heart began to quicken. The only student the twins' age or older he had duelled was Cassie. Those duels had never gone favourably for him, but she was supposedly a prodigy when it came to combat magic. The twins... they were devilishly clever, the both of them. They had also been malicious bastards ever since Halloween, but particularly since Colin Creevey had gone missing and Slytherin had bested them on the Quidditch pitch. It said a lot about their antics that --- until Dobby had appeared before him in the hospital wing --- Harry had seriously considered the Weasley twins as the culprits behind the cursed bludger that had landed him a night's stay with Madam Pomfrey.

Harry wasn't sure which of the twins he was looking at, but it hardly mattered. The boy was leering down at him with a dangerous look in his eye. A shiver ran up Harry's spine, but he fought down the urge to shudder. He wouldn't give the bastard the satisfaction. He had seen what the twins had done to normal Slytherins --- he hardly wanted to imagine what this one was about to try and do to the one whom some suspected of being the Heir of Slytherin.

"When you hear the gong," said Flitwick, "the duels will begin. Remember, nothing that can lead to any injuries, please. Now, get ready!"

Harry tensed and prepared to spring to the side. He could see the twin leaning forward and he was sure the boy would rush him.

*Gong!*

The older boy lunged forward and Harry dove out of the way. Three spells sailed through the space his head had been a moment earlier and Harry was all of a sudden very grateful for the time Cassie had spent teaching him how to learn an opponent's body language. High-level duellists would usually either show nothing at all or potentially even mislead their opponent, but it was clear that for however clever the twin in front of him was, he wasn't necessarily experienced as a duellist.

Not that the fact was helping Harry much. His casting was swift and his intent was brutal. Cutting Curses, Bludgeoning Curses, Banishing Hexes, and a number of spells Harry didn't recognize were among the boy's favourites. His casting was rapid and he was so offensive that Harry was struggling to find a pause in his casting to fire back with an offence of his own. He was constantly on the back foot and all the dodging and shielding was more fatiguing by the second.

That was when he realized a third option. Harry dodged two jets of purple light and recognized the twin's next spell as a Stunner. He brought up his wand and batted the spell back towards him. The twin shielded, but Harry fired off three Bludgeoning Curses in quick succession. They slammed into the boy's shield one after another and it sparked out. Harry's next three spells were a Disarming Charm, a Cutting Curse, and a Stunner, but none of them found their mark.

The boy dove to the side, but Harry had anticipated it. Weasley knew more spells than him and was more physically fit, but Harry knew what to watch for and he didn't. It was the second time it had cost the older boy, and Harry hoped it would be the last.

"Depulso!"

The spell caught the boy in mid-dive and he was sent sailing through the air in a fashion similar to how Harry had managed to beat Cadmus Yaxley last week in the Slytherin common room. The difference was that Harry's opponent tonight was clever enough to hit the ground rolling and avoid having the wind knocked out of him. Harry mentally cursed. With all of the ill-thought decisions the Weasley twins made, it was perfectly in character for both of them to know how to take impact as well as professional stunt doubles in the muggle world.

Harry's wand had not been idle and he was sending another volley of spells soaring towards his opponent. The boy's expression had changed now. He was no longer looking like a cat who had cornered a mouse. He now had the look of a predator who had been taken off guard and backed into a corner. Harry knew how bad it would hurt the boy's pride to lose to a second year and Harry wanted nothing more than to win.

Yet he knew the second he saw a gleam of mischief dance into his opponent's eye that something was wrong. He prepared to shield or deflect, but the incantation the boy shouted was not one he recognized.

"Serpensortia!"

The snake that seemed to leap from the tip of the boy's wand had to be nearly ten feet long. Its skin was a dark green that resembled fallen leaves, but its scales seemed to gleam more sinisterly in the torchlight of the hall than any bit of foliage could ever have.

It was spitting and hissing as it slithered towards Harry, but the boy was frozen. There was nothing he could think of to counter this. He could throw a Cutting Curse towards the snake, but he doubted it would be strong enough to do a great deal of damage and it would probably do nothing but set the creature even more on edge than it already was. He had no doubt the Lacero Curse would cut it cleanly in half, but that wasn't exactly a spell he wanted to use in public.

He glanced up towards Weasley and saw the shit-eating grin the boy was wearing. Anger seethed in Harry's stomach at the sight of it and he suddenly realized through some sort of strange instinct what the boy was hoping for. If Harry really was the Heir of Slytherin, he would be able to call the snake off with little more than a hiss. That was undoubtedly why he hadn't tried to disarm him whilst he was distracted. If he did, the duel would end and the snake would be dispatched before Harry could reveal himself.

It was a masterstroke, Harry would grant the bastard that, but he wasn't going to play into the boy's scheme. He would let the snake bite him before he allowed the entire school to turn against him like that.

"Evanesco."

Snape's voice sliced through the tense atmosphere of their duel like a knife through dripping hot butter. The snake vanished as soon as the man had uttered his final syllable and Harry did not fail to notice the scowl that crossed Weasley's face as his plan was foiled.

Harry's wand snapped up to continue the duel, but Snape wasn't finished.

"Enough, both of you!" Harry lowered his wand with great reluctance only when he saw Weasley do the same. Only then did he realize that the entire hall was quiet. They had been the final two combatants and everyone had been watching them with rapt attention. "Weasley," Snape spat, "what exactly did you think you were doing when you conjured a snake that was very clearly venomous? What part of trying not to inflict a serious injury did you fail to understand? I thought the instructions were quite clear, but do we need to be sharper in our instructions going forward? Maybe then, they might have a chance of penetrating that thick head of yours."

The boy stared back at Snape completely unabashed and Harry took the opportunity to fade back into the crowd, though his eyes never left the boy who had for all intents and purposes bested him. If the Weasley twins were out to prove that he was the Heir of Slytherin, he was going to need to tread even more carefully going forward.

***December 18, 1992***

***The Headmaster's Office***

***9:41 PM***

"I believe that will do for tonight." Dumbledore's statement was like music to Harry's ears. They had been at it for nearly two hours, though he knew great progress had been made. "Congratulations, Harry," said Dumbledore. "I do believe you have progressed through this stage in the development of your psychic defences."

Harry could not help but smile. "Thank you, sir. I really do appreciate all the time you've spent helping me."

"There is no need for thanks, dear boy. It is a pleasure to watch one with your talent improve. How have your studies in Transfiguration progressed?"

Harry had come to Dumbledore seeking advice in Transfiguration once he had seen exactly how quickly Grindelwald had been moving through the Durmstrang material. The man had been an invaluable aid in his own progression. He had been well behind where Grindelwald had been at the same age, but the gap between them at the same point in their education was closing swiftly. Harry was even confident he could edge ahead of the former dark lord by the end of the school year if he kept at it.

"They've been going really well, sir. Your advice has made a huge difference and has really helped me improve."

"I am glad to hear it. I do so love teaching. I am quite fond of these sessions for that reason and I am more than happy to instruct in other things as well."

"I might ask you about something with Charms and Runes after the break if you don't mind."

The man's eyes twinkled. "Runes, you say? An ambitious goal for one who is not eligible to begin classes on the subject until September."

Harry shrugged. "I've heard they're really useful." He had done more than hear. Runes had been how Daphne verified Harry's suspicions about Travers being the one to send him the envelope full of bubotuber pus.

"They are one of the foundational branches of magic and their usefulness cannot be overstated," Dumbledore agreed. "Do not mistake my surprise for disappointment. It brings me great joy to see you taking an interest. Your ambition is just unusual for one your age."

"Most people my age didn't see what I saw at the end of last year, sir."

Dumbledore looked like he'd bitten into something foul. "No, fortunately, they do not."

"Sir, can I ask you something that I probably shouldn't?"

Dumbledore's lips twitched. "I may choose not to answer, but you may ask."

"I heard a rumour that there was another attack today. Somebody said something about a ghost being petrified, but a bunch of others said that wasn't possible. Were they true?"

Dumbledore sighed very deeply as he rubbed at his eyes. "I am afraid they are very much true, yes."

"How is it possible, sir? For a ghost to be petrified, I mean?"

"I must confess to you that I have no idea. There can be no physical interaction with beings beyond the veil, so the weapons that can be used against them are quite limited. Of the few I know of, none would match the effects this Heir of Slytherin has achieved."

"Do you have any idea who the Heir might be, sir?"

Dumbledore did not so much as blink as he stared straight ahead. Harry had the impression that the man was not puzzled by the question, but that he was deciding exactly how much he wanted to reveal in his answer.

"I have a common theme that I am looking for in my investigation," was what he eventually decided upon in place of an answer. "I am quite certain I know who opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago, so it gives me somewhere to start."

"Half the school thinks it's me." Harry wasn't sure what made him say it, but he supposed it was probably the weeks of pent-up frustration over the whole thing and the stress he had been under for almost the entire year.

"You are an interesting case," said Dumbledore.

Harry's heart fluttered. "What do you mean by that, sir?"

"You are a person who is very easy to suspect. I can understand exactly why so many people are suspicious of you." He raised a hand just as Harry opened his mouth to speak. "Please don't mistake my meaning. I do not believe you are in any way responsible for any of what has happened this past year. I simply understand where the others' suspicion stems from."

"I don't," said Harry. "I sort of understand Colin, since people think I had a motive, but Tracey? She was one of the only friends I have. Why would I attack her?"

"To throw the masses off of your trail, perhaps, or else because you learned some sort of secret or had been masquerading as the girl's friend all along." Dumbledore smiled thinly at the thunderstruck expression Harry knew he must be wearing. "What you must understand about people is that they will believe exactly what it is they want to believe. Once an idea blossoms in a human being's mind, most of us have a very nasty habit of framing everything we see in the context of that idea. Really, we would be much better off to try and frame that idea with everything it is we see, but alas, we are creatures composed of many biases and desires. Chief amongst the latter is the urge to be correct."

"But it's stupid," said Harry. "How could I be the Heir of Slytherin?"

Dumbledore watched him very closely. "Some people believe that on the night Lord Voldemort attacked you, the horrid curse that touched you did much more than rebound upon its caster."

"Do they think it changed me or something? That sounds like utter rubbish."

"It is, but utter rubbish, as you call it, is often rooted in some form of logic or truth." Dumbledore leant forward. "Tell me, Harry, can you speak to snakes?"

Harry's throat constricted. It was like the muscles in his chest had coiled around his heart, which had risen to the challenge and was now beating so fiercely it was like it thought it could force its way through the walls of flesh and muscle.

Telling Dumbledore this secret was dangerous. It implicated him as the Heir of Slytherin and might change the man's opinion in regards to his guilt. There was also the past to consider. Harry had trusted Draco with a great many things and the boy had betrayed him. Daphne had been no better.

Dumbledore though... he was known as the greatest wizard alive. Could men like him fall victim to such folly? Was it likely he would betray Harry if he knew such a damning secret? Dumbledore had been one of the most positive influences Harry had ever known, but there had been a time when he'd thought the same thing about Draco...

But there was more to consider here. It was an oddly specific question. It was like Dumbledore already knew. It was as though he wanted to confirm or else test him. But how? How could Dumbledore know that he was a Parselmouth?

Unless...

Unless one of his housemates had snitched? Perhaps one of them had come forth and spilled the story of him speaking Parseltongue in the common room. If that was true, he thought he knew which one and it meant that Aberforth's jab about Daphne suspecting him had been more true than the man had known.

Harry met Dumbledore's stare head-on as he answered the man's question. "Yes, sir. I can."

"May I ask when you became aware of the ability?"

"I... think I might have spoken to snakes in the garden when I was little, but the first time I really remember noticing something was weird was when I talked with a snake at the London zoo." He averted his eyes. "I also made the glass disappear."

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "An excellent piece of accidental magic, if I do say so myself." His expression became more serious. "Have you ever thought about why, Harry? Why it is you can speak with snakes when the Potter family has no known connection to Slytherin --- whom all Parselmouths in Britain are said to descend from?"

"The thought's crossed my mind," he admitted.

"It is my belief that you can speak to snakes because Lord Voldemort can," said Dumbledore. The fingers of his left hand drummed atop his desk as he used his right hand to stroke his long silver beard. "The curse Lord Voldemort used against you is unique in many ways. Its effects run deeper than the skin and touch the very soul. Very few spells can do this and it makes the ones that can both mysterious and unique. Nobody had survived that curse before you, so I am guessing here, but I do believe that the spell forged a connection between yourself and Lord Voldemort. A connection that may run deeper than any connection two witches or wizards have ever shared before."

"So you think the spell lets me speak to snakes because he can?"

"I think it is a great deal more complicated than that, but that is a simple and succinct way of saying it, yes."

Harry ran a hand through his hair as he cast his eyes about the room, trying to decide how to ask his next question. "Sir... is there anything else I should know about that night? Anything else the spell did that should worry me? Voldemort didn't imprint on me or anything, did he? The spell isn't going to make me more like him, is it?"

There was desperation in his voice as Harry remembered the nothingness Grindelwald had felt at the loss of his father and how eerily similar it was to how Harry felt about his own parents.

***"Come... come to me... let me rip you... let me tear you... let me kill you..."***

A shudder ran up his spine as he remembered the voice inside his head the first night he had spent in Aberforth's office. Could the voice be some form of Voldemort lurking inside of him? Could this explain the coldness he had felt as of late? The way he had snapped with Yaxley and why he was sympathizing so deeply with Grindelwald.

Dumbledore met his gaze with the same intensity Harry had when revealing his Parseltongue ability. "No. There is nothing else about that night that needs to concern you. You have my word."

***Later that night, somewhere in Albania...***

A soft and bitter breeze sent dry leaves hissing across the yellowing grass as it swept across the lands, bringing with it the biting chill of winter. Several crows rose into the air and squawked as though the wind had disturbed them. Their protests echoed across the otherwise quiet land, but they eventually lowered in the sky and rested back in their perches high in the vast number of trees at the edge of a great, open clearing.

Until a loud and sudden crack tore through the silence and sent them scattering. Their squawks were louder and more indignant this time, but they died in the wind as every last one of them fled, scared off by the sudden and unexplained noise.

A man beneath a black travelling cloak watched the crows leave before making sure the Disillusionment Charm he'd cast upon himself before the final jump of apparition needed to take him here was still active. It had wavered slightly, but it was still in place. He made sure it was at full strength before he cast his gaze around.

He stood at the edge of a vast clearing. There was virtually nothing on his left or right and he knew that there was a great deal of empty land behind him. A great forest stood before him. Trees taller than buildings stood close enough to one another that their branches were tangled so tightly it appeared as though they were tied in great knots. The foliage was so thick that even here, on the edge of the forest, the man beneath the cloak could hardly see ten feet into the great mass of trees.

It did not deter him as he stepped forward and slipped into the vast cluster of branches and leaves. He had known all too well when he had departed for this place that he would have his work cut out for him. Men like him did not fear the dark nor the unknown, so he wasn't going to let the potential of getting lost or trapped dissuade him from his purpose.

***Durmstrang Institute***

***11:22 PM***

Gellert's heart beat rapidly as he stared down at the boy before him, crouched and pulled back as though preparing to be struck. He had planned this for some time but now that the moment had arrived, he was unsure whether he would be able to do it. His throat was as constricted as it had been when smoke rose around him in great clouds as he stood atop the flaming pyre. Every inch of him tingled with nervous adrenaline and frantic anticipation.

He cast his eyes about the room as though to ensure no one was intruding, but he knew that no one would. Nobody in the castle, student or staff, was capable of penetrating the ward scheme around this room; he was sure of that. It had been at the end of his fourth year when he had begun to realize he was advancing farther than many of his professors. It had been a revelation that changed him. It was a revelation that had planted the seed in his mind that maybe he would one day be capable of achieving things that had once been mere dreams.

But if he wanted to see those dreams blossom into reality, he would need to conquer this. Everything he wanted would take more than ability; it would take boldness and courage. How was he to begin making progress on those worldwide ambitions if he could not will himself to do this?

Gellert looked down at the boy once more and allowed the pent-up anger and agony he had been suppressing all day to seep through self-made cracks in his Occlumency. This was his reminder; it was why he had to do this. There had to be a better solution than suppressing everything and allowing it to destroy him when he could hold it in no longer. There had to be a better alternative to the crushing pain in his chest and pangs in his stomach every time he pictured his father's body lying lifeless in a coffin exactly one year earlier. There was a better solution and he was going to find it because he knew that no one else could.

He closed his eyes and crushed every one of his apprehensions with but a thought and raised his wand. His hand did not so much as tremble as the long, dark stick of wood slowly turned to point directly at the kneeling boy's forehead.

"Legilimens!"

Memories flashed through Gellert's mind with the speed of blinking lights. It was like the rush of colours and shapes one experienced when travelling via portkey, but every one of them was a thought or a memory that Gellert swiftly deciphered. It had taken a great deal of practice to master the offensive branch of the Mind Arts, but it had been a boon unlike almost anything he had ever learned before. And if it would allow him to do this...

He pulled his attention away from the thoughts and memories and pushed deeper into the boy's mind. He didn't need to see what the brain was projecting --- he needed to see *how* it was projecting. Then he would go deeper once more. *Seeing* was not going to be enough. *Interacting* was what he needed to do.

Gellert focused on his active streams of thought brought forth via Occlumency and directed several of them to work on guiding the boy's memories and thoughts towards the most painful things he had ever experienced. The rest of Gellert's brain power turned further inwards and shifted his attention to not his thoughts, but the things that caused the sensations those thoughts brought forth. He couldn't see the neurons, exactly, but he could feel them. He could feel their current and could tell what they were doing on an instinctual level. He could feel them flare at the memories of pain and distress and he took hold of that reaction and did something akin to twisting as he warped it to fit exactly what he needed to accomplish...

Pain unlike anything he had ever imagined washed over him. He thought someone had cursed him from behind for a moment, but then he realized it was his other, independent streams of thought guiding the boy's memories. It was not his pain he was feeling, but that of the student whose mind he occupied. Gellert tried to block it out, but he couldn't. It was so intense that not even Occlumency could protect him. He pulled back and out of the boy's mind with a single scream as he fell backwards and twitched for a minute on the floor as the other boy screamed his throat hoarse and convulsed.

Panic was flashing through Grindelwald's mind as he managed to push himself up to his knees. The world spun all around him as he did so and a reddish haze of pain seemed to cloud his vision like a crimson veil of mist.

Or maybe his vision was just blurred and he was seeing the blood coming from the other boy's skull. His spell had left no physical damage, but the pain his counterpart was experiencing was so intense that he was raking at his own skull so hard he had torn much of the skin away, fingernails seeking to end pain they could not reach. Blood spattered the floor like grotesque droplets of rain. The streams were growing thicker and thicker as the boy's desperate clawing continued. Gellert knew that if he did not intervene soon, the blood would flow like a crimson waterfall and the boy might be lost forever.

His arm felt as though it weighed twice his total mass and he just barely managed to lift his wand and call forth a vibrant flash of red light. He heard the boy's body slump to the floor but saw none of it; blackness had closed in on all sides and he'd crumpled as all thoughts of panic and sensations of pain ceased in one single instant.

Harry awoke with a gasp and became immediately aware of bile rising at the back of his throat. A cold layer of sweat coated his flesh. It had been quite some time since a memory from Grindelwald had shaken him, but this one had done it. He had become accustomed to them. They had just become normal to him, but they had not been like this. He had been grudgingly enjoying watching Grindelwald progress through Durmstrang with unmatched prowess. He had seen him cast dark curses in those memories, but this? This was entirely different... it just felt wrong.

He leant over the side of his bed and felt the acid and chunks of half-digested food come spilling forth. He was shaking badly and a chill gripped him tight as a vice. It was like a bitter wind was tearing at his bones, yet the sweat still coated him.

What he had seen was unlike anything that had come before it. The memory of Wylla Nurmen's execution had been the most graphically disturbing thing Harry had ever seen. It had left scars on him that ran deeper than the skin and he knew it. The feeling of being burnt alive had been almost equally surreal, as had the crushing nothingness Grindelwald had felt after losing his father.

This had been different. There had been blood, but not like before. There were no chunks of bone or mutilated organs strewn about the classroom floor like fallen autumn leaves. It hadn't even been the way the boy had screamed and clawed at his own skull. That cacophony had been disturbing in its own way, but it wasn't what bothered Harry.

What bothered him was hard to describe. It was just... Grindelwald. He'd shown no regard for the boy whatsoever. He had been horrified at the result of his experiment, but Harry had not gotten the impression he was worried about the boy's condition for even a second.

And the experiment itself...

Harry didn't understand. He had been in Grindelwald's head and experienced his rationale, but it still made no sense to him, nor did the experiment's purpose. He had just breached the boy's mind and taken over a fundamental element of the human body.

His shaking intensified at the thought. He knew that Legilimency could be used to read thoughts and see memories, but this had been something Harry had never dreamed of. It scared him more than any curse and he knew he would stop at nothing to master Occlumency now. There was no alternative after seeing that --- he would become the greatest occlumens the world had ever seen if that was what it took to keep *that* from happening.

But that was the future. For now... he wanted to understand and he hated it. He hated Grindelwald, he hated the memories, he hated all of it! Most of all, he hated the way his brain made connections. He hated that he could understand where Grindelwald was coming from much of the time and he hated the fact that even now, after seeing something so sick and twisted, he was not so much repulsed as drawn in.

The thought scared him...

Harry closed his eyes and slumped back on his pillow, fingering the chain he had grown accustomed to sleeping with all the way back in the summer during the weeks when Grindelwald had helped him master the ability to wandlessly unlock doors.

His eyes were suddenly open again, but he was not in the Slytherin common room. He was in a dark square of a room with so little light that he could hardly make out the gaunt figure sitting on the room's only bit of furniture.

"So you have returned," Grindelwald said with a thin smile. "I knew you would."

"Why?" Harry asked, his voice a desperate croak hardly louder than a whisper.

Grindelwald made a tsk tsk sound. "Do not waste your words. Words are weapons more powerful than any spell and more versatile than any stick of wood. Use them correctly. Do not ask foolish, open-ended questions." His eyes found Harry in the oppressive darkness. "Unless, of course, you are trying to draw more information out of me. If that is the case, I have overestimated you."

"All of it," said Harry. "Why did you do that to the boy? Why were you so obsessed with magic? Why are you showing me all of this?"

"Three very different questions," said Grindelwald. "The boy meant nothing to me and I did not believe I could fail. I was young and arrogant. I did not believe for a single second that my masterfully constructed technique would prove anything less than perfect."

"What were you trying to do? I... I didn't get it."

"No, I doubted you would." Grindelwald stood to his feet and walked towards his cell's window. It was barred, just like the door, but it overlooked the shimmering surface of a frozen lake.

"Is that... Lake Königssee?"

Grindelwald nodded, but he did not turn back to Harry. "Do you know of the Mind Arts?"

"Yes," said Harry. "The incantation you used was Legilimens. It creates a link to use Legilimency."

"It does indeed. The mind is a very complex thing. It can do much more than present assailants with tales and truths. It is a powerful thing and that power can be harnessed. That is what I sought to do. Can you guess why?"

"Your father's death. It was bothering you; you were thinking about it."

"Yes, but also no." Grindelwald had yet to turn and face Harry. Still he looked out over the lake far below them and at the shadowy outlines of the mountains that surrounded it. From this vantage point, they loomed above even the highest of their peaks. "There is a technique used by practitioners of Occlumency who wish to guard their mind against weakness. It allows the user to suppress all emotion once it is mastered."

"But that wasn't what you were doing."

"It was not. That was what I had been doing for many months." Grindelwald's fingers drummed on the sill of the window. They were long and skeletal. All that made them up seemed to have faded away over time. His skin seemed to glow in the darkness and appeared as thin and frail as torn parchment.

"I still don't get it."

"I felt nothing for a time and feared that I had lost what it meant to be human, but it took me over in due time. My father was all I had. You saw the spiteful incarnation that called herself my mother and what she did. When I was a boy, I carried so many delusions. Delusions that I would live happily with my father for the rest of time. Delusions that the man who had saved me so bravely was untouchable."

He turned slowly back towards Harry for the first time. "It was foolish of me to think such a thing. Death is a shadow that looms over the world. Its tendrils will uncoil every so often and touch whomever it pleases. It has no mercy and no judgement. It does not care who you are or what you have done. I learned that all those years ago and it is a lesson I kept."

"But you tried to beat it. In the Durmstrang library... you were reading about necromancy after your father died, and of the stone from the story your father read to you."

"For a time. I was foolish, as I have said. Death cannot be cheated so easily as casting a spell, nor do I believe it could be cheated by turning over a stone."

"But you wanted it, didn't you? The stone, I mean?"

"Oh, yes... I wanted it very badly. But I wanted them all. The Deathstick, the Reaper's stone, Death's own Cloak... I wanted them all. Only by possessing all three could one ever hope to master death."

"You believe it, then?" Grindelwald raised an eyebrow; Harry could hardly see it, but the hair was white and stood out in the blackness of the cell. "I went and found a copy of the book that was translated into English in the Hogwarts library. It said that by having all three---"

"That one would be the master of death. Yes, yes, I have heard that said."

"And you believed it?"

"I do not believe that possessing the artifacts makes one immortal. That is nonsensical; merely holding something does not grant one power beyond measure. I simply believe that the Deathly Hallows were unearthly in their powers and that by mastering all three, one might gain the power to fend off death for a time." He shrugged. "It is said that Ignotus Peverell was only claimed by the Reaper when he stepped out from under the very cloak the entity had given him. I think the facet of the story which contains Death to be a falsehood, but metaphors can be assumed and truths can be drawn."

"But what about what you were doing to that boy?"

"Ah, yes, getting back to the point, I see. My father's death struck me hard after a time. I detested the feelings that loss brought down upon me. I was locked in the pursuit of greatness and I could not afford such distractions."

"But why attack that boy? Why not just use Occlumency like you said?"

"A novice at best, I see." Harry blushed, but Grindelwald went on without paying him so much as a glance. "You do not simply turn *off* emotions. They define us; they make us human. If I had nullified grief for the rest of time, I would have ceased to be who I am."

"Then what is it you had been doing?"

"The suggested methodology is to suppress the emotions whilst you need to focus and allow them to slowly drip through the cracks you form later on. If you allow them to build for too long without nullifying them all together, they will surge forth in a great wave and drown you."

"So you tried something else?"

""I did. The conventional method was unsatisfactory. It did not meet my needs. I could not afford distractions and would never allow myself to be weak again after what it had cost me in my youth, yet if I was not human, the greatness I was chasing would be for naught. It was a perplexing dichotomy for a time, but I was so certain I had found the answer by the moment you saw me in that room had come. I was sure the way was to feel the emotion but to feel none of its effects. To allow it to exist and flow, crashing against your mind but not allowing cracks to form and spread. I was sure of this and I was certain I could do it. It would take altering the nervous system and some experimentation with particular neurons, but I thought it was possible."

"You were wrong."

"I was not. I found out many years later that it was indeed possible, but it would not achieve what I desired. It is of no matter. What is done is done."

"What about the boy? What happened to him? Was anybody able to fix it?"

It was hard to tell in the lightless cell, but Harry thought the corners of Grindelwald's mouth were threatening to tug upwards. He thought he saw smugness in the man's eyes, but he couldn't be sure.

"The expert they called forth was the foremost practitioner of the Mind Arts in Europe, they said." Grindelwald's eyes gleamed. "He was utterly perplexed and to my knowledge, the boy never recovered."

Harry felt as though he would throw up again. "That's it? He never recovered? You don't even care!" He spat the last words at Grindelwald as though they would cause him physical pain, but they seemed to roll off of him like streaming water down a sheet of glass.

"He is of no consequence. He was all too willing to leave me crippled for life and he had no role to play in what would come. The world was better off without him; he was of no value. I took no pleasure in what happened to him, but it has never kept me up at night. His incapacitation changed nothing that concerned me."

"Why are you doing this? You obviously don't care about anyone else, so why are you showing me all of this?"

"Because you are different. I have answered this before. You can change the world in ways he never could. Your star shines brighter than those I snuffed out. Surely, you will see the wisdom in my work. You have seen but a taste of what drove me towards greatness and the pursuit of peace and tranquillity."

"You can keep it!" Harry spat at him. "You can keep all of it! I'm done with this... I'm done with you."

Grindelwald's expression went blank. "What has inspired this?"

You're doing things to my mind... you're changing me. I think differently now than when I started seeing the memories." His posture had straightened and he was staring daggers at Grindelwald, his eyes alight like emerald fires. "I won't let you brainwash me like you did all those people who fought for you. Stop sending me these memories --- I'm *done*."

Grindelwald looked at him for a long time; not moving once to even blink throughout the silence that lay heavy between them. "If that is what you wish," he said softly, and the world around Harry faded to black once more.

***Malfoy Manor***

***8:56 PM***

Lucius's office was dark and had no windows. Diana had no doubt her father could have conjured copious amounts of magical light had he desired to, but he hadn't. The only light in the room was a lantern that flickered on his desk. It sent patches of light glaring across Lucius's face, turning the regal features into something more ghostly and skeletal-looking. Shadows seemed to reach out from the flame in tendrils, pool on the floor, and leap here and there about the room. It was an intimidating sort of atmosphere and Diana wondered whether or not those were her father's intentions. Lucius Malfoy was not a man to miss out on such subtle details.

"Do you think the boys' relationship is mendable?"

Diana knew he was referring to Draco and Harry. Her brother had been instructed to stay at school over the holidays, but Diana had been allowed to come home under the pretence of attending several social events with her father as his heiress.

"I think so." She spoke quietly and chose every word with great caution as she looked up to meet her father's dark grey eyes. "Neither of them have any real problems with the other as a person."

"Then why does the conflict exist?"

"Harry is upset because he feels that Draco betrayed him. Draco is just too stubborn to admit he was wrong twice." She rolled her eyes. "Especially because this time, he let jealousy ruin everything."

"It is an unattractive trait he will need to curb in the near future. I will not have a Malfoy letting such petty things bring them down. He has no reason to be jealous over something as worthless as a Quidditch position."

"He's still a child."

"The time for Draco's childishness is at an end. It will no longer be tolerated. Changes are coming very soon. Draco will need to grow up very fast if he wishes to progress in the world after these changes take place."

"Do you want me to talk to him once I'm back at Hogwarts?"

"No. I want to see how Draco reacts without prompting. It will be a test. You carried him through his friendships last year and he learned nothing. A firmer hand is needed here. The time for coddling has come and gone."

Diana twirled a lock of blonde hair around her finger as she tilted her head to the side. "May I ask what these changes you keep talking about are, Father?"

"It is better if you don't know. Enjoy your innocence while you still can. We will speak about things this summer."

Diana dipped her head. "Was that all you wanted to talk to me about?"

"No." Lucius opened a drawer of his desk and snatched his wand from its surface. He flicked it and a sheet of parchment came drifting up and into Diana's hands.

She skimmed it quickly. "That's... interesting," she said, "and I wouldn't have ever guessed so many people read the *Quibbler*, but what do newspaper statistics have to do with anything we've discussed?"

"It isn't the statistics that concern me, it is what they represent." Lucius leant forward in his chair and folded his hands on the surface of his desk. Diana had seen this before and recognized it as her father's favourite lecturing posture. "Perception is a weapon that cuts much deeper than any spell. The best generals position themselves to win a war before a single shot is ever fired."

"Is that what you're talking about? When you say that changes are coming, are you talking about a war? Are the old forces trying to come together again?"

"The why is not important. All I need is results."

Diana blanked her expression and met her father's eyes. "What do you need me to do?"

Lucius pointed to a specific number beside each of the major newspaper publications listed on the sheet of parchment. "I trust you understand what that figure means beyond its monetary implications?"

"Control." Diana's answer came instantly and without any hesitation.

Lucius nodded. "You might notice that the number beside the publication we've mentioned doesn't imply a great deal of control." Diana nodded slowly, starting to understand where her father was taking this conversation. "The lunatic who runs the rag won't take money, so I would like to gain control in a different way." The spark that flashed in his grey eyes looked like a jagged line of lightning jutting across a stormy sky. "I do believe the owner of our targeted investment has a young daughter at Hogwarts..."

***December 25, 1992***

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***8:42 PM***

An odd tingle ran up Harry's spine when he stepped into the Slytherin common room the night of Yule. The day had dawned bright and sunny and he had enjoyed much of it out on the grounds with Cassius after they had opened their gifts that morning. They had only retreated back into the castle when the sun began to fall behind the horizon and its light began to wane. That had been their cue to come inside and clean up before that evening's feast in the Great Hall.

That had finished some time ago and Harry had parted ways from Cassius as soon as it had. He had gone off to do his prefect rounds whilst Harry had decided to explore the castle under the guise of his invisibility cloak. He was finding more and more secrets the longer he explored. Every time he thought he had covered every inch of the castle, something new and hidden leapt out at him and renewed his interest in his explorations.

Cassius had not yet returned to the common room by the time Harry entered, so he strode towards an armchair near the fire. There was an empty one beside it he would reserve for one of the only friends he had left.

The common room was nearly empty apart from him. Almost all of the Slytherins had gone home for the winter break. Harry was still somewhat taken aback that Cassius seemed not to, but he never asked why. His older friend had never asked him, either. It was a sort of unspoken pact between the two of them, one that told Harry all he needed to know about the reasons for Cassius's willingness to stay behind in the drafty dungeons while the others returned to warm and spacious family manors.

The only other students in the common room sat not too far from Harry. They were Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle. Harry thought it was odd that Draco had stayed behind when his sister had gone home, but he tried not to think about it. Trying not to think about Draco was much easier than actually thinking about him. It caused less frustration and didn't usually result in a headache.

Harry unwittingly cast his eyes towards the group his thoughts lingered on and a snippet of conversation reached his ears.

"You know, I'm surprised the *Prophet* hasn't reported all of these attacks yet." From Harry's vantage point, he could not see Draco, whose back was turned away from him, only Crabbe and Goyle.

"It is weird," muttered Goyle.

"I suppose Dumbledore's trying to cover it up. I would too, if I were him. He'll be sacked if the attacks don't stop. Father will make sure of that. He's been sick of Dumbledore's rubbish for years and won't put up with it if he has an excuse to get rid of him." Harry could practically see Draco sneer even with the boy's back turned towards him. "A decent headmaster would never let in slime like Creevey. Personally, I'm rooting for the Heir, whomever it is. The fewer muggleborns around here, the better."

Harry did not fail to miss the way Draco had avoided his typical slur for muggleborns. He felt a leaping sensation in his heart for less than a second before something else caught his eyes.

He saw... something flash across Goyle's face. It was fast, but he caught it and played it over again in his mind. It was anger. Why had Goyle looked angry? He and Crabbe usually drunk up everything Malfoy said the way a man lost in the desert might hopelessly try and suck up every last drop of an imagined oasis.

So why did Goyle look so angry for what had to have been at least a second?

It could have been nothing, but Harry knew it wasn't. He couldn't explain how he knew, he just did. It was the same feeling he'd had the morning he had asked Draco not to sell out Hagrid and the dragon; the morning he had suspected his former friend's betrayal but failed to act. It was that same feeling again, and it was screaming at him more insistently than ever before that something was wrong and unnatural.

Draco's voice practically pierced his ears as he mocked Creevey in a voice so high and shrill that Harry feared any glass in the castle might shatter into a million broken pieces.

He watched Crabbe and Goyle very closely throughout Malfoy's tirade and his suspicions only mounted just as Malfoy began inquiring after the both of them for failing to laugh at his impression.

Harry squinted at the both of them. It felt as though he was trying to burn a hole straight through them with his stare alone and Goyle must have noticed. He looked away from Draco and met Harry's eye...

Harry jolted so hard that he almost leapt up out of his chair. His perspective had shifted in the moment before he broke eye contact. He had not been looking at Crabbe and Goyle, but at himself and Draco. The sensations he'd felt... they were not his own. He was not feeling so tense, anxious, and irrationally angry.

That had been like nothing he had ever experienced before... yet it was very similar to something he knew very well.

He had somehow performed Legilimency.

As crazy as the thought was, Harry could think of no other realistic answer to how the incident had come to be. There was no other magic he knew that could accomplish anything of the sort and he was very sure that what had just happened was firmly rooted in magic of some kind. There was also the fact that Goyle had gone pale. He was staring at Harry with eyes as wide as saucers and Harry was watching him even more intently now.

Something was most definitely wrong.

"I just wish I knew who was behind it all," Draco was saying. "I could help them... not that they seem to need it. I'd have at least liked to send them a card and some flowers."

"You must have some idea who's behind it?"

That had been Crabbe and it made Harry even more certain something was off. Crabbe was quiet and generally only spoke when spoken to. It was like his personality along with Goyle's had just completely changed. Almost as though they weren't even the same people...

*"Polyjuice Potion is illegal because it allows one person to take on the exact appearance of another. I doubt even any of you are thickheaded enough to miss the potential implications of such a potion."*

It all made sense as soon as the memory of Snape discussing polyjuice potion in one of their first lessons of the year floated to the forefront of Harry's mind. It might have seemed insane a month ago to think that Hogwarts students would use an illegal potion to try and get to the bottom of something, but that had been before Daphne had sought to poison him.

Come to think of it, Snape's description of Veritaserum from that same lesson seemed strangely reminiscent of the colourless, odourless liquid that seemed to be in the goblet of pumpkin juice he had kept hidden in his dorm ever since that fateful morning in the Great Hall.

"You know I don't, Crabbe," snapped Malfoy. "Father won't tell me what happened the last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened. All I know is that it was fifty years ago and that a muggleborn actually *died*. If the attacks keep going, it's only a matter of time before it happens again." He paused for a moment and Harry had no doubt his expression had shifted to something malicious. "Here's hoping that whatever the hell is attacking students gets Granger."

That was when Harry was sure. The look in Goyle's eyes... it told him everything he needed to know. He met them in that same moment and felt a sudden, irrational jolt of panic.

"But you have no idea who could be behind it this time? Not even a guess?" It was the person who appeared to be Goyle who spoke this time, but the tone was off. Whether it was because of Harry's intervention or otherwise, he wasn't sure, but he could see where the conversation was headed as soon as Draco cast a glance in his direction and he was going to stop it.

"Well... there is Harry. That night in the common---"

"Stupefy!"

Harry reacted without thinking; panic had gripped him and his body had taken over. Red light blazed on the tip of Harry's wand and rocketed an inch past Draco's head before slamming into the chest of the person who was meant to be Goyle. They slumped from the armchair they had been sitting in and fell limply to the floor. Crabbe reached for his wand and tried to scramble to his feet, but Harry's wand was trained on him before he could make so much as a move.

Curses flashed through his mind, swift as the impressions he'd gotten when he had somehow performed Legilimency on the imposter he was sure had been Hermione Granger. The Cutting Curse, the Bludgeoning Curse, the Gouging Curse, the Blinding Curse Yaxley had tried to use against him, and so many others came to mind, but he hesitated.

Harry hesitated as the memory of blood flowing across a pale white coat of snow swam in front of his mind's eye. He hesitated at the memory of a boy screaming and clawing at his skull.

*"He is of no consequence. He was all too willing to leave me crippled for life and he had no role to play in what would come. The world was better off without him; he was of no value. I took no pleasure in what happened to him, but it has never kept me up at night. His incapacitation changed nothing that concerned me."*

Grindelwald had been all too willing to fire curses indiscriminately at those he cared naught for, but Harry needed to be different. A shiver still ran up his spine every time he thought about the way his thoughts had changed since Grindelwald had begun sharing his memories. He wasn't Grindelwald, he wasn't a murderer... he had to remind himself of that.

"Go!" he spat at Crabbe, whom he supposed was likely Weasley. "Get out or I'll curse you! I don't want to hurt you --- go!"

The boy did not need to be told twice. He muttered the incantation for the Levitating Charm and floated the unconscious form of Gregory Goyle out behind him.

Harry watched them go before turning to Draco, who was watching him with complete and total awe. "In the future," he said, "maybe watch your friends a bit more carefully and if they're acting completely different than normal. Maybe don't go and spew off a bunch of sensitive information." He shrugged. "Just food for thought, it might backfire on you next time."

He was halfway to the dorms when Draco's voice called after him. "Harry!" He turned and raised a single eyebrow.

Draco looked as though he wanted nothing more than to shrink back into the armchair he rested on, but he restrained the impulse and leant forwards. "Thanks for the help. I... didn't deserve it."

Harry just nodded, turned, and made his way back towards his dormitory. There was far too much on his mind for him to be thinking about how he felt regarding Draco and that whole situation. That was a mess he just did not need to revisit right now.

***January 1, 1993***

***Malfoy Manor***

***12:00 AM***

Harry could hear... something. It sounded almost like crazed chanting, but it was muffled... everything was muffled. He thought he could hear something more terrible, too. A high, agonized scream that seemed to come from everywhere but was drowned out. All around him was darkness and moving seemed next to impossible... until...

Pain wracked his body as something solid came up to meet him. The chanting ceased then and hurried footsteps echoed as they drew near to him. Nothing was muffled now and there was light, though it was dim.

He tried to struggle to his feet but he fell. His legs did not seem able to support his weight and his head seemed far too large... it was almost comical, like he wasn't human, but it was right --- he knew it was right.

He noticed something else as he tried feebly to stand once more. Aside from the stone he had impacted against, he was lying in something wet, red, and sticky.

Blood.

It was everywhere. He had not seen so much blood in... well, a touch over eleven years, he supposed. There was so much of it that it appeared as though the room had flooded with crimson water, but it smelled of blood. Its scent was overpowering and he almost choked on it before warmth enveloped him.

Harry felt himself lifted out of the blood as his perspective changed. Finally, he was at an appropriate vantage point. Blood was everywhere. It was thicker in some places, both around the woman's legs and where it had been used to draw runes of his own design. It splattered the floor in a great circle around the prone woman. She was still bleeding profusely, but Harry knew she was already dead.

Harry's misshapen lips curved upwards into a cruel smile as he opened his mouth to speak. The voice that escaped him was high and cold. Malice dripped from every syllable as he peered from the blonde woman holding his infant-sized body to the small cluster of men in black robes and white masks gathered all around them.

"My friends." His throat tore with the effort of speech but he persevered --- he would always persevere; he had beaten death, no pain on this Earth could halt him. "It has been so long, yet you alone stayed loyal. Your loyalty will be rewarded in time... when we craft the world anew." Something moved down below and Harry cast his eyes down towards the floor. It was a great serpent slithering around his carrier's heels and eyeing the still-bleeding corpse not far away. "**Nagini,**" he hissed, "**feast.**"

A scream tore free of Harry's lungs and rushed up his throat, screeching out of his mouth as he bolted upright before falling straight out of bed. The vomit rushed from him and drenched him; he was too weak to shift his head... his head, oh, Merlin, it burned! It burned as nothing had ever burned before. He could not even think of what had woken him through the pain. He knew nothing of the dark room or the high, cold voice. All he knew was pain and the dazed pondering of whether his scar would explode.

***Gryffindor Tower***

***10:31 AM***

Ron swerved hard and to the left in mid-air and the bludger sailed straight past him. There was something truly exhilarating about flying. Nothing else quite compared to the feeling of streaking unassisted through the sky. The pitch sprawled out far below them, so smooth and green that it could pass for an expanse of emerald sea.

The roar of the crowd was deafening. This was not Hogwarts, but a different, larger venue packed to capacity. The very air seemed to vibrate as the crowd's collective roar mounted and Ron caught a glimpse of gold from the corner of his eye and dove.

His robes whipped in the wind as he rocketed down towards the pitch. They were red like always, but the shade was different and he knew without looking that there was no lion on his chest, but a Union Jack.

The wind whistled in his ears so loudly that even the noise of the crowd seemed to dim, but Ron could still sense the opposing seeker nearby. He was actually closer to the snitch, but Ron knew he would get there first. His path was more direct and his movements more precise.

The crowd was truly in a frenzy now as Ron raced to the snitch. They could be heard again over even the whistling wind, but the sound they made was odd. Ron could distinguish no cheers or boos, just a sharp and persistent sound, almost like someone was knocking on a door.

Ron ignored them and their odd sounds --- they mattered naught to him. Not with victory so close. It was right there! Just another inch and he would have it! The other man was reaching, but he was too far away. Ron could feel his nails scrape uselessly against the back of his hand as he felt the cold metal against his palm and made to close his fingers... but Merlin, was that sound ever loud\...

"Ron! Ron! Are you there? Wake up!"

Ron jolted awake so fast that he sat bolt upright... and then immediately let out a loud cry of pain as he slumped back into bed.

It was unlike anything he had ever felt before. It was like his nerves were on fire. Every time he demanded something of them, the flames would roar and light them ablaze all over again. His muscles felt awful. It was like they had all been tied in painful knots. The ache was unbelievable. Jolting awake had been a miraculous burst of energy. When Ron tried to sit up once more, he found himself lacking the strength to do so.

"Ron!" the familiar voice called from the other side of the door to his dormitory. "Is everything okay?"

"I..." Even his voice sounded like it was in pain. It was a ragged, croak of a voice that struggled to tear free from the tight grip of Ron's constricted throat.

He heard the lock click then and the door swung open. "What's going on?" asked Hermione. "Ron, it's past ten and you said we were going to meet up an hour ago. What's---" she broke off then and her jaw fell open.

"What?" Ron managed to croak. "W-what's happened?"

"Ron... you look awful! What... what happened to you?"

"Happened?" Ron had only ever seen Hermione wear that expression once before. It had been seconds prior to his sacrifice in the magical chess game far beneath the castle last June. Something must really be wrong.

"You look pale as a ghost and you're shaking all over!" Ron had not noticed it until then, but she was right. Even when lying still, he trembled. But no... trembled wasn't the right word. Twitched would be more accurate. His muscles twitched of their own accord as if an electric current was ceaselessly streaming through his body.

He opened his mouth to respond, but nothing came out. Ron closed it again and resisted the urge to let his eyelids fall shut with it.

"Stay here," said Hermione, "something seems wrong. I'm going to get a professor!" She was gone as fast as she had appeared and Ron could do little more than stare vacantly out of the door she had just left.

***That night, in the Slytherin Common Room...***

Harry watched with keen interest as the returning students piled back into the common room after a long winter break. There was much bustling and even more chatter. The mood seemed light and weightless as freshly fallen snow, but Harry was less optimistic.

The last few days had been extremely hard on him. At first, he had suspected that Grindelwald may have sent him that final vision in retaliation for his demand that the former dark lord cease his efforts. The more Harry considered that theory, the less he believed it held any weight or value.

He had only vague memories of what he had seen, but what he remembered did not match the theme of Grindelwald's visions. Nothing about it made him think and everything Grindelwald had ever sent him had something captivating about it. The vision that had last woken Harry was different. It was just... grim. There was no more to it than that, sans the horrible pain that had greeted his stirring.

None of Grindelwald's visions had ever made him feel like that. It almost felt as though it was his scar that burned, but he knew that made no sense. Wherever the pain came from, it still lingered, if barely. That first day, it had been almost blinding and without rest. Now it was bearable; a barely noticeable prickle of discomfort every now and then. What was so interesting to Harry was that nothing he seemed to do mattered. No matter how much water he drank or how vehemently he avoided light, it persisted. The spikes of pain followed no observable pattern as far as he could tell. It seemed to have nothing to do with light or motion. Something about it just seemed... wrong.

But what was he to do? He would be laughed out of the hospital wing if he complained that his scar had been more painful than anything else he had ever felt. Madam Pomfrey would think he was mad and perhaps he was. Perhaps he had imagined the whole thing and Grindelwald had simply driven him to the point of insanity. Perhaps the pain in his skull was just a direct effect of remembering the pain Grindelwald had felt second-hand as he tore ruthlessly through the other student's mind.

The pain was less pressing now and he tried not to think of the final vision, or the one of Grindelwald tearing the boy's mind to shreds. Both of them made him nauseous in ways so different from one another. The conversation he had shared with Grindelwald... it warranted no further consideration.

What did require more attention was the fiasco on Yule. Students using polyjuice potion was a pretty big deal. Especially when those students --- infamous for wild and dangerous adventures --- had clearly been fishing for information. They had almost gotten it. Worse still, it had almost been his information. Had he not stepped in when he had, Harry was sure Weasley, Granger, and whoever else they told would by now have been aware that he was a Parselmouth and therefore the most obvious suspect in the mysterious case pertaining to the Heir of Slytherin.

Harry only knew one Hogwarts student capable of brewing potions as advanced as the one used in the common room. Well, perhaps others could have brewed it, but to think of it and know how it was made?

He watched Daphne Greengrass as she conversed with her group of friends. What was it she wanted? Was it possible she was aligned with Weasley and Granger? He remembered thinking back on what Snape had said about not only polyjuice potion, but yet another, equally illegal concoction.

*"Pathetic, all of you. The most powerful truth serum in the world is Veritaserum. It is a colourless, odourless liquid, which makes it ideal for subtle use..."*

The way he described Veritaserum was eerily similar to whatever had been put in Harry's pumpkin juice. He still had the liquid, poured from his goblet into a stoppered vial and stored in his trunk.

If it really had been Veritaserum, Greengrass clearly wanted something from him. Or to know something. Weasley and Granger had been fishing for information about the Heir of Slytherin. Harry had decided some time ago that Greengrass must have thought him the Heir and sought vengeance after Tracey's petrification. It was the only thing that made sense and if that was the case, her acting through others added up. Especially after Harry had gone and revealed himself as a Parselmouth to the rest of Slytherin House.

Greengrass must have felt his stare, for she looked at him and Harry felt a sharp stab of pain behind his eyes. It was not the same pain he had been feeling for days, but something different. Something that coincided with the momentary widening of Greengrass's eyes before she adopted a contemptuous expression.

Harry almost shivered. The older students had been a pain in his neck all year, but he suspected they would now leave him alone after the revelation that he shared their founder's gift. Daphne Greengrass would do no such thing and Harry privately thought she was more dangerous than all the upper-year bigots combined.

***Meanwhile, in the hospital wing...***

Ron gritted his teeth as another agonizing tremor wracked his body. The pain had eased some since Madam Pomfrey had forced a strange and foul-tasting liquid down his throat. Her expression while doing so had stuck in his mind. Never had he seen her look so worried. She looked almost panicked despite reassuring him all would be well and that there was nothing to worry about.

Hermione had returned soon after leaving his dormitory with Professor McGonagall in tow. She too had looked strangely concerned before conjuring him a stretcher and floating him down to the hospital wing. Finding the right potion to ease the pain had taken hours. The matron had tried vial after vial to no avail before deciding on the final one Ron had swallowed. Of course it had to be the foulest one that worked...

"Good evening, Master Weasley."

Ron almost leapt up --- or, tried to, at least --- when the new and vaguely familiar voice jolted him.

"P-Professor Dumbledore?"

"Dear me. I apologize for my suddenness in arriving. I suppose it must have caused quite the scare."

"It's... all right. Uh... should I call for Madam Pomfrey to get you a chair?"

Dumbledore smiled. "You're kind to offer, but there is no need." The old man slid a wand from his sleeve and gave it a casual flick, summoning a comfortable-looking armchair made from fine-looking leather from nowhere. "Here we are," said Dumbledore as he took his seat and interlocked his long, thin fingers. "You have given us all quite the scare today, if I may say so."

"Uh... sorry?"

"My dear boy, it is through no fault of your own. It is simply the truth."

Ron had no idea what Dumbledore meant. Given people a scare? Did this have something to do with the expressions worn earlier that day by the matron and Ron's Head of House?

"I... don't know what you're talking about, sir."

"Don't you?" asked Dumbledore with a deep frown. "May I ask you some questions, Master Weasley?"

"Uh... if you'd like."

"Thank you." Dumbledore leant slightly forward in his chair and Ron could swear the blue of his eyes had grown brighter in the dim light of the hospital wing. "Describe how you felt after waking this morning for me, if you would be so kind."

"Awful," Ron remembered with a shudder that sent a sharp shock of pain so violent through his body that he groaned aloud. Dumbledore sat patiently and waited, though he watched him very closely. "Everything ached. My muscles just wouldn't work; they felt so sore and weak, I could barely move."

"And you can remember nothing that would explain such pain?" Ron shook his head; he had felt perfectly fine last night and it wasn't as though he and Hermione had done anything interesting since their failed attempt to interrogate Malfoy in the Slytherin common room. "What was the pain like, exactly?"

"What was the pain like?"

"Yes. Was it a dull, throbbing pain? Or sharper; more like a stab or a violent shock?"

"More like that, yeah. It's... hard to explain. I've never felt anything like it before."

"No," mused Dumbledore, "I doubt you have. Tell me, Master Weasley, can you remember anything of note from the past few days? Anything from last night, in particular? Anything odd or out of the ordinary? Anything at all?"

"No," said Ron. "The last few days have been perfectly normal. I just remember going to bed last night, dreaming about Quidditch, and then waking up."

"Do you usually remember your dreams?" Ron had to think about that. It was such an odd question and had never been something he had considered. After a moment's pause, he shook his head. "I feared not," Dumbledore said as he ran a steady hand through his long, silver beard.

"Headmaster," started Ron, "what is all this about?"

"Discovering the truth," said Dumbledore.

"The truth?" asked Ron.

"Yes, the truth. People do not simply wake up with pain so intense they cannot move. Not without reason and not pain like that which you described."

"But... nothing happened."

"Nothing that you remember," Dumbledore corrected gently.

"What... what are you saying?"

Dumbledore reached up and slid his spectacles down over his nose to look at Ron more directly. "I am saying that I believe you were attacked and don't remember the event ever taking place."

Ron's eyes widened as his heart seemed to leap so violently into his throat that he thought it might spill from his mouth. "I... what? That's impossible! Why-why would anyone attack me?"

"That is the question, isn't it?"

"What did they do? Did they curse me? Or throw me down stairs, or something?"

"I believe I know what they did." The man's voice had become grim for the first time and Ron's heart quickened still more at the change in inflection.

"You do?"

"I think so, yes." Dumbledore sighed as Ron waited, shaking slightly, with an expectant look about him. "Master Weasley, has your father ever told you about the Cruciatus Curse?"

***January 9, 1993***

***The Dungeons***

***9:54 PM***

Harry had been grateful for the return of classes. They had served as a welcome distraction from all that ailed him at most hours of the day. He never thought he would wish for the upper years' attacks, nor Aberforth's cruel detentions, but he lamented having so much free time this past week.

He had done his best to make use of it. Large portions of his time had been spent sneaking off to abandoned classrooms to practice new magic. Curses, hexes, charms, and transfigurations all featured and Harry felt like he was really beginning to make steady progress in pulling far ahead of his peers.

Not that it helped him any time he duelled Cassie. The better he got, the more pressure she applied. Harry knew that he was improving fast, but it never felt like it while duelling Cassie. She was just miles better than he would be any time soon and it showed. He did take some comfort in the way Lord Malfoy had described her. If he was to be believed, she would be one of the very best duellists in Britain by the time she left Hogwarts. That at least gave him some hope that, one day, he might reach the level he sought. Being battered around as a second year by one of the best duellists in the nation was acceptable, he supposed.

This lesson had been especially brutal. Harry had pressed Cassie hard. He had a lot of pent-up frustration and the winter break had robbed him of time practicing. He was a touch spiteful and wished to make up for lost time. Pressing Cassie harder just meant that she retaliated in kind. Harry's body ached by the end of the practice, but it was the satisfied kind of ache that any who push themselves grow to appreciate.

"You're getting better," Cassie told him at their lesson's end. "You're improving faster than I ever would have imagined."

"Thanks. This year's shown me that I need to get better."

"You have. I doubt you would have taken it to Cadmus the way you did if you hadn't improved."

Harry felt heat rise up his body and take refuge in his cheeks. "I... uh, I'm sorry about that."

"No, you're not, nor should you be." She sighed and swept her long blonde hair over one shoulder. "Look, Cadmus is an arrogant toerag sometimes. I'm not blind; I can see that as well as anyone else. It was his decision to start that conflict. It's now up to him to live with the consequences."

"Fair enough," said Harry, blinking and unsure what else to say.

"If it happens again, expect the next practice to be brutal. Earned or not, I don't appreciate seeing my little brother hurt." Her words may have had a lightness to them, but Harry knew they were no joke and that she meant every word.

"I'll remember," he promised before leaving the room and beginning the trek back to the Slytherin common room.

Really, he ought to thank Cadmus Yaxley. The boy's stupidity had resulted in Harry revealing himself as a Parselmouth, which in turn seemed to have driven off all threats by the upper years. It was nice walking through a corridor without worrying what would jump out from behind the next tapestry or what spell he would need to shield against next.

Or so he thought, anyway.

Someone did indeed step out from behind the next tapestry and Harry raised his wand instinctively and prepared to cast a shield. When no spell came, he peered at his would-be assailant more closely. Her appearance surprised him far more than any curse could have done.

"Pansy?"

 "Evening, Harry."

It was odd how casually she greeted him. It wasn't as though they had spoken in the past three months.

Theodore had stolen away to join him in the library here and there, but Harry had scarcely interacted with Pansy past the odd stolen glance. It had been maddening. She had always offered something none of the others did and he had missed that immensely in the months following his falling out with Draco.

"What are you doing here?"

Pansy raised an eyebrow as she looked a bit up at him. "Is it so hard to believe I just want to catch up with a friend?"

"Draco's not watching you like a hawk? I'd have thought you might have tried to catch up earlier if he wasn't."

"He's been... different since we got back."

Harry actually frowned, beginning to walk back towards the Slytherin common room when Pansy gestured that they should do so. "Different how?"

"He's more... withdrawn. It seems like he's brooding, or thinking, or something. It's... odd. It's not like Draco to not spout off about whatever's on his mind."

It *was* odd of him. Harry could remember it happening before, but that had been during the scarce weeks in the fall of their first year. Looking back on it, Harry wondered whether Diana had spoken to him before each of those periods of time. They fell conveniently close to when Harry and the Malfoy heiress had spoken if his memory was serving him well.

*"The Malfoys might view you as a tool, but that doesn't mean all of us do."*

Daphne had betrayed him, but Harry had long since decided there was some truth in her words. How much there was had always been the question. Had Diana lectured Draco because she cared, or had it all been a ploy to maintain his friendship with Harry? He wanted to believe otherwise. Diana had been the most reliable person he had known since entering the magical world. Losing her like he had lost Draco would be pain past what he feared he could bear.

"That is weird," Harry admitted, "is he sick or something?"

"He's fine," said Pansy, "just sulky."

"So he's not paying as close attention to you lot?"

Pansy scoffed. "I doubt he knows where we are half the time."

"Does this mean I can expect more drop-ins from Theodore?"

Pansy huffed. "How am I supposed to know?"

"Isn't knowing people kind of your thing?"

"I know people and usually how they feel. That doesn't mean I know what they're going to do. How am I supposed to know how boys' brains work?"

"Yeah, I guess that would be tough for you. I bet it's hard to imagine someone thinking about more than shoes or makeup."

Pansy swatted at him, but Harry stepped aside and laughed. "You're a prat," she chastised, but Harry saw she could not withhold her smile.

"Then you have bad taste in friends."

"What was your first clue?

"Draco and I. A pouty brat and the so-called Heir of Slytherin." He could feel the atmosphere change when he said it. He peered at Pansy, who suddenly looked pensive. "Do you actually think I'm the Heir?"

"No," she answered at once, "but I think you're *an* heir."

Harry frowned. "What do you mean *an* heir?"

"You can speak to snakes, Harry. The only people who can do that are Salazar Slytherin's descendants." She looked at him pointedly. "I don't think you're going around petrifying people, but I think you could if you wanted to --- and if you found the chamber."

"You actually think it's the Heir of Slytherin then? Not some older student using some obscure curse?"

"I doubt it. If it was a curse, Dumbledore would have set them right by now. He's a sodding twat, but he's brilliant with magic. I doubt even Draco's father would deny that."

They were drawing near to the common room now. The smooth stone wall loomed ahead like the way the face of a mountain might welcome an incoming hang glider looking for a perch to land atop.

"You go ahead. I'll walk a loop of the dungeons and come back."

Harry nodded. "Thanks, Pansy. It... was really nice talking to you again."

"We'll have to make it happen more often," she waved and was gone as Harry stepped inside the common room.

There was quite the commotion inside. Not even his entrance had quelled the noise and it had been doing that ever since he had animated snakes and set them against Cadmus Yaxley. The students all appeared to be congregated around the wall on which notices and the like were usually held.

"I'll save you the effort," said Diana, walking up to him with Cassius and Cassie flanking her on either side. "They're hosting another duelling club meeting in three weeks."

***That night...***

Harry leant back against the wall of warmth that cradled him in its arms. The rocking motions were smooth and pleasant and he could feel his eyelids growing heavy as whoever held him hummed melodically in a somewhat familiar voice. A softly crackling fire blazed in the hearth and he could see Nagini coiled at his caretaker's feet.

The effort of keeping his eyes open had just become unbearable when there came a knock from the warm room's door and the woman holding him called out in a colder, less pleasant tone of voice.

"Enter."

The door opened and a blond-haired man in immaculate robes stepped inside. Harry could see his eyes widen with something that looked like worry from under his own, half-closed eyes.

"If our lord is asleep, I'll return---"

"There is no need, Lucius," Harry said in a high, cold voice that threatened to crack on each and every syllable. "I am awake."

The man hastened to kneel and bow his head. "I apologize, my lord. I did not mean to presume otherwise."

"Rise," Harry commanded and the man stood to his feet once more. "What brings you to me?"

"The sample has been secured, my lord."

Harry felt a rush of excitement greater than any he had felt in more than a decade, minus the day he had been reborn. "Show me."

The man reached a hand into the pocket of his robes and withdrew a clear vial filled to the brim with a crimson liquid Harry recognized at once. He needed not smell the vial's contents to know that it was blood. He had spilled enough of it in his time to distinguish the liquid from sight alone.

"Very good," said Harry. "All went smoothly then, I take it?"

"Yes, my lord. No one is aware."

"Good. See that it stays that way."

"Of course, my lord."

"Leave me," said Harry, leaning back against the woman's chest as he smiled a thin smile. She was wonderfully warm, even if he detested the way she held him so protectively. He should not need to be protected.

It mattered naught. Soon, the need for such farces would pass. Only one more step still needed to be taken. It was the most difficult of all, but he would see it through. He would see through anything necessary if it meant he could reclaim what had once been his.

***The Headmaster's Office***

***9:14 PM***

Tonight had been one of Harry's worst nights in Occlumency practice. Dumbledore had sat as stoic as ever, but Harry knew that there was no way the old man was not aware of his lapse this evening. Those deep blue eyes seemed to see everything. They saw through flesh and bone and seemed to pull truths from one's very soul. Harry had never sat before a man with a stare as unnerving as the headmaster's --- despite how warm it appeared.

"I believe that will do," said Dumbledore, relaxing in his high-backed chair and inspecting Harry with a critical air. "What ails you, Harry?"

Damned Gryffindors. For all his brilliance, Dumbledore was oftentimes as blunt and straightforward as any other Gryffindor Harry had ever met. It was off-putting sometimes. How could Dumbledore go from impassive and calculating to... this? From a chess grandmaster to a concerned old man in the blink of an eye. Dumbledore was truly an oddity, elsewise he was extremely good at playing both sides or had begun to suffer from multiple personality disorder in his old age.

Harry pondered whether or not to speak. The memories sent by Grindelwald were protected under a binding magical contract. Harry couldn't share any of those, even if he wanted to.

But the other visions...

He was sure that the more recent visions had not been sent by Grindelwald but by another. Harry could speak about them, but did he want to? Dumbledore would surely think he was mad. One did not just claim to have dreams like what Harry had last experienced.

"It's nothing," he said, keeping his face as impassive as ever.

"No," said Dumbledore, "it is not." He leant forward in his chair once again. "I will not attempt to convince you to share your secrets with me, but I would like a reason as to why you wish to withhold them."

"I don't think you would believe me." There was no other way to describe it. No lie Harry would have been able to come up with would convince Albus Dumbledore in such a short period of time.

Dumbledore interlocked his fingers as he peered intently over his half-moon spectacles. "And why is that, if I may ask?"

"It... seems impossible. Most people would just think I was going mad."

"Allow me to dissuade any fears you may have. I do not think you are going mad, no matter what ails you. There is nothing you could tell me that would convince me otherwise."

Harry could refuse. Dumbledore had said himself he would not be pushing for information, but was it worth it? The old man may well glean it one day from peering inside Harry's mind. Perhaps it was better to speak now and ask Dumbledore's opinion on the matter.

"I've... had a couple of dreams lately that have bothered me."

Dumbledore raised an eyebrow. "May I presume these have been out of the ordinary in some way?"

"They're... hard to explain. I don't remember them perfectly, but... they're different."

"Different how?"

Harry wrung his hands as he tried to decide how to begin explaining. "I'm not me in the dreams. I'm... someone else. I see everything through their eyes, I hear their thoughts... I am them."

Something flashed in Dumbledore's eyes. It was gone so fast that Harry had no hope of identifying it, but it had been there. "That is rather odd, yes," the old man said quietly. "May I ask whose mind you occupy in these dreams?"

"I... don't know. They've never said."

"But you believe you have the answer," Dumbledore prompted gently.

Harry nodded slowly, but swallowed hard once he realized that Dumbledore was waiting for him. He took a deep, centring breath as he braced himself for the rebuke, the chastisement, or even the accusations of falsehood.

"Voldemort."

The name was spoken in barely more than a whisper but every syllable seemed to echo through the office. Many of the portraits depicting former headmasters and headmistresses who had been pretending to sleep a moment earlier jolted at the name.

Harry paid them no heed. He watched Dumbledore's face for a reaction as the room seemed to cool. One was there, but it was not what he had expected. The lines in the old man's face had deepened. To Harry, it looked as though the Chief Warlock had aged by a decade right before his very eyes.

"I had suspected as much, yes."

Harry's eyes widened. "You knew?!"

"Oh, no, I assure you my assumptions were made loosely and based on many unproven theories."

"But... you'd guessed?"

"I did," the old man admitted. "I have suspected for some time that you and Lord Voldemort share a unique and mysterious connection."

"What kind of connection?" asked Harry, his heartbeat quickening as his breaths laboured. He did not wish to share a connection with Voldemort. The one Grindelwald had forged was troublesome enough on its own and Harry had even cut that link off.

Dumbledore watched him very closely for a moment. His expression was more of a blank slate than Harry had ever seen it before. It was like he was pondering something very deeply.

"The night Lord Voldemort sought to kill you," Dumbledore began, "he used an especially dangerous curse. The spell works in a way so unique that there is no hope of replicating anything like it. Its arithmetic equation stands as a logical fallacy, for the spell does something that violates the very laws of nature and should not at all be possible."

"Sir, I don't mean to be rude, but what does that have to do with me? We talked about this before, too. When you asked if I could speak to snakes."

"And just like then, the importance is in the magic, not in you. For all the masses' talk of special powers that the rest of us mere mortals knew not, it was a unique set of circumstances that allowed you to survive that night."

"My mother's sacrifice?"

"Precisely. It was the only thing that could have stopped that spell from killing you, but such magic is not so easily defeated. It will find a way to do the damage it was called forth to wrought. Magic like that leaves marks that will never truly fade."

"Like Parseltongue?"

"Like Parseltongue, yes."

"Wait!" Harry raised a shaky hand and pressed a finger to his infamous lightning bolt scar. "Do you mean---"

"Your scar, yes. It marks the place where Voldemort's spell touched you." Dumbledore stroked his long, silvery beard. "Tell me, has your scar ever bothered you or acted in a way that normal scars should not?"

"After the dreams... my head... I'd never felt anything like it. It hurt worse than anything I've ever felt after the first one. The only thing that felt close to it was when I touched Quirrell last June. I... I thought it felt like the pain came from my scar, but that made no sense."

"It is likely that the pain does come from there, yes."

"Last year," Harry remembered, "when I was in Defence Against the Dark Arts or..."

"When you were otherwise around the spirit of Lord Voldemort," Dumbledore finished. "You would feel similar sensations to the one you are describing now?"

"Yeah, I'd forgotten all about that." He looked almost pleadingly towards the headmaster with wide, emerald eyes. "Sir... does this mean---"

"That you are not imagining things? No, Harry, I do not believe you are. In fact, I am quite sure of it, though I wish I could say otherwise. I think you being a Parselmouth confirms the connection all on its own."

"Why? What does it all mean?"

"It... could mean nothing."

"But you don't think so?" Harry pressed, borrowing Dumbledore's own probing technique from earlier that evening.

"I do not," the old man admitted with a sigh. "It is apparent that your scar reacts any time you find yourself too near Lord Voldemort. Physical contact last June seemed unimaginably painful." Harry shuddered at the memories of what he'd felt before blackness had claimed him.

"Well, yeah," said Harry, "but I haven't been near Voldemort all school year."

"You have not, which is troubling if your scar has plagued you so. Though I do believe I have an answer that might explain what is happening." There was a dark look about Dumbledore's eyes that Harry did not like.

"What do you think is happening, sir?"

"I think that Voldemort's power is growing. I think that last year, as a wraith, there was only so much power his existence held over you. That is why it took physical proximity to trigger the connection."

Harry felt a shiver run up his spine at the implications of what Dumbledore was saying. "You think he's gotten more powerful since the end of last year?"

"I think it is very possible. Voldemort has always had and will always have his supporters. He may well have contacted some of them last year whilst masquerading as Professor Quirrell. He still showed himself to be sharp as ever and if I know Voldemort, being so close to regaining the power he once held will only drive him further."

"What does more powerful mean, Professor? He can't come back without a body, can he? But he can't have a body, right?"

"I don't know," Dumbledore said with a tight expression. "I certainly think he can, but I doubt he has a body in the sense that you are thinking. I imagine there would be some signs if he had regained his full power. No, I think it more likely he is somewhere between where he was when we last saw him and where he wishes to be. Powerful enough that the connection between the two of you is awakening and expanding, but not powerful enough to be an immediate threat we must hasten to contain."

"What do you mean by awaken and expand?"

"You have told me that last year, you felt pain only when in direct proximity to Voldemort?" Harry nodded. "That is not the case anymore, as we now know." Dumbledore's stare seemed to become even more intense if such a thing was possible. Harry swore he felt the weight of it pinning him to the back of his chair. "What can you tell me about what you dreamt while occupying Lord Voldemort's mind?"

"I... don't exactly remember. Blood... a lot of blood. The first time... it was confusing. Everything was dark until it wasn't and then... more blood than I've ever seen before."

"You say you felt what he felt? How did it feel to see through his eyes?"

"Like I had just caught the snitch or something," Harry said with a pained grimace. "It... felt happy. Like something incredible had just happened."

Dumbledore nodded stoically. "And the second dream?"

Harry turned the memory over and over in his mind. It was foggier and more difficult to decipher. "I... Voldemort was in a chair or something. He was sitting on something because he could look down and see the floor, and the snake, and the---"

"The snake?" cut in Dumbledore.

"Er... yeah, there was a snake."

"Very well, carry on."

"He could see all of that from his position; he must have been sitting. Someone else was there, too. Maybe more than one person. They kept calling him 'my lord' and they said... they said something about a sample and Voldemort seemed happy again. It... was like the first time, but different. Not as strong, but more..." he shook his head; it was impossible to put the emotions into words.

Dumbledore's fingers had unlaced themselves at some point during Harry's retelling and were now drumming upon the surface of his desk. He seemed to be pondering for a moment in the oppressive stillness of the room. The portraits had given up trying to feign sleep, but none of them so much as moved. It was like they were frozen in place or else unwilling to disturb the tension hanging like precipitation in the vast, circular tower.

"What does it mean?" Harry asked again when he could no longer bear the pause. "I don't get it! What am I seeing? Why am I seeing it?"

"You are seeing through Lord Voldemort's eyes just as he sees it."

"So... that all actually happened?"

"I think so, yes. The why is more complex, but I would hazard a guess and say that whenever Voldemort feels particularly powerful emotions, the link between the two of you becomes more active. It is likely that he has no idea of its existence. I am sure he would never willingly provide you such insights into his mind if he knew."

"How do I stop it?" Harry asked. His heart had leapt upwards into his throat at the revelation that he really had been living parts of Voldemort's life. Grindelwald had been bad enough, but at least that had been somewhat consensual on both sides. This was different. It felt... dirty.

"Occlumency," the Headmaster answered simply. "There is no other way. You must continue improving. One day, you will be able to repel such attacks on your mind whether they are deliberate or not." He looked away from Harry for the first time in what felt like an age to study the odd clock hanging on his wall. "For now, I believe this conversation has stretched on long enough. Do not allow yourself to become too troubled. Rest is all you can do for now. More will come in due time."

Harry hated it; he hated all of it. It was just like the end of first year. Just like how Dumbledore had told him he would know why Voldemort had come for him, but only when he was ready. It was maddening. All of it was maddening. Voldemort, Grindelwald, Dumbledore... he felt like a ball being thrown back and forth between the three of them and he was sick of it.

Harry felt the haze of anger break when a soft note played through the room. The Headmaster's prized phoenix had let out a long and haunting trill and Harry's overwhelming feelings of anger, sorrow, and helplessness had dissipated all at once. It had actually been disconcerting, but as he took to his feet and made for the door, Harry thought he much preferred this kind of disconcerting to whatever the hell the rest of his year had been.

***January 23, 1993***

***The Knight's Room***

***8:00 PM***

There was a certain gravity to this meeting that Ron had never experienced before. There had been tense gatherings, sure, but nothing quite like this.

His short stint in the hospital wing had become public knowledge within hours of his arrival. What had been less known was exactly how he had wound up there. A small mercy it was, for he feared to imagine what the school would have done with the knowledge that somebody walking its halls was proficient with both the Memory Charm and the Cruciatus Curse.

That fact was disturbing enough for Ron, let alone everyone else. He had spent many hours locked up in abandoned classrooms discussing with Hermione who the culprit could have been and what on earth they might have wanted.

Ron thought it had to be the Heir of Slytherin. Who else would traipse about Hogwarts casually throwing around Unforgivable Curses? He had never heard of anything like this happening in the castle despite all his brothers' collective experiences.

Hermione had taken a more logical approach.

*"It's all well and good to be able to cast the spells,*" she had said, *"but why would the Heir want to torture you? You're a pureblood. Besides, there's no rule that says only one person with dark plans can wander around the halls at night."*

Ron's only real counter to that had been that perhaps the Heir had wanted retribution for trying to track down their identity. Hermione had unfortunately bit back with something rather difficult to argue against.

*"If the Heir of Slytherin was worried about you catching onto them, why wouldn't they have just petrified you like the others? That way, you couldn't go around talking."*

It was all a mess. This entire damn school was a mess. So much for his parents' preaching about Hogwarts being the safest place in the world. Not even Professor Dumbledore had been able to protect the castle from the wrathful grasp danger seemed to have held on it for the better part of the last two years.

Ron really would have liked to come up with some answers before facing Cedric, Susan, and Hannah. Their expectant glances upon his entrance were as crushing as a speeding bludger. Ron had known they would be there, but it did not make being subjected to them any more pleasant.

He had contemplated lying about what had happened or trying to fabricate some kind of story, but he was a miserable liar. His and Hermione's confidence in their own subtlety also wasn't exactly at an all-time high after the fiasco that had been their failed intrusion upon the Slytherin common room the night of Yule.

Cedric, Susan, and Hannah listened with rapt attention as Ron recapped all that had happened from the time he awoke to the time Dumbledore had finished speaking with him that night in the hospital wing. A part of him thought the three Hufflepuffs wouldn't believe him, but he could see at once that was not the case.

*"You might belong in Hufflepuff,*

*Where they are just and loyal,*

*Those patient Hufflepuffs are true*

*And unafraid of toil..."*

Just and loyal was certainly one way to put it. As for unafraid... Ron thought reckless might have been more apt, but he was hardly in a position to pass judgement after how his first year had ended.

"You have no idea who did it?" asked Susan.

Ron and Hermione exchanged glances. "None," said the latter.

Ron tried not to make a face, but judging by Cedric's narrowed eyes, he had failed. He was less sure than Hermione they did not already have a culprit.

The way their probing of Malfoy had been allowed to continue for so long but had been forcefully halted the second Potter was brought into the equation. The way he had systematically taken the two of them apart before sending them packing. The look in his eyes as Ron had retreated --- it had not seemed a stretch then to imagine him petrifying students, or worse.

Hermione's biggest sticking point was that a second-year student had no way of knowing anything like the Cruciatus Curse. Ron had no strong counterpoints, but when had the rules ever applied to Potter? If he had survived the Killing Curse before his second birthday, why was it impossible he knew dark and vile curses before the age of thirteen?

"There's no point stewing on it for now," said Cedric, pulling Ron from his thoughts with a sudden jolt much like the one that had awoken him that fateful morning almost three weeks earlier. "All we can do is our best to make sure nothing like that can happen again."

They all nodded as they raised their wands, but for the first time since Neville's death, the shadow of doubt loomed over Ron as he tried to escape from its oppressive clutches. If there were students in the school capable of such advanced magic, how were they ever to match them in time?

***January 30, 1993***

***The Great Hall***

***8:57 PM***

Harry felt the somewhat familiar rush of excitement when his opponent crumpled to the floor, hit with a Stunner that had slipped through their defences. The boy had been fast and aggressive, but sloppy. He overextended his wand movements and put himself out of position with footwork that just tried to do too much. It had been an interesting duel due to the boy's unorthodox style, but not an overly competitive one. Really, the only competitive duel Harry had faced had been against the red-headed terror who had summoned the snake back during the duelling club's first official meeting.

This gathering was far more organized. Duels had not devolved into playground brawls this time around and the pairs seemed more evenly matched --- in most cases. Harry had managed to spot Cassie standing alone with her opponent seemingly unconscious on the floor. He knew first-hand exactly how lethal she was and he did not envy any of the poor sods Aberforth kept pairing up with her.

The final spells of dying duels faded as Aberforth gruffly cleared his throat and prepared to speak but before he could, a louder, more unexpected noise tore through the still room and caused the floor beneath their feet to shake.

"What the hell was that?" someone asked.

"It came from above!"

"Listen!" called another. There was a sound that was getting louder and louder. Harry thought for a moment it was directly connected to whatever had just happened, but he didn't realize until some time after that it was just Peeves. He was singing madly as he flew straight through all the floors between them and where he had been, singing about destruction and lost trinkets all the while.

"The trophy room," said an upper-year Ravenclaw girl with blonde hair and blue eyes. "The bit about the lost trinkets --- whatever we just heard must have happened in the trophy room."

Aberforth seemed to believe her. His wand was drawn like a sword a moment later as he made for the door, unwillingly leading a procession of several hundred students in his wake.

Something felt wrong to Harry. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end as goosebumps rose all along his arms. Something was wrong here; he could not explain how he knew, he simply did.

Yet what was he to do? He had been swept up in the mob of students making their hasty exits to follow in Aberforth's wake. The man himself had barely spared any of them a glance. The only distraction he had allowed himself had been to conjure a large, silvery something and send it streaking out of the room ahead of him.

Harry allowed himself to be led away by the crowd, but his eyes lingered on the Great Hall as long as they could.

***Minutes later, on the third floor...***

Diana had been following the crowd just like everyone else when she had seen her. The girl's platinum-blonde hair stood out stark as shining stars against the inky blackness of the night sky and she was dressed... eccentrically. What exactly was hanging from her ears, Diana had no idea, but she found she did not much care. All that mattered was that she sought to do what had to be done. Whether it took a day, a week, a month, or the rest of the school year.

The girl stood alone and a fair distance away from her nearest classmates. She was short and had a frail sort of look about her. One breeze appeared as though it might be forceful enough to sweep this girl away like the last vestiges of summer fleeing the north on a south-bound wind.

"Miss Lovegood," said Diana, "it's a pleasure to meet you."

The girl looked startled for a moment. The girl's eyes were almost comically wide. They were among the brightest things in the corridor as they shone silver in the relatively dim lighting.

"Hello," said Lovegood. "You're alone. I see you with friends all the time." She frowned. "I don't have many of those. If you've lost one, you might do better asking someone else."

Diana blinked several times. This had not been what she had expected. It was well-known that Xenophilius Lovegood was an odd fellow, but this was something different altogether. The daughter of a man who owned a newspaper so... open. And not open like most people --- open in a way that suggested her brain just didn't think better of any words that slid onto the tip of her tongue.

"I... haven't, thank you."

"Oh," said Luna Lovegood in a sing-song kind of voice. "Well, that's nice. It's not nice to lose anything. I've been losing things all year."

Diana peered at her through skeptical eyes. Part of her thought this young girl had to be playing some kind of joke or trick. Perhaps she might have chalked it up to a facade if she had been older, but she was convinced that no eleven-year-old girl could put on a mask of this nature in such a convincing manner.

"I'm... sorry to hear about your year," Diana said with a smile that managed to form on her face right in the nick of time. "You're Xenophilius Lovegood's daughter, aren't you?"

"That's right," said the girl, bobbing her head in an odd, discombobulated variant of a nod.

Diana held out her hand. "My father has been wanting to meet yours for a long time, so I thought I would check in on you while I had the chance. I'm Diana, Heiress of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Malfoy."

Luna hummed. "I don't think Daddy's ever mentioned your father."

It was fortunate that her father had chosen Diana for this task and not Draco. He would surely have lost patience with this girl already. That last comment about their father would have done him in had nothing else before quite managed it.

"Yes, well, your father is quite busy and doesn't seem to attend Wizengamot meetings."

"Of course he doesn't," she said as though it was the most obvious thing in the world. "The Wizengamot only meets on blue moons and to discuss ways to hide the pact between the mermen and the centaurs."

"The... what?"

"You haven't heard of it?"

"I... can't say I have."

"Hm, well, I guess they're doing a good job, then. Shame. Daddy's wanted to do a piece on it in his newspaper for ages."

Diana felt the crowd pressing her back the way they had come. She had not been near the front of the queue and therefore had no idea what Aberforth had found in the trophy room. Judging by the uniform drone of grumbling voices, nothing; or nothing that was of any real interest.

Now the crowd was moving again and Diana felt herself pulled along with them, though she noticed that the Lovegood girl was still beside her. Good, she thought, solving this particular puzzle was going to take much longer than she had anticipated.

***Soon after, back on the first floor...***

The further away the crowd had drawn from the Great Hall, the more and more nervous Harry had become. He couldn't be sure why. There had been nothing back in the Great Hall, yet Harry somehow felt compelled to return there. No sinister student or mysterious monster had awaited them in the trophy room and finally, the large crowd had begun making its way back downstairs.

Harry's heart beat faster with every footstep of his that echoed off the flagstone floor as they reached the castle's ground level once more. He glanced around to watch the others, but no one else seemed troubled by what was taking place.

Perhaps he really was mad, no matter what Dumbledore said. Or perhaps his instincts knew something the others' didn't. He hoped this was false, but he feared that wasn't the case and as they drew near to the Great Hall once more, Harry's suspicions were swiftly confirmed.

The first thing he noticed was the writing on the wall. It was done in a dark, crimson colour that looked and smelt unmistakably of blood. The writing was still wet and it dripped and seeped down the wall, falling in small droplets to break against the floor several feet below. It was difficult to see what was written despite the flamboyance of the message, for many taller, wider bodies blocked Harry's line of sight.

Yet something else had stunned the crowd into silence that Harry had not yet seen. Many of the mutters died and were replaced by shocked and horrified silence. A couple of girls actually screamed. People began shoving one another to get away --- Harry even saw one girl faint. The crowd had descended into complete and total madness.

Not that Harry was complaining. It allowed him to move closer to the writing on the wall and read it for the first time.

*Even the queens of the jungle must one day lay before their lord and master.*

Harry read the words three times but did not understand them --- not until he glanced downwards.

Lying face-up beneath the words was a figure wearing straight black robes. Despite her plain attire, it was not at all difficult to recognize her. Her lips --- usually pulled in a stern line of disapproval --- were slightly parted and halfway through forming an exclamation of some kind.

"Merlin," Harry heard an older student mutter from nearby, "the bastard got Professor McGonagall."

***The Headmaster's Office***

***9:15 PM***

Albus Dumbledore did not often indulge himself, but tonight he slowly poured yet another glass of oak-matured mead as he awaited his guest. He thought the mead was Madam Rosmerta's finest offering, and by Merlin could he use it.

One could not tell the time by looking outside. It was a dark night filled with bitter cold and surging snowfalls. Albus could hear the wind ripping at the side of the castle, causing the glass panes in his office window to shutter softly against its surging onslaught. Flakes of white snow came down from the sky in thick flurries. Some of them splattered against the window or castle walls, but more still fell and blanketed the ground far below. It was difficult to tell from a glance, but the flakes appeared heavier than usual.

Albus did not need to glance to the clock to know what time it was, though it felt much later. As he'd aged, days seemed to blur by and lifetimes seemed to pass as student after student passed through the halls of Hogwarts, but this day had felt like an entire year all on its own.

What was he to do now? The attacks had moved well beyond what they had been fifty years ago. No longer were they random assaults on outspoken muggleborns. Now, they were targeted strikes against some of the most prominent members of the castle. Today's had certainly sent a strong message.

Minerva was as gifted as anyone. Whatever dwelled in the Chamber of Secrets must have been immensely powerful to have overwhelmed her so utterly and while leaving no signs of a struggle. It made Albus's heart race as he pondered what it could be and whether he himself might be next.

It was an interesting thought. Tom had always steered clear of him when possible. Even during the Purity War, he had only ever engaged with him when Albus himself had forced his hand. Even then, it had been swift and ended with a tactical retreat at the first available opportunity. He was no fool. Tom was not afraid of him and he was not delusional enough to think that was the case, but he had always been wary and grudgingly harboured a healthy respect.

Yet this was perhaps Tom's best chance. Unleashing something on him he didn't know the identity of was the greatest opportunity he would ever have to dispatch of him. On the other hand, chaos would descend upon the castle if that were to happen, and Tom knew it. Even in his darkest hour, Albus knew Tom would never do anything that could close the castle's doors forever. That had been one weakness he had always been able to count upon.

It was reassuring to know that any incarnation of Tom would think this way, for it was difficult to know exactly what he was dealing with. He could not see how Tom was doing all of this from so far away. Perhaps he had ensured the loyalty of another last year, or perhaps... no. He would know if Tom had gone so far. There was no way that could happen without his knowledge.

There came a knock on the door and Dumbledore called for his guest to enter. Severus looked as calm as ever as he strode forward and took the chair across from him.

"You look tired," Snape said by way of an introduction.

"I certainly feel tired. It has been a long and trying day. I don't suppose the search of the castle turned up anything of note?"

"No. We have enlisted the house elves' assistance, but they have been no more successful than the rest of us."

"A clever ploy nonetheless. I thank you, Severus, and I apologize for what must come next."

"What must come next?"

"You know the position you must fill now?"

"Deputy Headmaster. I am ecstatic for the extra paperwork, I assure you." His face twisted into that trademarked scowl. "Why you insist upon labouring me with the position when Flitwick has been teaching at this institution since I was a boy, I will never understand."

"Oh, I think you understand just fine. You may simply be unprepared to admit it to yourself." Snape said nothing as he stared blankly back across the desk, his black eyes seeming to swallow all the dim light that flowed through the room. "There will come a time when I am no longer wanted here."

"They may try to remove you," Snape acknowledged.

"I fear they may well be successful. This has moved beyond strikes on muggleborns. The purebloods' attention will be drawn now that a professor has been attacked. I don't know who the assailant may target next, but a couple more influential strikes and I imagine my tenure at the castle will be at its end for a time."

"For a time?"

"Yes, for a time. They may remove me, but I have no plans of staying removed."

Snape dipped his head, though his expression stayed neutral. "And you still don't know who is behind these attacks?"

"I suspect I know who has facilitated them, but I am as out of ideas as anyone as to who is carrying them out."

"Who was behind them last time?" Snape sneered. "How they could ever have imagined *Hagrid* capable of such things---"

"Yes, it was quite ridiculous to think a man as compassionate and kind-hearted as Rubeus would do anything so heinous." Snape's lip curled at the deflection, but he said nothing.

"It was a boy," Albus said at last. "A prefect from your house who was in his fifth year. Tall and pale, he commanded the attention of all in the day whilst he traipsed about the shadows at night."

"You are sure it was him?"

"I am."

"And you believe it is him again." It was the first time Snape's expression had changed, sans his scowl. His lips had pressed together and there was an intense look in those dark, unnerving eyes.

"Any other answer would be too great a coincidence." The two men sat in silence for a moment; the only sounds in the room were the deep, sleeping breaths of the former headmasters and headmistresses in their frames and the softly crackling fire still burning in the hearth.

Snape conjured a glass and reached for the bottle of mead without prompting. The sound of pouring liquid filled the room. They could have been camping in the wilderness, what with the fire and a sound that could pass for running water.

"He is coming back," Snape said after a long pull from the glass.

Dumbledore sighed but nodded as he himself reached to refill his own drink. "Yes, I believe so."

"The mark has begun to burn again. Not hot enough for a summons, but more painfully than it has since he failed to kill Potter."

"How long has this been happening?"

"For the better part of a month. Two times in particular I had feared he may truly have returned."

Two times the mark had burned red-hot... two times Harry had shared a mind with Voldemort...

*"...but I would hazard a guess and say that whenever Voldemort feels particularly powerful emotions, the link between the two of you becomes more active."*

It was not surprising, but it was troubling.

"I believe that on both occasions, he did at least take significant steps towards a return to power."

Snape's eyes narrowed. "How is it you have come by that assumption?"

"Harry has dreamt of him. His memories are vague, but what he described of the first dream he had sounded to me like some kind of dark and twisted ritual."

"Potter... dreamt of him?"

"He did."

"And... you place stock in these dreams?"

"I do not believe that they are dreams at all. Visions would be more apt."

"I see no reason to assume that Potter, of all people, is a seer."

"Nor do I. Need I remind you how hesitant I was to allow Divination to be taught here at all?" Snape's expression darkened but he shook his head jerkily.

Albus took to his feet. The tumultuous surge of thoughts and emotions had become too much to bear whilst sitting still as Minerva lay in the hospital wing. His precious phoenix let out a soft trill as Fawkes lifted his head and Albus felt the load upon him lessen some. He paid the bird a passing smile before he came to stand near the window that overlooked a large portion of the Hogwarts grounds.

"Harry shares a unique connection with Lord Voldemort," he said after a time. "I have suspected it for some time, but I am sure of it now."

"A... connection? With the Dark Lord?"

"The Killing Curse touches the very soul. That kind of twisted magic is not so easily defeated."

"Does this... connection pose any threat to the boy?" Snape asked, slowly and clearly enunciating each and every syllable.

"Not yet, but in time, that may change. There is little to be done for now. We have our own pressing set of circumstances we must attend to."

"I suppose that we do," Snape agreed as Dumbledore moved to retake his seat. There was something different about Snape's eyes. A vacant air about them that had not been there before.

Good, Albus thought. If that was what it took to make Severus understand how dire things could swiftly become, then so be it.

***February 14, 1993***

***The Great Hall***

***8:46 AM***

Harry knew something was wrong even before he entered the Great Hall. Valentine's Day had arrived with none of the splendour he remembered from the previous year. The walls had been luridly decorated and the suits of armour had been utilized. There was none of that now. Just an unmistakable air of tension the second he entered the Great Hall for breakfast.

Well, a tenser air than usual, he supposed. Moving about the castle had felt like navigating a minefield as of late. Everyone was on edge after Professor McGonagall had been petrified. It was one thing when the victim was an annoying first-year muggleborn. It was another altogether when it was an esteemed professor who had served at the school for decades. McGonagall would have been labelled as untouchable if Harry had been forced to categorize her, and would have been near the very bottom of any list of potential targets he could have drawn up.

Rita Skeeter's article had not helped matters. She had finally begun covering the Chamber of Secrets and the attacks at Hogwarts. A part of Harry wondered why she hadn't done so earlier. Perhaps attacks on a couple of unknown students and a cat just weren't enough to attract her attention, or perhaps students hadn't felt the need to spread the word over the winter break.

All of that had changed the day after Professor McGonagall had been found petrified. It had been front-page news --- a bold headline splattered across a vivid depiction of the Slytherin House emblem. Skeeter had also promised to get to the bottom of things. From the little Harry knew about the woman, that could only mean a great deal of trouble. He just hoped that whatever she did, she did not decide to take up arms with the Gryffindors and paint him as Lord Voldemort's heir apparent.

Gryffindor House had taken its leader's downfall very poorly. They wrought all sorts of misery upon Slytherins any chance they could. Harry, in particular, had become something akin to the house's punching bag these past two weeks. He had taken to wandering the castle under the guise of his invisibility cloak in the daytime hours. He still preferred to move around unimpeded by the cloak at night, so long as curfew had not yet fallen, but doing so in the middle of the day had become genuinely dangerous. A number of unpleasant spells had found their mark in the past two days alone and the twins had tried to ambush him four times in the last week. Every time they failed, they seemed to grow more and more spiteful as their plans became more and more malicious.

It was immensely frustrating. Professor McGonagall had been one of the teachers whom Harry had liked a great deal, for one thing. For another, he had only shaken off the upper-year Slytherins a month earlier as a result of revealing himself as a Parselmouth. He had been enjoying that respite and was more than a little bit bitter to see it come to such a sudden end.

It had been a long two weeks, but this morning was different. Harry knew that before he understood why, but it was not difficult to put it together.

A hush hung over the Slytherin table. It was unlike anything Harry had ever experienced whilst at Hogwarts. All the other students seemed to be looking at them. Harry thought for a moment it was just the usual hateful stares, but there was more than that. He realized that the second he felt someone's eyes burning a hole straight through him.

It was Greengrass. She had looked at him often since her return from the holidays, but this... Merlin. Harry had never seen anyone watch him so hatefully. When he looked back at her, that was when he realized.

Tracey Davis was not the only one missing from her usual gaggle of friends. Bulstrode, Moon, and even Pansy were with her, but the tall, dark skinned boy who usually hung just behind her like a creeping shadow was noticeably absent.

That was when it clicked.

Blaise Zabini had been petrified. The son of the infamous black widow had been struck down on Valentine's Day and it sent a very clear message.

Not even the pureblooded Slytherins were safe from whomever it was behind these escalating attacks.

***February 27, 1993***

***The Dungeons***

***9:56 PM***

Harry sidestepped a purple spell from Cassie and dove to the side. There was no use throwing up a Shield Charm against the kind of magic she was using. It would eat straight through whatever magical protection he was capable of conjuring.

She was so fast --- the spells seemed to come without pause, hurtling towards him one after the other. He was going to buckle under their onslaught soon, but there was one thing he could at least try.

He dodged a dark blue spell, leant out of the way of a sickening crimson one, and then saw the Stunner flying towards him. Harry's arm felt like lead, but he forced it to raise nevertheless. His shoulder screamed with the effort of it; this had been one of the longest duels he and Cassie had ever engaged in.

He lashed out with his wand as the spell drew near. His wand's tip met the jet of light in mid air and sent it spinning back towards its target. Cassie just barely managed to bat the spell back towards Harry, who this time sidestepped and cast a string of spells as fast as he could. It put Cassie on the back foot and he advanced, but his onslaught did not last long before it and he had been cut down.

"You're better than I thought you were," Cassie commended. "I saw you deflect my brother's curse in the common room, but I don't think you've used that against me until now."

"I haven't. I wasn't confident when I did it against Cadmus. It just sort of happened."

"It's impressive," said Cassie. "Plenty of novice duellists can't deflect spells. That alone will help you beat a lot of witches and wizards."

"It's not enough to beat someone like you, though."

She smiled thinly. "No, it's not, but you really are getting better. I might have to find someone a bit less experienced to come practice with you sometime. I'd be curious to see how you did against an older student who isn't me."

"Your casting speed got me," Harry admitted. "I know you'd have beat me no matter what, but I don't understand how you cast so fast."

Cassie eyed him critically. "Well," she said after a moment's pause, "since you seem to have gotten the hang of spell deflection, I suppose I can show you."

Harry's eyes widened. "Really?"

The older girl raised an eyebrow. "Are you here to learn, or not? Yes, of course I can show you," she said with a smile. "That's the entire reason we're here."

That was something Harry had always liked about Cassie. She was easy going despite her prowess with a wand. She was deceptive that way. A bubbly personality who could cut you to pieces if you ever gave her just cause. And she really enjoyed duelling. She wasn't just good at it, she enjoyed it. She enjoyed talking about it and she enjoyed teaching it. Harry found it infectious.

His trust in people had waned this year and Cassie was no exception. The more skeptical he became of the Malfoys, the more he pondered Cassie's motives, but he liked her. Whatever her aims were, he knew that and hoped immensely it was a friendship he could retain. So long as she did not betray him like so many others, he really could not have had a better teacher.

"Get out your wand again, we still have some time. When I cast rapidly, I'm using a technique called chain casting..."

***Meanwhile, in an abandoned classroom...***

"What if we slipped him a poisoned sweet?"

"Don't be thick, they'd expel us if we killed the git."

"Oi! I never said anything about killing him!"

"But you want to play around with poisons?"

"Do you have any better ideas?"

"Clearly not, brother dear. If I did, we might not still be in this room."

"Novel idea, that. I'm getting sick of seeing the inside of this room. Why can't we just roll up on the git and curse him into oblivion?"

"Do you really need me to answer that?"

"No, but it would be fun."

"It would, but not worth it."

"I hate when you're right."

"Only when I'm right about something you don't want to hear."

"Well yes, Forge, that's how narratives work."

Both twins chuckled as they brushed red locks of hair from their eyes in unison. They had been bent over stacks of paper for the best part of six hours now and their necks had long since begun to ache.

"Seriously though," said George, "we really need to solve this before one of us goes mad."

"One of us? We both know if one of us goes off the deep end, the both of us will drown."

"Touché." George opened his mouth to say more, but he was interrupted by a loud tapping sound that came from the room's window. "What the..."

Both boys turned their heads and saw that there was an elegant-looking eagle owl flapping its wings outside. A roll of parchment looked to be tied to its leg.

The twins exchanged looks as they made their way towards the window. "We really need to work out how owls find us in places like this," Fred said as he opened the window and allowed it inside.

"I never have quite got that," George agreed as he untied the parchment from the owl's leg and removed its burden. "Like, how the hell does this thing get off finding us here?"

The owl squawked loudly once the letter had been removed from its leg and shot back out the open window and into the brisk winter air before either twin could so much as move.

Both of them had moved on by now and were leaning over the letter. As their eyes moved down the parchment, they grew wider and wider.

"Blimey," said George. "This is it, isn't it?"

Fred grinned sharply as a devilish gleam came alive in his eyes. "I think it is, brother dear."

***March 8, 1993***

***The Knight's Room***

***8:43 PM***

The sound of Hermione's wand clattering to the floor seemed to echo through the hidden room as though someone had shattered glass in an otherwise empty void filled only by darkness and silence. Everyone seemed to stop what they were doing and turn their attention to her and Ron, whose jaw hung open.

He was as surprised as anyone to have disarmed her. Nobody but Cedric had managed to get the best of Hermione in a duel. It was actually a strange feeling to watch her scramble for her wand. Her cheeks were tinged pink and she did not meet Ron's stare, but he didn't care.

The sound of her wand against the floor had sent a rush through his body. It was as good as any Quidditch victory he had ever known. Catching the snitch was one thing, but this was different altogether.

He had been on a warpath to improve ever since their ill-fated attempt to recover the Philosopher's Stone ended so miserably last June. Nothing could compare to the crushing pain Ron had felt whilst standing atop the hill and peering down at Neville's grave through eyes that stung with the salt of tears.

His efforts had only been redoubled after he had been tortured and enchanted to forget the whole thing had ever happened. Crushing dread had filled him then at the daunting challenge the school faced, but it had eventually solidified into a drive that had never been paralleled.

To see all of that manifest in one moment as the brilliant muggleborn's wand was torn away from her... it was powerful. Something seemed to awaken and roar within Ron's chest as a warm, primal glee surged forth to fill him like a scalding drink on a cold winter's night.

This was the beginning. This is what it would take to become the wizard he needed to become in order to honour Neville's memory and to make sure nothing else so horrible befell him or his friends. It was only the beginning, but it was a good one. Ron squared off against Hermione once more, ready to go again and continue his thrilling journey.

***March 20, 1993***

***The Dungeons***

***10:11 PM***

Harry's streak of good nights spent duelling with Cassie had ended tonight. One of the bastards in the hallway had caught him with something vile. It caused all the muscles in his calf to contract horribly. They had felt fit to burst and it had been very fortunate that a sixth-year Ravenclaw prefect had been there to reverse the spell's effects. Even after they had been reversed, Harry still limped on the leg heavily. It made duelling a right pain. It made duelling someone as talented as Cassandra Yaxley next to impossible. That night had consisted mostly of Harry getting battered around as Cassie put in minimal effort and did as she pleased. Not the greatest night for morale, but it had at least reaffirmed to Harry that he was resilient and was now beyond panicking when the exchanges were not going his way.

He was beyond sick of students cursing him in the halls. It had been nearly two months since McGonagall had been attacked. Harry had hoped briefly after Zabini had been petrified that perhaps there would be a reprieve and his hopes had been quickly dashed.

The general consensus among the Gryffindors seemed to be that Harry had attacked Zabini to cover his tracks. He had even heard a couple of Hufflepuffs go as far as to mention that Voldemort had been notoriously cruel to those who had served him. If one dark lord had acted in such a way, surely it was only natural that the next one followed in his footsteps?

Harry was sick of it all. Sometimes, it made him want to do things that Voldemort and Grindelwald would likely have been proud of.

Grindelwald... that was a name Harry had not pondered in some time and it was better that way.

He cleared his mind with Occlumency as he rounded the next bend on his way back to the common room...

And froze at the sight before him.

*No,* he thought, *this can't be happening.*

Large red letters spelled out a vivid message upon the wall, but there was no body sprawled across the floor. Was this what it looked like for the alleged Heir's victims before their monster struck? Had Harry walked in on the setup of an attack seconds before it took place.

But no, that was not right --- the lettering was different. It was crimson and resembled the colour of Gryffindor house more than it did human blood.

Oh, Merlin, that was not a good sign.

Harry put the pieces together just as he read the writing on the wall but by then, it was much too late.

*The little snake's bite might turn students to statues, but the snake should be careful that statues don't bite back.*

Then a sound tore through the corridor as something nearby exploded outwards. Harry could see rushing fire and felt many sharp objects pierce his skin as dreadful heat enveloped his body, but blackness claimed him before he could piece together exactly what had just happened.

***The Hospital Wing***

***3:44 AM***

Harry seemed to glide as he moved down the hall, his steps not making so much as a sound. It was late and the halls were void of bodies and noise. The torches still flickered in their brackets hung upon the walls, but they seemed dimmer somehow. Almost like the thicker than usual darkness of this place was swallowing as much of their blazing light as it could.

Harry rounded the next corridor and froze in mid stride. Red writing was splattered on the wall and the corridor smelled unmistakably of blood. Its coppery scent hung so thickly in the air that Harry almost gagged. It was hard to breathe through it. Its smell filled his nostrils as its taste inexplicably invaded his mouth and its thin, sticky texture seemed to run down his throat.

Then he noticed the bodies on the floor and looked down. Diana and Cassie stood out most. Their blonde hair was the brightest thing in the corridor despite the skin of each fallen victim having grown as pale as the full moon. Cassius was there, with his throat torn open and the same substance that splattered the wall having run down his body like a thick layer of sweat before soaking through his robes and staining them with its mark. Pansy and Theodore lay there, still and unmoving. If not for the unnatural pallor of their skin, they could have passed for two people in a deep and peaceful sleep.

After what felt like a stunned age alone in silence, a sound reached Harry's ears. It echoed loudly through the corridors of Hogwarts as it drew nearer. By the time Harry recognized it, its source was upon him.

Footsteps.

It was Draco. His skin too was as pale as the victims on the floor, but his eyes were different. Their normal grey had been replaced by an unearthly scarlet that gleamed in the dim light of the hall. It had invaded his iris as well as his pupil --- there was no telling where one ended and the other began.

"Draco? What... what's happening here?"

More bodies appeared around them. Harry recognized each and every one. The mangled guards from Nurmengard with their twisted necks, spines that pierced their skin like the handle of a child's lollipop sticking out from its wrapper; even the inverted head on the third, with his spine protruding up through his skin and stuck straight through his jaw like an embedded arrow shaft.

They were not the most gruesome sight. The boy from Grindelwald's final vision was there. He must have clawed his very skin away trying to suppress the pain wrought by what Grindelwald had done, for pale bits of bone showed all about his skull. The little skin that remained was peeling away like aged and weathered paint subjected to a harsh torrent of rain.

Yet the most horrific and tauntingly familiar body was the smallest of all.

Wylla Nurmen lay there in the corridor with her horribly punctured body and the shattered remains of her skull. The part of the corridor she laid upon was not made up of stone, but pale, shimmering snow that was beginning to darken as her blood stained it a dark and vivid red.

It was all too much.

Harry fell to his knees and screamed. He screamed like he had never screamed before as he pressed his fingers against his temples and wished for it to end. Let him take one of their places if it meant this misery would be over. Let it be finished for good.

"Harry! Harry, it's okay. You're okay."

The corridor was gone, but he was still screaming. Why was he screaming? Everything ached or stung like it never had before, but the pain was not so unbearable that he needed to scream loudly enough that he had surely woken half the castle. What had happened?

Then the dream began to come back to him and he shuddered violently as if bent against the strong and bitter winter wind outside of Grindelwald's boyhood home. The room he was in felt stiflingly warm, but a cold sort of sweat clung to him in spite of that fact. The pale sheets that cocooned him in warmth were twisted all about him like a child's swaddling clothes; he must have been thrashing around horribly in the midst of his nightmare.

Which begged the question --- where was he now?

Pale sheets, pale ceilings, pale walls, and a feminine voice that had woken him. It was certainly not the Slytherin common room, but he began to suspect something else.

"Hospital wing," he muttered. "Something about statues and explosions."

"Harry, are you okay? You woke up screaming."

He let his eyes follow the source of the voice and shivered more violently still. It was Diana. Her hair was every bit as bright as it had been in the dream, but her skin was flushed with the natural sheen of life and did not resemble a marble statue. Cassie was there, too. Both girls sat side by side. The first voice --- the one that had jolted him --- had been Cassie's, Harry realized.

"I'm... fine. Just... delayed reaction, I guess."

"Delayed is one word for it." There was a certain edge to Cassie's words that Harry had never heard there before. It made him frown as he glanced about the room.

"What time is it?"

"Almost 4:00 in the morning," answered Diana.

"So I've been out... what? Six hours?"

The two girls exchanged glances. "Harry, you've been out for a day and a half. We're surprised to see you awake so soon."

His eyes bulged. "A day and a half?"

Both girls nodded as Harry tried and failed to free himself from the sheets. Just them resting against his skin caused unimaginable pain. It was like somebody had scraped him with a razor the day after he'd received the world's most painful sunburn. He grit his teeth against it and let himself fall back against the soft mattress underneath him.

"Don't try and move too much," said Diana, standing to help gently untangle the sheets from Harry. It hurt like hell, but much less with her aid.

"What happened?" Harry asked once she had finished. "Why does..." his voice trailed off when he caught sight of his right arm. The skin was raw and tinged pink all over. He wanted to look away, but couldn't. There was a certain sick fascination about it.

"Somebody set up a trap for you," Cassie explained. "You walked into a trapped corridor on the way back from our last practice. There was a message on the wall kind of like what the person behind the petrifications seems to do. I'm guessing the suit of armour exploded when you were nearby because I heard something go off and rushed ahead but by the time I got there, it was in pieces and you... were in a bad state."

Harry winced. "How bad is 'bad', exactly?"

"There were shards of the armour embedded in your skin," Cassie went on with a grimace. "Your torso looked like a pin cushion."

"Lovely, is that why it hurts to move?"

"No," said Diana, "Madam Pomfrey fixed that pretty quickly. It's the burns that were the problem."

"The... burns?"

"You were caught in the explosion. Whoever rigged the suit of armour either wants you dead or underestimated the blast radius. You were on fire when I came into the corridor." Harry saw a slight tremor in Cassie's shoulders and her voice wavered, if only for a second. "It was all I could do to put you out and get you to the hospital wing as fast as I could."

Harry spared her a slight smile. Perhaps she would not betray him. If she wanted to, surely she would have let him die in that corridor, for it sounded like that was what would have happened had she not intervened.

"Thanks, Cassie," he said with a blush, looking away and swiftly clearing his mind of all memories of being forced to say those words for far less genuine things. "You probably saved my life in that corridor."

She spared him a thin and tired smile.

"You should sleep," said Diana. "I know you've been out for a while, but I don't think it was restful and you'll need your strength. You're not recovered yet."

Harry grimaced but did not argue as the two girls quietly filed out of the room, Diana removing the Silencing Charms she had placed around Harry's bed as they did.

What a mess. Now he not only had to deal with everything, but he ought to find out who had tried to kill him and why.

***Later that day...***

Harry wasn't sure what he had expected to feel after someone had done their best to murder him. Anger, perhaps? Overwhelming rage that would set him on a warpath? Fear, maybe? It would be logical to be wary of more attempts in the future.

He felt none of those things, which struck him as odd. Even more so because the only thing he felt was an overwhelming sensation of nothing.

It was like he was numb to it all. Perhaps he was lost to shock, or perhaps years of horrendous treatment at the hands of the Dursleys had prepared him for this. Maybe he was not as surprised as he ought to have been that someone had tried to murder him whilst at school.

Not that he didn't care. He most certainly did and his top priority at the moment was piecing together exactly who had been behind the attack.

It hadn't been the alleged Heir of Slytherin. Harry was relatively sure of that. This was too different from their style and Harry had not forgotten the way the writing on the wall had shimmered with the crimson light of the Gryffindor crest. The Heir of Slytherin was prideful. They took credit for their work and would not have hidden behind something that implicated anyone but them.

Yet if it was a Gryffindor, Harry was having trouble coming up with who could be behind it. The Weasley twins were the obvious candidates, but would they really try and kill him? Their antics had become more and more troubling in the subsequent weeks and months, but never had they tried anything like this. They were malicious bastards, sure, but murderous ones? They had never struck Harry as psychopaths, but he supposed he didn't know them.

His bets currently rested on one of the upper-year Slytherins --- and wasn't that a fun thought? The knowledge that someone who shared a common room with him each and every night may have tried to kill him was not one that put Harry's mind at ease. Yet it made sense. None had dared to oppose him after his Parseltongue ability had been revealed, but striking from the shadows made sense. It was probably what Harry would have done if he had been so inclined to attack himself in their spot.

It was all a complete and total mess.

Harry heard someone clear their throat from nearby and looked up. It was Madam Pomfrey and for a moment, Harry dreaded she would look over him again. She had already done that four times today and he was not so eager for the fifth.

"You have a visitor who would like to see you," she said instead. "I don't like it, but he's an important man who's come a long way, so I'll allow it if you'd like for me to let him in."

"Who is it?" Harry asked, thrown by her demeanour.

"Mr. Malfoy."

Lord Malfoy had come to Hogwarts? It was almost an inconceivable idea, but he remembered suddenly that the man was the Head of the Hogwarts Board of Governors.

Harry's heartbeat quickened.

*"The Malfoys might view you as a tool, but that doesn't mean all of us do."*

Could he trust Lord Malfoy? He was the one who Harry had the most doubts about. The man had seemed a saint to him once and had always treated Harry like royalty, but had Daphne been onto something before she had betrayed him? Was it all for his own game and only so Harry could be used as a pawn in the man's machinations?

"I'll see him," Harry decided. Whether he was being used or not, Lord Malfoy had always been generous. Perhaps he would be so again. Harry could take advantage of the man's generosity without buying blindly into everything he said.

That... was actually quite the revelation. Harry from the start of the year would never have had that thought, but now... it seemed so glaringly obvious. He didn't need to cut all ties with the Malfoy family or to be the best of friends with them. There was a middle ground that could be of great benefit without leading him too far astray.

Madam Pomfrey had disappeared, but Lord Malfoy was sweeping into the room now. His blond hair was immaculate as ever, as were his dark green robes.

"It's good to see you again," said Lord Malfoy, taking a seat next to Harry's bed. "I do wish we were meeting under more... favourable circumstances for you."

"Thank you, sir, and it's good to see you again, too."

"Can you explain to me what happened?"

The man sat attentively as Harry explained everything Cassie had relayed to him.

"I think it might be one of the upper-year Slytherins." This much, at least, he trusted with Draco's father. There was no reason the man wouldn't give him an honest read. If he wanted to use him, he needed Harry alive.

"You think one of your own housemates did this?"

"I don't see who else could have. They've been making my life hell for most of the year and I don't know any Gryffindor who would have done this."

Lord Malfoy's eyes darkened. "Do not underestimate the lions' propensity for maliciousness. Sirius Black was a Gryffindor and there were many atrocities on Dumbledore's side of the last war as well. I think you will find that Gryffindors are perfectly willing to put the morals that they are so very proud of aside if it's to further a cause they themselves believe in." He was smiling, but there was no warmth in his expression. Just an edge so sharp it could cut through steel. "Funny how that works out, isn't it?"

"So you think it really was a Gryffindor?"

Lord Malfoy shook his head. "I am much too removed from the castle and its dynamics. What I will say is that you should never dismiss a suspect because of virtues you believe them to hold. Your parents did that and it cost them dearly."

Harry felt his heart skip a beat. "My parents?" he asked. "What about them?"

"Oh, dear," Lucius muttered, twirling a lock of hair. "Another time," he decided, "you have quite enough on your plate right now. This summer, I will tell you the story. It is not a pleasant one."

Harry wanted to argue. He had to wait to know why Voldemort killed his parents, he had to wait until he would be able to force the connection between him and Voldemort closed, and now he had to wait to learn of what his parents had done. It was maddening and he was sick of waiting, but he held his tongue with great difficulty.

"I do have some good news for you pertaining to the summer holidays," said Lucius. Harry waited, watching the man with wide and curious eyes. "Do you remember the conversation we had about your poor treatment and unacceptable living arrangement?"

Harry swore his heart stopped beating for a full two seconds. He opened his mouth and tried to speak, but it was to no avail. Something seemed to be obstructing his airways, so he simply chose to nod.

"I have begun making headway on remedying that problem. My political influence was quite tied up forcing amendments to Weasleys' damnable Muggle Protection Act. Now that that's done, I will be focusing my full attention on shifting your guardianship off of those filthy creatures who you have been forced to live with."

Harry's heart went from not beating at all to pounding so hard he thought it might explode. It was quite the jarring shift, and suddenly the room seemed to spin all around him.

"It's... actually going to happen?" he asked quietly.

He almost leapt up from the bed when Lord Malfoy startled him with a hand on his shoulder. "There are many things that can be said about the Malfoy family, but we always keep our word."

***April 1, 1993***

***The Library***

***9:22 PM***

"I do wish you wouldn't leave me," Luna said in that sing-song way of hers. "Everyone seems to leave me. Ginny's hardly spoken to me at all this year."

"Ginny?" Diana asked carefully. "The youngest Weasley?"

"Mhm. I thought we were friends." A contemplative expression spread across the first-year's face. "We should be friends. I don't see her with anyone else; we have a lot in common."

Diana instinctively glanced around the library, but no one turned their heads towards them. There were privacy wards in place so that was only natural, but she feared those things.

The Lovegood family was an old one, but the name had lost any real prestige long ago. Any lustre it had once carried died the moment its current lord began spreading his nonsensical ramblings in that rag he called a newspaper. Some people would be quite displeased to see her associating with his daughter. Diana suspected it was only her status as the Malfoy heiress that had kept some of the blunter Slytherins off her back so far. That and her father's reputation; they probably thought Lucius Malfoy's daughter had to be using Luna Lovegood in some way or another.

They would be right, of course. Had her father not encouraged her, Diana doubted she would ever have spoken a word to the Ravenclaw outcast, but Lovegood had a funny way of almost making her feel guilty.

Almost.

"I'm sure you could be friends if you put in the effort."

Luna's face fell. "No," she said thoughtfully, "I don't think so."

Diana tilted her head. "Why not?"

"My housemates aren't very nice to me. I don't think Ginny would like them being the way they are." Diana tried to construct her next reply, but Luna's mind seemed to have moved on before she could. "Will you leave me?"

Diana frowned. "Pardon?"

"You're leaving me for the holidays---"

"Merlin, Luna. I'm not leaving you. My father wanted me to come home; that's all I'm doing."

Luna just hummed. "Will we be friends when you come back?"

What an odd situation Diana had found herself in. She had meant to cultivate a friendship when the two of them had spoken for the first time at the Duelling Club's last meeting, but Merlin, she had never known what she was in for by slowly talking more and more. Now they met at least once per week in the library, and those hours spent with Luna were some of the strangest and most jarring Diana had ever lived through.

"Why wouldn't we be friends when I came back?" Luna opened her mouth, but Diana cut her off. "You know what? No, it doesn't matter. Don't think like that, Luna. Of course we'll be friends. No one event is going to change that any time soon."

Luna smiled knowingly back at her. "If you say so."

***April 2, 1993***

***The Entrance Hall***

***10:37 AM***

The Easter holidays had arrived and never had Harry seen so many people leaving the castle for the occasion. Not that he could blame them. He would have joined them if he could, but for now, the Dursleys still presided as his official legal guardians. And wasn't that just the most pathetic thing in the world? He could take them all apart in minutes if he so chose. Grindelwald had been right about one thing. Wizards allowed the muggles to lord over them in many ways, and it made no sense. It infuriated Harry and the talk with Draco's father had brought all those emotions to the surface once more.

There had been no new attacks since Blaise Zabini had been petrified, but Harry suspected a large portion of the departing students wished to flee from the alleged Heir of Slytherin and the chaos they had brought down upon the school. Everything had kicked up a notch the night Professor McGonagall had been petrified and it had not gone back down since.

The one positive thing to come out of it all was that Dumbledore had been teaching Transfiguration for more than two months now. McGonagall was an excellent teacher, but Dumbledore had a way about it and pushed Harry in ways McGonagall never had. When he saw that Harry could complete a task without issue, he would give him something different and more challenging to do. Harry could also ask him questions about the subject both in class and in his office each Friday evening. That was something he had begun doing more often; asking Dumbledore about Transfiguration and about magic in general. The Headmaster had been a great help and Harry's rapid progression in Transfiguration had been nothing short of astonishing.

Diana and Cassie were leaving for home once again, as were Pansy and Theodore. The only friend Harry would have left at the castle was Cassius, but he didn't mind. The air outside had begun to grow less frigid with the coming of spring and the snow had thinned so much that by now, it was almost gone. Harry and Cassius intended to spend more time flying this break than they had in months, discounting Quidditch, and Harry was greatly looking forward to it.

One person he did not see leaving the castle was Draco. He wished his friends a happy Easter and then turned on his heel. Harry had not watched him go, but he suspected Draco had returned to his dormitory to brood. Harry still didn't understand why Diana had returned home each break whilst Draco remained at Hogwarts. It was very unlike what he had seen from Lucius Malfoy to treat either of his children like anything short of royalty.

Harry and Cassius began moving away from the castle's main doors once their friends had left. "Look on the bright side, a lot of the dickheads in red who have been giving you a hard time are gone for a week."

Harry's expression was somewhere between a smirk and a grimace. "There's that, at least. Honestly, if I could just get---"

"Harry, watch out!"

Harry dove to the side on instinct alone and he heard Cassius follow. Something rained down from above and splattered against the hard stone floor where Harry had been standing a moment earlier.

He rolled to the side and leapt to his feet, wand in hand. The floor was covered in a horrible green substance with a consistency like sick. It hissed and seemed to writhe on the floor. No one was around, but this strike was clear. None in the castle other than the Weasley twins would rig something like this. What that green something would have done had it covered Harry, he did not wish to know.

He glanced towards where the voice had come from and came up short. Draco was standing in an alcove, staring at Harry with an odd look in his eyes that the raven-haired youth could not place. Draco must have been watching them from the shadows. It was an odd thought, but not nearly as odd as his former friend saving him from impending disaster.

The two of them stared at each other for a long and awkward moment while Cassius continued to scan the corridor for any sign of the twins.

"Uh... thanks," Harry said after a minute, not quite knowing what to say.

Draco nodded. "We're even. You spared me from a disaster on Yule. I didn't forget." He waited for Harry to say something, but the boy himself kept quiet. Harry thought he saw a sad look appear in Draco's eyes after a minute, but it was hard to say. "Have a happy Easter, Harry," the blonde said before turning on his heel and striding away from them down the corridor.

Harry watched him go with warring emotions and a blank expression.

***April 11, 1993***

***Malfoy Manor***

***12:00 AM***

Harry had grown stronger in the months since he had regained some semblance of a body. He still sat upon his hostess's lap, but he no longer fell back into her and hadn't the need for constant support any longer. He was now able to lean forward and survey the few followers that remained to him here with the woman maintaining only a soft hold on him to ensure he did not fall.

They sat at the head of the table, the four chairs nearest them occupied by men in dark robes. There were two of them on each side of the table sitting across from one another. On his left sat Lucius with his blond hair gleaming in the light of the lantern that sat just in front of him. Beside him sat Tiberius, who was aimlessly twirling his wand whilst he waited for the meeting to begin. The man's eyes never left him even as he did so. Tiberius was one of the only ones who looked at him now. Him and the man across from Lucius were the only two not so repulsed that they looked away. Harry could not blame them. He had become a disgusting excuse of a creature. That would cease being true in due time.

Across from Lucius sat Regulus. His gaze was on him as always and it was unblinking. Harry thought Regulus may well be his most valuable follower as of now. He was nearly as loyal as Bellatrix, commanded the influence held by his family, and was one of the foremost experts on archaic magic alive. His knowledge could not compare to Harry's or that of the old fool, but there were only two others he knew of with knowledge to rival him. One was in Azkaban; a man Harry had known for many years. The other had turned traitor more than eleven years ago. His time would come.

Perhaps it would come at the hands of the fourth man if Harry himself did not choose to do the deed. Corban Yaxley had always been an outstanding duellist. Whether or not he could beat the traitor in open combat remained to be seen, but if any of his followers could, it would be him, Bellatrix, or Dolohov. The latter two still sat imprisoned on that hovel of an island, but they would be free in time. Their patience would be rewarded, but not now. He was much too weak to even stand.

"An update, Lucius?" Harry asked in that high, cold voice. It was clearer than the last time he'd heard it and less filled with cracks.

"I am making progress, My Lord. It is difficult to hint at these things without being too heavy handed."

"Err on the side of caution. They will know when I have returned. I simply wish to ensure they make the wisest choice when that beautiful day comes."

"Yes, My Lord."

"And what of your other plan, Lucius?"

"It will not be as easy as I had hoped," Malfoy said with a bitter scowl. "Dumbledore will fight tooth and nail to keep the boy away from me. The man distrusts me and I have no connection to him. Narcissa, yes, but not I."

"I may have a solution if I may, My Lord?" Regulus seldom spoke at these gatherings, but people listened when he did.

"Go on."

"My brother was the boy's godfather and my aunt was his grandmother. Dumbledore will have a harder time dismissing my claim."

Harry could practically feel his own eyes gleam. "Very good. See it done and ensure it happens before the solstice arrives."

"Yes, My Lord."

There was excitement now, excitement unlike anything he had felt in years. Soon, his power would return alongside all the sniveling cowards who called themselves loyal. But Harry would not need to rely on them for long. Not when his true loyalists were free and not when new blood had been captivated.

Everything was going to plan --- now, he just had to ensure that it stayed that way. Now, he just had to hope that all inside the castle went to plan when the time came.

***The Headmaster's Office***

***9:48 PM***

Harry's Occlumency had grown in leaps and bounds over the course of the school year. He was now able to repel Dumbledore's lighter Legilimency probes without much effort. Getting started with Occlumency had been extremely difficult. Learning to clear his mind was one of the hardest things he had ever done. The first meditative stage had seemed to last forever and for a time, Harry had feared he may have strayed from the path and that he might never see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Once he had finally gotten past that stage, everything had become much easier. Defending his mind felt almost effortless compared to how finding it had been. Controlling it was still difficult. Grindelwald had mentioned many months ago how one could master and control their own emotions. That still felt so far out of reach to Harry that he might as well have been trying to jump high enough to touch the moon.

Yet he had made vast improvements in actively defending his mind this year. Dumbledore was beginning to vary his psychic attacks now and had long begun to increase the pressure that he applied. The more difficult the attacks became to repel, the faster Harry felt as though he was improving. It was like he had been thrown in water at first and nearly drowned but once he had overcome that obstacle, he took to moving about the seas with the ease of a fish.

"That will do for tonight," said Dumbledore. Harry sat back in his chair and let out a deep breath as he raised his hands to his temples. Dumbledore had broken through on one of his last attacks. Every time he did so whilst Harry was defending, it sent stabs of sharp and persistent pain coursing through his skull.

"I am very pleased with your progress. You should be very proud of what you've already accomplished."

"Thank you, sir. Do you think I'll be able to keep actual attacks out soon? Ones that would be used by people who actually wanted to take something from me?"

"Oh, yes, I think you could keep out less skilled practitioners already." Dumbledore raised a hand. "Do not mistake me. If you allowed them to attack your mind for an extended period of time, they would break through, but I think you could hold long enough to break eye contact and sever their connection."

"When do you think I'll be able to hold out against full-on attacks?"

The old man pursed his lips. "Who can say? You have improved faster than I anticipated and your question is not a simple one. I think you will find yourself able to defend your mind from most sooner than you might expect. That does not extend to somebody like Lord Voldemort. That is another matter altogether. Most men will never be ready to stand against that assault."

"Do you think I will, sir?"

"I do. All you need is to hold out long enough to sever the connection. I think that is an achievable goal."

"And what about our connection, Professor? You said I would be able to block it with enough practice. How hard will that be? How much practice will that take?"

Dumbledore rubbed his eyes. "I'm afraid I cannot answer you in good faith. The connection you share with Voldemort is completely unique as far as I am aware. It is difficult to answer questions about it."

"But you're sure I'll be able to do it?"

"As sure as I can be, yes. It will take a combination of active and passive Occlumency, but I believe it can be done."

Harry frowned. "Active and passive Occlumency?"

"Yes. Active Occlumency is what we have been practicing here; it is the art of defending one's mind from psychic attacks."

"What about the other?"

"The other pertains to more subtle manipulations of one's own mind. Clearing it is the most basic form of passive Occlumency, but there are others as well."

So that was where Grindelwald's experiments fell. They had been some twisted form of passive Occlumency. Or, that had been Grindelwald's goal, anyway; to discover a method with which doing that was possible.

"What other kinds of things can you do with it, sir?"

"Many things, Harry, but I do believe that is a conversation for another time. It is growing late; we should both pack in for the night unless you have anything else you wish to discuss."

"I do, actually." Dumbledore folded his hands in his lap and peered expectantly towards his pupil. This was often the time in the lesson when Harry would ask the wizened old man about magic or ask him for advice on how to get better at facets of it, but tonight, Harry had darker things to discuss. "I dreamt of Voldemort again."

"Did you?" asked Dumbledore as he sighed, looking all of a sudden a great deal wearier than he had been a moment before. Harry nodded grimly. "Very well. What is it you saw?"

"Some kind of meeting. There were people at a table. Three or four of them, maybe, and then Voldemort."

"Do you remember who any of the people were?"

Harry thought he remembered one, but it was vague and hazy. He could remember Voldemort pondering about one of them. Harry only remembered the way his hair had gleamed in the lantern nearest him and he thought he remembered recognizing him well.

But could he tell Dumbledore this? It had been something he had contemplated deeply for the better part of a week. If not for that inner conflict, he'd have rushed off to meet with the Headmaster that very next day.

Whether he trusted the man fully or not, condemning him in the eyes of Dumbledore for something Harry wasn't positive he was connected with sat wrongly with him. It really was quite hazy and Harry was not at all sure he was remembering things right.

And even if he was, did he want to turn the man over to Dumbledore? The one man who was trying to get him out of the miserable situation life had thrown him into more than eleven years earlier? One of the only men who seemed to genuinely care about Harry, no matter what his intentions were. If he wanted to use him, he needed him in good shape. Did Harry want to throw such a valuable aid away because he might have sided with a man who Harry did not know? No matter what he had done, his words at the end of last year had given Harry some small margin of pause.

"I don't, no. It's... fuzzy. I don't know why I remember the first one so well. The others have been hazier."

"It could be due to any number of reasons," said Dumbledore. "Perhaps Voldemort's emotions were at their strongest during the first vision, or perhaps it happened whilst you were most awake. There are many things it could be."

Harry nodded, scratching his head and brushing a loose strand of raven hair from his eyes. "They were discussing something," he remembered. "Something about Voldemort's followers. How Voldemort thought they would come back to him or something."

"I fear that he assumes correctly. Many of his ilk would flock to him out of fear, if for no other reason."

"Right. Somebody else had suggested something, or asked him something. That's what made Voldemort mention it." Dumbledore nodded to show that he was still listening in silence. "There was... something about his other followers. He didn't say it, but he was thinking about them. The ones who weren't there but who were loyal."

"Many of his most violent followers are serving life sentences in the wizarding prison known as Azkaban. Bellatrix Lestrange was one of his Death Eaters and is famous for proclaiming her undying allegiance to Voldemort and his cause before being led off to the prison alongside her accomplices, but there are more. She is not the only notorious member of his inner circle to have willingly gone to Azkaban rather than lie their way out of a sentence."

Harry pondered Dumbledore's last sentence. Something nagged at the corners of his mind, but it eluded him. It jogged something in his memory but he could not decide what it was. That last bit had confused Harry, but it also made him feel like he was missing something.

"Right," he continued, shaking off the feeling. "There was more, too. He... assigned someone else a task, but I can't remember what it was. And Professor? There was something about Hogwarts. He never mentioned it, but he thought about it. I don't know what it is, but something is planned here at Hogwarts."

"It does not surprise me."

Harry's next words died on his tongue as he gaped at the old man before him. "It... doesn't?"

Dumbledore seemed to age a decade before his very eyes and for the first time since Harry had known him, Dumbledore looked as frail as one his age ought to have appeared.

"No, Harry, it does not. I have suspected that Voldemort has his hand in whatever is going on at the castle this year for some time now. I am simply out of ideas as to how he could be manipulating things from afar, and have no way to prove my suspicions in any case."

"You... think he's involved with the Chamber of Secrets? If you think there actually is a Chamber of Secrets," Harry added hastily; Dumbledore did not know he had overheard him that night in the hospital wing. He ought not to, at least. Sometimes, it felt like the man was omniscient.

"Oh, I am sure of both," Dumbledore said with a twisted smile. Harry thought it almost looked bitter.

"How can you be, sir? If you don't mind me asking."

"No, I suppose not," Dumbledore said with another sigh. "I ought to have told you some time ago, but I had hoped I would be able to resolve this madness one way or another before it concerned you."

"Concerned me? Why would it concern me?"

"Because it concerns Lord Voldemort very deeply and as we have covered, the two of you are linked in inexplicable ways."

"I thought you said that you only thought Voldemort was involved?"

"This is not the first time the Chamber of Secrets has been opened. I am afraid to say that it is not even the first time it has been opened whilst I've dwelled inside this castle."

"Professor," Harry asked with narrowed eyes and mounting suspicion, "what does this have to do with Voldemort?"

"It has everything to do with him," said Dumbledore. "Lord Voldemort was once a boy just like any other. A very troubled boy named Tom Riddle who was twisted by the hardships of his upbringing, but a boy nevertheless. He attended Hogwarts much like any other talented student his age would and was sorted into Slytherin, much like yourself."

Harry felt a shiver run up his spine as his skin seemed to crawl and his hairs stood on end.

That... reminded him far too much of himself. It scared him. The voice he had heard all the way back in September, the way Grindelwald's visions had changed him, and now this? He was already not the person he had been when he'd arrived at Hogwarts this past September, let alone before his first year. Was he walking the same path as Voldemort?

No, he couldn't be. Not if Dumbledore was going where Harry thought he was going. He wouldn't... he would never.

"You think he was the one to open the Chamber of Secrets the first time, don't you?"

"I am certain of it. Voldemort has boasted for many years of being Salazar Slytherin's final heir."

"And you believe him?"

"Oh, I more than believe him. I know his claim is true; I have researched it extensively and I do not believe any who were not blessed with Salazar's gift could find the chamber."

"You mean Parseltongue?"

Dumbledore looked at him then and there was an intensity about his stare. "Yes, Harry, I mean Parseltongue."

"Sir, that means if we found the Chamber, I could---"

"No. I would never have you risk yourself in such a way."

Harry scowled but knew by Dumbledore's tone that arguing would be fruitless. He was so sick of waiting. Why could Dumbledore not appreciate that he was not a child? He had seen things no child should ever see and had lived in what had felt like three lifetimes on Privet Drive. If Dumbledore only had confidence in Harry, they could end the threat now. Harry would not have been thrilled to involve himself in this mess, but if Voldemort really was involved... Voldemort, who would doubtlessly want Harry dead after the conclusion of their last confrontation...

"How do you know that it was Voldemort who opened the chamber? Is that the only reason you think it was?"

"Oh, no, there is much more. He did a rather poor job of framing Hagrid, for one thing."

"Hagrid‽" Harry asked incredulously. "He framed Hagrid‽"

"It was the very reason young Rubeus was expelled. He would have found himself an exile had I not intervened and secured him the position of Gamekeeper."

"How... how did anyone think it was Hagrid?"

"A good question, and one I myself have asked for many years. Armando Dippet was the Headmaster of the time --- he is the one sleeping in that portrait there, right behind my desk. He was very old and a wonderful man, but I believe his mind had begun to slip by the time Tom arrived at school."

Harry wasn't surprised. Dippet looked ancient in his frame. Thin, frail, and balding, with only scarce wisps of thin white hair left atop his head. The man looked fit to keel over at any second.

"Armando was very fond of Tom. All of the professors were. He was very charming and had a way with words. I'm sure it didn't hurt that he was probably the most brilliant student to ever pass through this school."

"So, he... what? Just talked his way out of it and blamed Hagrid?"

Dumbledore's expression darkened. "Hagrid himself had been raising a very dangerous magical creature in the school that same year. Tom discovered it and blamed it for the attacks that had been said to have been carried out by Slytherin's monster."

"And it... it couldn't have just gotten away from Hagrid and been behind them, could it?"

"It could have, very easily, but I know it never did. It is something I myself questioned, though I was sure Tom was guilty. I was a mere Transfiguration professor at the time and failed to convince Armando of my beliefs. It was one of my many failures regarding Tom Riddle."

"Your... failures?"

"A conversation for a different time. One that will come when you are older and wiser."

There it was again. That irrational twinge of anger and annoyance at having things loom ahead of him but feel so unreachable at the same time.

"So, you think Voldemort is somehow behind it again?"

"Oh, yes, I am quite sure of it. I always thought he might try again once he had left Hogwarts and I think he is the only one capable of such a thing. Slytherin has no other living descendants that we know of and it is only those descended from him who can speak his sacred tongue."

"Is that it? Is that why you think it concerns me?"

"No. I think your ability to speak with snakes has nothing to do with this mess."

"Then why, sir?"

Dumbledore watched him very closely. "Because I think Lord Voldemort is interested in you above all other things. Any plans he carries out at Hogwarts have you in mind."

"But... nothing about the chamber has had anything to do with me."

"Has it not? The last two students to have been attacked were Slytherins from your year, both linked to Miss Greengrass. She suspects you are the Heir of Slytherin entirely because of that first attack and the last will only make her more intent on proving herself right."

"They... what?" Harry had wondered whether Daphne thought him the Heir of Slytherin. This really just confirmed it, but it was the matter of fact manner with which Dumbledore said all of this. And that last part... "What about wanting to prove it?" Then, it clicked. That colourless, odourless liquid... it really had been Veritaserum.

Oh, Merlin, this was a mess...

"Miss Greengrass was very upset with you. She told me some interesting suspicions not long before the winter break. She was logical. Brilliant girl, Miss Greengrass. She may be the most naturally gifted intellectual to have passed through this castle since Voldemort himself. She was very adamant that I act against you. I, of course, suspected the truth even then and did nothing.

"But none of that is important. What is important is that Voldemort will have picked up on this in one manner or another and is trying to use a dangerous foe against you. He is already moving pieces into play that will make your life difficult and soon, more may fall into place."

***The Library***

***8:36 PM***

Ron was finding it more and more difficult to not nod off by the second. He and Hermione had spent hours that day in the library, just like they had for many days in the past number of months.

They had not dropped their quest to expose the Heir of Slytherin after their miserable attempt on Yule. Their efforts had only been redoubled once Ron had been attacked and Professor McGonagall had turned up petrified. Yet despite months and months of trying, they had not been all that successful.

There really just wasn't much to work with. Headmasters and Headmistresses had allegedly scoured the castle for generations in search of this fabled Chamber of Secrets and every single one of them had come up empty.

The only useful bit of information they had was that the Chamber of Secrets had been opened fifty years ago. That was helpful, but finding records of that time was... difficult. The library had an entire section dedicated to school records. There were many copies from each year, but most of them from fifty years ago seemed to have been edited. Hermione was insistent that one must have slipped through the cracks with how many copies there were, but Ron had grown well beyond skeptical many weeks ago now.

He had stopped staring at the mountain of papers before him some time ago and instead allowed himself to be drawn in by the rhythmic flickering of the candle that sat upon their desk and illuminated the scrolls of text spread across it. Dark spots had begun creeping all around the fire so that it almost gave the impression that the flame was sputtering, even though Ron knew he was simply becoming drowsy.

It took a titanic effort, but he pulled his attention away from the bright light and glanced around the room. The library was scarcely populated at this time. There were a few older students with their heads bent over hulking textbooks and heaps of parchment almost as large as Ron and Hermione's, but these students were sparse. The only other pairs of students Ron could see were the two pale first-year twins from Slytherin who seemed eerily united at all hours of the day, and the odd couple pairing of the older Malfoy girl and Luna Lovegood; a very strange girl who lived near the Burrow and who Ginny had shared an on and off friendship with for the better part of the last few years. That was the oddest pairing Ron could imagine, but he had seen the two of them here more and more often as the months dragged on. What Diana Malfoy could possibly be doing entertaining Luna Lovegood of all people, Ron could only guess.

"Ron," whispered Hermione, pulling him from his thoughts, "come look at this."

She had found more records from that year and Ron immediately noticed a difference. These ones looked more well-preserved somehow and there were several small bits of text he didn't remember seeing anywhere else.

Hermione indicated three sections with her finger. They all seemed to have taken place in quick succession, so Ron leant forward to look and his eyes widened at the first entry.

"Myrtle," he whispered, "she was the student who died?"

"Well, it doesn't say that it was because of the Heir of Slytherin, but look at these next two."

Ron did and he could immediately see what Hermione meant. It had been an eventful day at Hogwarts. Tom Riddle had been given the award Ron had scrubbed to perfection earlier that year on the same day and Hagrid...

"Blimey," Ron muttered, "this was when Hagrid got expelled?"

"They're connected," said Hermione, "they have to be. But that means---"

"Come off it," said Ron, "there's no way they thought Hagrid was the Heir of Slytherin."

"He's the only student I can find who got expelled that year and these are the only set of records that even show Myrtle's death. What else do you think is the answer?"

Ron hadn't the foggiest of ideas, but it made no sense. Surely no one had been foolish enough to think Hagrid had been behind the death of a student? It was complete and utter madness.

"He can't have done it," Ron said numbly.

"I know," said Hermione, whose voice shook as she whispered, "but you know who did then?"

"Uh... no?"

"Tom Riddle got an award for special services to the school the same day this happened. I'll bet he framed Hagrid. He was an upper-year Slytherin when this all happened; it makes sense."

Oh, Merlin... it did. It all made far too much sense. "But... what does this mean for this time?"

Hermione's face was twisted into a steely look of determination that was only made all the grimmer by the dim room and flickering candle. "I don't know, but we have to find out."

***THE LIFE AND LIES OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE***

***COMING THIS SUMMER!***

***By Rita Skeeter***

"What the..." Harry muttered as he took the paper and turned it over.

Diana shared a smirk with Cassie. "Sounds like an interesting read to me," she said, gesturing for Harry to place the paper in a spot where they could all read the article. Cassius leant forward along with them, beady eyes suspicious, but searching.

*I told you all a number of months ago that I would be running some investigative work on the Chamber of Secrets and the attacks that are plaguing Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.*

*Well, dear readers, I did what any sensible detective would do when investigating strange happenings at Hogwarts...*

*Start with the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor!*

*My digging is far from done and I have yet to find anything that implicates Albus Dumbledore's younger brother in anything regarding the Chamber of Secrets, but I have found much else. Things that implicate both him and his brother in things just as dark... if not darker.*

*To anyone who thinks Albus is a paragon of the light and that his family can do no wrong, I fear you are in for a rude awakening this summer when I present to you, 'The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore'.*

*Fear not, my investigations into the Chamber of Secrets are still ongoing and I will be sharing some insights from the book before the summer arrives. Insights that might make you all think I was onto something when starting with the less-famous Dumbledore brother.*

"I'll buy it," Cassius said with a smirk. "It'll be interesting to see someone go at Dumbledore. Nobody's really ever had any real success with that.

"If anyone can do it," said Diana, "it's Skeeter. The woman's mind is almost as sharp as her quill."

"It sounds like she's writing a biography," said Cassie. "I don't know how she thinks she's going to get enough information for that."

"It's Skeeter," Harry dismissed, "she'll just make it up."

"I don't think so," said Diana. "That would be risky. Dumbledore's supporters would hang her out to dry if she didn't come with factual information to support wild stories.

"She'll need at least a source," Cassie agreed.

Harry just sat back and nodded. It was an interesting development that would likely get lost in a storm of interesting developments, but perhaps it would add a layer of intrigue to the fast-approaching summer.

***May 1, 1993***

***The Knight's Room***

***10:29 PM***

Cedric, Susan, and Hannah listened on in enraptured disbelief as Ron and Hermione told them what they had found the night they next met. It was a mark of how serious all of this was that no one had yet discussed the fast-approaching Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff despite how high the stakes were following the badgers' loss to Slytherin earlier that year.

"Who is this Riddle person?" asked Susan. "I've never even heard of them."

"He was brilliant," said Hermione. "He took thirteen OWLs and scored outstanding on all of them --- same goes for his NEWTs. Some of his work on runes, archaic magic, and counter curses even got published before he ever graduated Hogwarts."

"Riddle's not a name I recognize," said Cedric. "You would expect the Heir of Slytherin to come from an old and prestigious family."

"Would you?" asked Hermione. "If they came from one of those, don't you think everyone would know they were the Heir? What if Slytherin or one of his descendants just wound up marrying a muggle or a muggle born or something?"

Cedric frowned deeply. "I suppose it's not impossible, but you would expect any connection at that point to be so distant that it might well be dormant. It's hard to say, though."

"It adds up though," said Susan. "It would explain why we've never heard of him as the Heir of Slytherin and the timeline works well. My auntie says that there are rarely coincidences in law."

Ron was fidgeting restlessly. "That's great and all, but what do we do? Do we tell someone about Hagrid being expelled for something he didn't do? Do we tell them about Riddle?"

Cedric, Susan, and Hannah exchanged looks. "It's... going to be really difficult to get anyone to reverse a decision made fifty years ago," said Hannah.

"Probably impossible," Susan agreed.

"But someone should know, right? That's still on Hagrid's criminal record."

"Someone should probably know, but do you think they'll really believe you?"

"Not without more proof," said Cedric. "If you could find something more. Whether that's who's doing it this time or something to prove that Myrtle was really the one who died and that those three pieces all go together. Then... maybe."

"I will!" Hermione promised with a huff, crossing her arms and looking ready to storm back off to the library at that very moment.

***May 7, 1993***

***The Library***

***8:56 PM***

"Diana?"

It was a Friday night and exams were approaching. Diana knew that in the next half an hour, the room would be much emptier but for now, it was rather busy. Most of the students were her age or older --- some of them visibly stressed while preparing for their OWL or NEWT exams.

Not that there were no younger students in the room. Weasley and Granger had been in here for some time, as was usually the case, and the Carrow twins had just entered and taken a seat near the Gryffindor duo. Diana watched them as they set down their bags. Hestia flicked her wand, either to get some spec of dirt off of it or to cast something, but Diana saw nothing happen. They must have been here to read up on whatever spell was giving them trouble. The two of them did *everything* together.

That was just not something the younger girl understood. The need for subtlety seemed completely lost on her and tact was clearly a foreign concept altogether. Diana did not dislike her, per se, she just found her... off-putting. She was kind, sweet, and strangely adorable, she was just never the type of person Diana would have associated with if her father had not so bluntly prompted it.

"Yes, Luna?"

"Would you like to come and visit me this summer? I wrote to Daddy asking if you could and he's excited to meet you."

That was it? This was all it was going to take to earn a meeting with Xenophilius Lovegood? Just a few months of spending time with his daughter and treating her like any decent human being ought to have done? It was almost depressing.

"If my father will allow me to," answered Diana, knowing all too well that the man would be more than happy to do just that. "He usually keeps me busy during the summers with social gatherings and the like."

"You can come whenever you'd like," said Luna. "Just pop in. I don't really have friends, so seeing you would be nice." It was one of those blunt things Luna said with complete nonchalance that would have made Diana feel uncomfortable if she was any less composed.

"We'll... schedule something," said Diana. "I'll try and find a time that works for you and your father as well as me and mine."

"Daddy won't mind. Just make sure it doesn't interfere with our travels in July."

"Oh? Where are you off to in July?"

"To find the crumple-horned snorkack. We almost found it last summer, but it got away. Daddy is sure that this will be the year. We just need to keep the wrackspurts away. He said they clouded our judgement and made us too impatient."

Diana just nodded numbly and turned back to her book. Sometimes, that was all anyone could do whilst dealing with Luna.

***May 8, 1993***

***The Quidditch Pitch***

***9:00 AM***

Harry enjoyed Quidditch immensely. Playing it was one of his absolute favourite things in the world and one of the few things that always made him feel light and gleeful. Even watching it had a certain majesty to it; a splendour that not many things could replicate with such ease.

The air seemed so thick with tension that it would take a Cutting Curse to slice through any of it at all. This was a must-win game for both teams. Gryffindor had defeated Ravenclaw after losing to Slytherin, whilst the badgers had fallen to the snakes several months ago before more recently beating Ravenclaw, who was well and truly out of the running. Either team could stay in contention for the Quidditch Cup with an impressive enough victory with only one match left to be played. Harry and the rest of the Slytherin team would face Ravenclaw at the end of the month. It was their easiest matchup on paper and the confidence both from the house and team were at an all-time high, though Marcus Flint had been doing his best to ensure none of his players became too overconfident.

Harry was hoping that Weasley would make a mistake and catch the snitch early on in the game. Beating Diggory to the golden ball would be no small feat --- he'd had a howler of a time doing it back in March --- but he knew that Diggory was too sharp to make that mistake. If Weasley became emotional the same way he had during the lions' match against Slytherin, then it was possible he would make the ill thought catch without considering the consequences.

The levels of noise exuding from the crowd rose and rose as the players took to centre field, but just as Madam Pomfrey rose the whistle to her lips, there came a loud, echoing bang that drew the attention of all onto the person who had summoned it.

It was Snape. He was striding towards centre pitch with his wand held aloft. Professor Sinistra walked alongside him. She had taken over as Head of Gryffindor House once Professor McGonagall had gone missing, but she did not look brave now. She was pale and shaky, a stark contrast to Snape, who was as stern and impassive as ever.

"ALL STUDENTS ARE TO RETURN TO THEIR COMMON ROOMS IMMEDIATELY," Snape's magically amplified voice declared, ringing through the stadium with great power and authority. "ANY WHO ARE CAUGHT DISOBEYING THIS ORDER WILL BE EXPELLED. THERE HAS BEEN ANOTHER ATTACK. THIS GAME HAS BEEN INDEFINITELY POSTPONED."

Harry heard gasps, moans, and even a few screams from the gathered crowd. A sharp intake of breath from his right was what caught his attention.

It had come from Draco, who was sitting between Crabbe and Goyle and looking wildly around the stadium. It did not take Harry long to ponder out why. Pansy was not with him, nor was she sitting with Daphne Greengrass and her ilk.

Which meant...

No... surely not, Pansy! Why Pansy?

*"Miss Greengrass was very upset with you. She told me some interesting suspicions not long before the winter break. She was logical. Brilliant girl, Miss Greengrass. She may be the most naturally gifted intellectual to have passed through this castle since Voldemort himself. She was very adamant that I act against you. I, of course, suspected the truth even then and did nothing.*

*"But none of that is important. What is important is that Voldemort will have picked up on this in one manner or another and is trying to use a dangerous foe against you. He is already moving pieces into play that will make your life difficult and soon, more may fall into place."*

Dumbledore had been right. Greengrass was glaring at him openly and he could see her fighting against outraged tears. Not even her Occlumency was helping her hold them back. Voldemort had moved yet another piece into play and done exactly what Dumbledore had feared, but it was worse than that.

If he really was watching Harry so closely, could he have noticed the way he and Pansy still shot each other friendly glances when Draco wasn't watching? Could he have even discovered that the two of them still met up to speak on occasion?

One way or the other, Voldemort --- or whoever had opened the Chamber of Secrets this time around --- had now made things personal and for some reason, Harry dreaded what would come next.

Yet even that was not all...

Why had Sinistra joined Snape out on the field? He was the Interim Deputy Headmaster. The last thing he needed was the backing of Professor McGonagall's stand... oh... Merlin!

She was the representative of Gryffindor House and was looking every bit as shaky as any of her students.

It had been a double attack.

***The Hospital Wing***

***9:26 AM***

There was no increase in Ron's heartbeat as he peered down at his best friend who lay face-up in a hospital bed. Her eyes were open and unnaturally wide. Ron could only guess that she had glimpsed whatever had attacked her seconds before it had stuck.

He did not feel anger or sadness yet, though he knew both would come. He just felt... numb. It was like when Neville had died last June all over again. Their adventurous escapades had led to yet another tragedy, even if this one was reversible. The Mandrakes were said to be almost ready, but that did little to ease Ron's mind.

It was seeing Hermione like this that mattered. It was seeing what had happened when they'd tried to be proactive. It was seeing, once again, a clear example that they were still only children. It stung, it burned, it cut so deeply that Ron could feel blood seep out of him even though not so much as a drop hit the floor.

What could he do now? Hermione had been researching Tom Riddle and the time period that the chamber had been opened right before she had been petrified. Did this confirm her theory? Had she been attacked as a means of silencing her? If that was true, was Ron next? Did the Heir of Slytherin know Hermione had been relaying all she had learned to him?

There were too many questions and not enough answers. Did he dare continue the chase? Without the cleverest witch he knew, did he stand any chance? Had he and Hermione together ever stood a chance?

Tremors began to grip his body and Ron could do little to fend them off. It was all his fault. It had been he who had been unwilling to give up after Yule. It had been he who had seen a fire lit underneath him when he had been attacked and tortured in January. It had been he who had pushed further and further despite having long-since realized that their hopes were bleak at best. He could remember all too well that crushing feeling of hopelessness he had felt the Saturday after he'd woken up unable to stand.

Yet he had pushed on, and Hermione had followed his example and even took charge. Had he not acted the way he had, perhaps she would not be in this position now: sprawled out across a hospital bed, unable to move and dead to the world.

It was maddening.

Ron lurched forward and clutched Hermione's hand in his. It was cold, but not so cold as to indicate death. There was still life inside of her, and that was what he had needed to feel. After Neville... no, he could not bear losing Hermione too.

Something did feel odd against his palm, though, and he stepped back and looked down. There was something clenched tightly in Hermione's fist. A roll of parchment, by the look of it. Frowning, Ron knelt down beside her and slowly began unravelling the roll of parchment from her grasp. It was no small feat. She must have been gripping it like a vice when she had been petrified, for her frozen fingers showed no interest in parting and allowing him access to what they held.

When it eventually came free, Ron could do little more than step back and peer down at the parchment as thin beads of sweat now trickled down his forehead. There was writing; Hermione's thin, neat script. What was written was not long, but it painted a clear picture to Ron. One so mesmerizing that it created a strong spell of dizziness that slammed into him like a wall of concussive force.

*Pipes... it must move through pipes. Myrtle died in the bathroom and swears the last thing she saw were big yellow eyes emerging from near one of the sinks. One of the exits for the monster is in her bathroom. It explains how it moves so stealthily and how no one has been able to pin it down.*

Ron stumbled so violently he had to clutch the edge of the bed to stay on his feet.

It was so obvious! Moaning Myrtle! That must have been where Hermione had gone. They had even told him she had been found separate from Parkinson, in a scarcely used corridor on the second floor. Hermione had realized how oblivious they had been to ignore Myrtle. She must have rushed off at the break of dawn to remedy their oversight. It explained why Ron had not seen her this morning and it explained why she had been so easily caught. If she had lurked so near one of the places the monster dwelled while learning about it and its history...

What was he to do with this? Dumbledore was the only one he could think of who might be capable of handling this, but how would one even find Dumbledore? Last year, McGonagall had dismissed their concerns as though they had meant nothing. Surely, Flitwick would do the same, and who else was he to go to? Snape, the new Deputy Headmaster? No, that would not do. Ron would sooner swallow one of the foul things that hung in glass jars down in the man's office.

He would need to give the note to Dumbledore during a meal. That was his only real course of action. The castle was locked down for today --- the only reason Ron was even here was because Professor Sinistra was waiting outside the hospital wing to escort him back to the common room.

Yes, he would need to wait until the lockdown was lifted and then he would need to pass the message along to Dumbledore. And it had to be to Dumbledore directly. This was much too important to be dismissed or overlooked. It was the only way.

It had not been difficult to sneak into the hospital wing. Not with the aid of his invisibility cloak. Harry had simply slipped it on and followed Ron and Professor Sinistra. The woman was as nervous as she had looked. Harry could hear her casting Homenum Revelio under her breath every so often, but he knew the spell would not work whilst his cloak protected him. It was exactly what Voldemort had tried and failed to locate him with last June.

It had been a mere matter of following Weasley into the hospital wing before the door shut and then standing off to the side and watching as he stood over Granger.

A part of Harry could not help but feel bad for Ron Weasley. Longbottom had been a close friend of his. Harry wondered whether Weasley would ever come to know how the boy had really died. He doubted it; that was perhaps the saddest thing of all. That and the image of him, shaking and broken atop that hill at Longbottom's funeral. A sight that had stained the corners of Harry's mind ever since.

Now, this. He could not claim to like Weasley. Not after he had tried to curse Pansy in September, and not after he had snuck into the Slytherin common room under the guise of Polyjuice Potion, but he didn't dislike him, either.

Weasley himself was doing something peculiar then. Prying something from Granger's still fist, or so it appeared. Harry watched on for a number of moments before the boy straightened up, peered down at the parchment, and staggered. Harry thought he would fall for a moment before he grasped the side of the bed. His breathing had grown louder and sliced through the room's thick and heavy silence with every heave of Weasley's chest serving as the next powerful stab.

Harry thought upon the Yule incident once again as he watched Weasley make hastily for the door, suddenly as pale as the bed sheets his muggleborn friend laid upon. That instance could even somewhat be chalked up to Weasley wanting the same thing that Harry himself now desired.

Merlin, did he ever want it badly...

He had stayed far away from everything pertaining to the Heir of Slytherin for the better part of a year. What business of his was it if a mysterious monster had been let loose at Hogwarts? What business of his was it if muggleborns he had never met were being attacked in the dead of night?

Harry thought now that he ought to have known it was more complicated than that once he had realized the Chamber of Secrets had been what Dobby had warned him of back at Malfoy Manor. He had not known until recently what the elf had meant, but he did now.

He even now knew what Dobby had meant by vague insinuations about it not being Voldemort. If Dumbledore's theory held true, the elf had technically not lied since it was not Voldemort himself opening the Chamber of Secrets. Harry could not see how on earth it could be.

Anything orchestrated by Voldemort would place Harry in a significant amount of danger by default. Voldemort's plan at Hogwarts meant nothing good for Harry. Especially not now. Not with first Blaise and now Pansy being attacked. The first was an implication to Greengrass, but this was more. It would do much the same as the former, but it was more personal. Pansy was a friend; one of the very few friends Harry had left. Seeing her lying motionless in a hospital bed off to the left of Granger's was sending waves of tumultuous anger coursing through Harry's body.

What was it with dark lords and using him as their chess piece? Could they not realize he was but a child and not worth their attention? And why did others have to suffer for it? He had as good as killed Longbottom in his haste to stop Voldemort, and now others were suffering just by virtue of knowing him? It was not fair! None of this was fair! Nothing this year had been fair and Harry was sick and tired of all of it!

Voldemort's preaching, the ideological uncertainty Harry still found himself gripped by, Neville's death, the portkey on the Hogwarts Express last June, his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys --- hell, the fact he'd had to go back to those filthy creatures in the first place --- Draco's betrayal, Grindelwald's visions and the way they had broken him so badly he had begun hearing voices, Aberforth's cruelty, Daphne's blame and betrayal, the fact Voldemort STILL seemed to be targeting him, and now this? How could one boy deal with so much and not break beyond repair?

Fury gripped him as he looked from Pansy to the spot Weasley had just occupied, and back again.

It would be so much easier if Voldemort did not insist on making Harry a pawn in his games. Had he not attacked Pansy, Harry would happily have continued standing back and watching. He had no stakes in any of this --- it was the Dark Lord who was forcing his hand. Harry hated it! How was he to live his life with the shadow of Voldemort looming over him? He would do anything to be rid of it and the shadowy threats it posed.

*"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\'t realize that love as powerful as your mother\'s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Voldemort, full of hatred, greed, and ambition could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good."*

Dumbledore's words from the conclusion of last year replayed on repeat in Harry's mind. A shiver ran up his spine at the memory of how agonizing it had been to touch Voldemort, but he had not been the one whose skin had melted and whose body had decayed.

He did not wish to face Voldemort again. He had no desire to fight him, but if his hand was forced...

For now, he didn't need to fight him. Dumbledore was still in the castle and if Weasley's dumbstruck expression had been any indication, he might have just found something that the Headmaster would be very interested in.

***That night, on the seventh floor...***

Harry had been waiting for so long that he feared the common room entrance may never open. The castle was on lockdown, but surely someone would sneak out or something would disrupt the peace and quiet.

He had fled the hospital wing quickly that morning after his plan had developed. Harry had known the Gryffindor common room was somewhere on the seventh floor. It had just been a matter of catching up to Weasley and Sinistra to figure out exactly where it was. Sneaking after them under the cloak had been easy and catching up had not been much more difficult. The secret passages of Hogwarts were familiar to him. Harry reckoned he knew more of them than anyone in the castle sans Filch, the Weasley twins, and perhaps a couple of older students here and there.

The problem was getting into the common room. Harry had heard the password uttered that morning and remembered it well enough. The issue was that if the entrance just opened and those inside saw no one enter, surely somebody would know that something was going on. Given the panic over the Heir of Slytherin and the full lockdown of the castle, they would all more than likely assume the worst and their inevitable cries would summon one of the professors.

That would not do.

It turned out to be one of the professors who inadvertently allowed him entrance into the common room. Sinistra returned almost an hour after Harry arrived outside the common room to perform a final check on her house before turning in for the evening. Harry waited until she had stepped inside before sliding in behind her, tuning her ramble out as he allowed his eyes to sweep over the new and unfamiliar room.

It was a strange rush to see it. One of the major rooms in the castle he had not yet seen, yet never pondered. Perhaps that ought to be a goal for next year; to see all of the common rooms and what they were like.

This one was warmer and cozier than the Slytherin one in the dungeons. It was circular and was dominated by a large fire. The chairs around the fire were smaller than theirs, but they were plusher and looked more comfortable. There were windows here where light would doubtlessly stream through them and illuminate the better part of the common room when the sun was up. It was a nice and homely place; Harry could see its appeal and realized with a jolt that his parents had likely spent many happy days lounging in this room.

It was a jarring thought, to be standing where his parents had dwelled for seven years --- it was the closest he had ever been to either of them. The first time he had truly thought of them since Voldemort's monologue at the end of last year and, before that, while peering into that damnable mirror.

Harry shook himself from those thoughts with great difficulty. The last time he had thought about his parents had been in a situation that ended in disaster. Doing so now was not conducive. They were gone and that was all that mattered. They had given him his life and he would be forever grateful, but he could not dwell on them. Years of doing so at the Dursleys had taught him that such thoughts only led to unshakable bouts of misery.

*"This mirror will give us neither knowledge nor truth, Harry. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. The mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, and I ask you not to go looking for it. If you ever do come across it again, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live. Remember that."*

It took him a moment to locate the dormitories once he returned to inspecting the room. Harry had become so accustomed to looking for stone tunnels that sloped down into the bowels of the castle. Here it was different. There were two sets of stairs that led upwards. It made sense to him that the dormitories were higher in the tower, but it was an amusing contrast. The two houses really were polar opposites; their founders had even designed them as such.

He waited for one of the boys to retreat up the left of the stairs before following. The doors to each dorm were clearly indicated. Harry glanced around the lowly-lit hallway before arming himself with his wand and pointing it at his desired target from underneath the folds of his invisibility cloak.

"Alohomora."

The lock clicked not a second after his whispered incantation and Harry quietly placed a Silencing Charm on the door's hinges before slowly pushing it open.

Everyone slept in their own four poster bed just like in the Slytherin dorms, but the hangings here were crimson red instead of emerald green.

This was going to be the difficult part. Finding Weasley's bed without alerting the entire room to the fact he was here.

Harry listened carefully for anything that might give the boy away. If he snored like he ate, that would be easy enough to follow, but no sounds like that stood out. The only thing Harry could hear that was a bit out of the ordinary was... squeaking?

He listened more carefully. Sure enough, something was squeaking and Harry was flummoxed for a time before he remembered Draco's mocking laughter one day in their first year when he'd learned that Ron Weasley's treasured pet was an old and weathered rat named Scabbers.

He crept slowly towards the squeaking sound. It was coming from behind one of the sets of hangings. Very slowly and as quietly as he could, Harry pulled the hangings aside.

Weasley did not so much as flinch. He just continued lying there with his face buried in the pillow, his arm curled under him, and a thin line of drool protruding from the visible corner of his mouth.

Harry made a face before looking around. It wasn't exactly hard to find. It seemed that Weasley had learned nothing from their first year. Had the dragon incident not taught him that leaving valuable bits of parchment out on one's bedside table was a poor and ill-thought idea?

Harry wasn't complaining. He snatched up the bit of parchment and whirled towards the door, scanning the handwriting as he went.

His eyes nearly bulged out of his head.

*Pipes... it must move through pipes. Myrtle died in the bathroom and swears the last thing she saw were big yellow eyes emerging from near one of the sinks. One of the exits for the monster is in the bathroom. It explains how it moves so stealthily and how no one has been able to pin it down*

Myrtle? That whiny ghost that Pansy so often complained about? She was the one who had died? How had Dumbledore not put that much together?

*"Oh, I more than believe him. I know his claim is true; I have researched it extensively and I do not believe any who were not blessed with Salazar's gift could find the chamber."*

*"You mean Parseltongue?"*

*"Yes, Harry, I mean Parseltongue."*

*"Sir, that means if we found the Chamber, I could---"*

*"No. I would never have you risk yourself in such a way."*

There it was again. Dumbledore protecting him. First, he had needed to wait for the reason why Voldemort had attacked his family. Surely he was owed that explanation. Who was Dumbledore to keep that from him in the first place? Then there was keeping a whole side of Occlumency from him. Still, the topic of passive Occlumency had not arisen again. Then there was this. Endangering Harry and everyone else just by 'keeping him safe.' When was Dumbledore going to realize that the last time he had tried to keep Harry safe, he had subjected him to ten years in the depths of hell, locked away with disgusting creatures whose kind was more fit to lick the grime off of Harry's shoes than they were to rule over him?

Grindelwald had been cruel, but at least he had been honest and he had never coddled Harry. He almost missed those visions now. If he did not fear so intensely for the changes they had brought forth and the voices they had summoned, he might have asked for their return. It would have been nice to escape his own troubles no matter what he was being thrown into. It would have been nice to see that somebody at least cared not for coddling him and making him wait.

It took a titanic effort and an almighty breath for Harry to regain his composure. Dumbledore was not his enemy. He was frustrating but well-meaning. There was just so much stress, so much going on... Harry feared that he would soon snap and be unable to fit the pieces back together.

It was better for now not to think about that and simply to creep his way back out of the Gryffindor common room. There were more pressing things that needed to be attended to.

***Minutes later...***

Harry took the final corridors to Dumbledore's office at a sprint. He heard voices behind him. They might not be able to see him, but they would not fail to notice the headmaster's gargoyle step aside and now was not the time to draw suspicion.

Harry was breathing heavily by the time he ascended into the landing outside Dumbledore's office. He was through the door and inside before the man had time to call for him to enter.

Dumbledore himself jerked his head up from a pile of papers on his desk. Harry was struck by how tired the man looked. The lines in his face seemed deeper somehow and his blue eyes appeared sunken and a touch less vibrant.

"Harry! My goodness, what is it that brings you here at such unlawful hours of the evening? In the midst of a school-wide lockdown at that?"

"I'm... sorry... sir," Harry forced out, still breathing heavily. "Give me detention or whatever if you need to, but... sir, this is important. It's about the Chamber of Secrets."

Dumbledore's postures stiffened and his demeanour shifted all at once. He no longer appeared the old man slumped and weary, but a general who had once conquered one dark lord and led the fight against a second.

"What is it you wish to tell me?" he asked, his eyes twinkling with the intensity of a thousand stars.

"Sir... the chamber. I think I've found it! Well... er, not me, exactly, but---" Harry jumped when a sound came from behind him. For a moment he was unsure of what it was, then, he realized there had been a knock at the door.

Dumbledore looked from Harry to the invisibility cloak he had discarded as he stepped into the room and the Slytherin youth got the message, scrambling back under the cloak as Dumbledore turned his attention to the door.

"Enter."

Two men stepped into the office. Harry realized with an internal curse that they must have been the two voices he had heard while on the way.

The first man was one whom Harry recognized well. Tall and graceful, with long blonde hair and storm grey eyes was Lord Lucius Malfoy. He was swathed in a black travelling cloak and leaning leisurely on his serpentine cane as he eyed Dumbledore with an expression Harry had never seen the man wear before. It reminded him of Dudley any time he had Harry cornered in some sort of alleyway.

The other man was new to him. He was almost a head shorter than Mr. Malfoy and he moved with none of his grace. He was a portly man with a mess of rumpled hair. There were specs of brown here and there, but it had long since begun to grey and time had won out. The most striking feature of the man was the cap he had swept off his head upon entering the room and now held under his arm. A vivid, lime-green bowler cap.

"Good evening, Lucius," Dumbledore said with a passive expression before turning his eyes on the other man. "You as well, Cornelius."

Harry jolted at the name. He couldn't mean... but it had to be. Someone named Cornelius accompanying one of the most important men in the country to Hogwarts in the dead of night? This could be no one but the Minister for Magic. Harry had never seen him before, but the man looked underwhelming. He was the last of the three men in the room who Harry would have guessed was the minister upon a first glance.

"Dreadful thing, Dumbledore," Mr. Malfoy said lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, "but the Hogwarts Board of Governors feel it is time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension --- you'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch. How many attacks have there been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn't it? At this rate, there will be no muggleborns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school."

Dumbledore looked to Fudge as though he expected the man to object, but he didn't. Harry himself almost did, but crushed the impulse.

This could not be happening. If Voldemort was behind this, Dumbledore was the one man who stood any chance of putting an end to it. And now, of all times? Harry had the answers in his hand! Dumbledore could investigate right now if they would only allow him!

 "Interesting that you come to me now. The attacks have been happening for quite some time. What has changed, Lucius?"

"We do not owe you our justification, Dumbledore."

"Of course not, but if you will excuse what may be taken as arrogance, I do not plan to stay suspended long. I wish to know how I might improve my performance upon returning to the castle."

Harry thought he could see Mr. Malfoy bite his lip to stop it from curling. "Read the paper tomorrow morning. I'm sure it will have a number of suggestions for you."

"Ah, yes, the paper. I do hope Miss Skeeter does not slander your good intentions based on today's events."

Mr. Malfoy's eyes narrowed. "And why would she do that?"

"Rita will do what Rita does. She could very easily latch onto the fact that the action came so swiftly after a friend of your son was targeted."

The smile the Malfoy patriarch offered Dumbledore was as cold and hard as a frozen lake. "I appreciate your concern, but it is not necessary. I'm sure dear Rita would never harm my reputation. She seems quite busy at the moment at any rate. I am quite excited to read your biography."

"I am humbled by your interest." Dumbledore dipped his head before casting his eyes about the room. They landed on the exact spot Harry was standing. Dumbledore seemed to stare at him for a moment before shaking his head so minutely that Harry was unsure he had seen it. Was it a signal to do nothing? How could Harry stand by and allow them to remove the only chance he had at removing what could potentially be a threat to his life?

The choice was immediately taken away from him. There was a nearly imperceptible movement under Dumbledore's robes and Harry felt his arms and legs snap together. He tried to open his mouth, but he couldn't as he slumped back against the wall behind him. Dumbledore had sensed his unease and bound him against speaking before his restraint could waver.

"If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course stand aside." His eyes were still on Harry as he spoke. "However, you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it."

"A sentiment to be proud of," Mr. Malfoy said with a short bow. "Now, it is late, Dumbledore. I have come to deliver the news and Cornelius was kind enough to join me as the ministry's witness to the event. Please follow us, if you will."

Harry could do little more than watch on with panic and a strong sense of helplessness as Dumbledore was led from the office that was rightfully his. Not until the men must have been some distance away from the castle did Harry feel the spell's effects lift.

He slumped against the wall and buried his head in his hands. What was he to do now? He could not go after this Heir of Slytherin and their monster on his own. Who else would help him? Flitwick, maybe, but Harry did not trust the man with something as important as this. This was not a question about Charms or magical theory. This was a life or death situation that Harry would not be taking up with anyone he did not trust.

Eliminating Flitwick left only Snape, a thought that was even more laughable. The man despised him and would probably break out into song if the monster swallowed Harry whole.

No, he would have to wait. He would have to write to Dumbledore and explain things. All he could do then was hope to hear a reply before it was too late.

***May 15, 1993***

***The Library***

***10:23 PM***

"I think we should head back to our common rooms," Diana told Luna as the hour grew late.

The lockdown had reluctantly been lifted in the castle on Monday morning. The students were escorted to and from classes, but the teachers still allowed them to use the library, though few did.

Diana thought it was madness. If the teachers didn't trust them to attend classes on their own, she didn't understand why they were allowed in the library other than to prepare for the end-of-year exams. She had never realized how much those meant to the professors until this year, but she was not complaining. She'd had a lot on her plate this year between Luna, Draco, a social life that grew more complicated by the day, and of course, this business concerning the Chamber of Secrets and the alleged Heir of Slytherin.

"Do we have to?" asked Luna. "They've extended curfew by an hour until exams so we can prepare."

"I would rather not cut it close. Not with whatever lunatic is roaming around the halls and not with how strict everything is right now. Can you imagine what one of the professors would do if they caught students out after curfew?"

Luna stared unblinkingly back at her. "They would probably be nicer than my housemates."

There was no bitterness in her voice. No anger, not even sadness. It was just said matter-of-factly, as though it was a prediction about some sort of upcoming Quidditch match or something of the like.

"What about your housemates?" asked Diana with narrowed eyes. "Luna, have they been giving you trouble again?"

"Oh, yes," she said in that dreamy way of hers. "My things keep going missing. Marietta swears that no one is stealing them, but I don't think I believe her. Her wrackspurts act up any time she lies and there were a lot of them when she said that." Luna paused and suddenly began drumming her finger upon the edge of the table. "Well, I suppose they also act up any time she thinks really hard about something. Maybe she was just trying to remember---"

"Oh, for Merlin's sake," Diana cut her off. "Luna, you have to stop letting people do things to you like that. Here, I'll take you to your common room and get things sorted. If they don't listen to me, I'll go to Cassie."

"Cassie? I don't know a Cassie, but that's a pretty name. Tell her I like it."

"Her name is actually Cassandra. We all just call her Cassie and she's one of the fifth-year prefects, but... I'll pass your message along."

Luna hummed, then skipped to her feet and looked expectantly at Diana, who blinked, smiled vaguely, and followed.

"Cassandra isn't as pretty as Cassie," Luna said as they left the library, "I'm not quite sure I like that as much. Tell her she should get her name changed to Cassie. I like that one."

***Meanwhile, in the dungeons...***

Harry had found himself walking the halls of Hogwarts often since Dumbledore had been driven from the castle. The reason why eluded him. Perhaps he was hoping that answers also frequently broke curfew and would stumble into him along the way, or perhaps he simply needed to escape other people and at least feel like he was trying to decide what to do?

There was just... nothing.

He had written to Dumbledore, but there had been no reply as of yet. Harry wondered where the man had travelled to if he had still not been able to receive and return a simple letter. The temptation to go to Snape was becoming stronger and stronger by the day, but Harry feared the man would dismiss him outright. If he did, he would watch Harry more closely and sneaking out after more harshly enforced curfews would become even more difficult.

It was the most frustrating thing in the world. Harry was terrified and had no one to turn to. It was like all those years on Privet Drive all over again. Hoping in vain for a saviour who would never come.

**"Blood... I smell blood. The right blood... the demanded blood. Rip... tear... kill!"**

Harry froze as all colour fled from his skin. It was the voice again; the same one that had haunted his nightmares for months and indicated what could be the beginning of a descent into insanity.

Except there was something...

Different.

**"Closer... closer... come to me. Let me rip you... let me tear you... let me kill you!"**

It wasn't in his head. His eyes widened like saucers when the realization slammed into him with speed and force the likes of which Dobby's cursed bludger could only dream of.

It was not him! He wasn't going mad! Grindelwald had failed to drive him mad!

He laughed right there in the corridor for a moment before his mind caught up. It was a crazed, maniacal laugh that escaped him in a wild howl as his body was wracked with its intensity. This was euphoric. The lightest he had felt since escaping the Dursleys last summer.

The voice was moving! It could not possibly be in his head, for it was moving swiftly away from him.

**"...blood!"**

It was growing fainter now but Harry's heart had started beating fiercely as a new question sprang to life inside his mind.

What the hell *was* that voice and why could he hear it back in September when Aberforth could not?

That was when it struck him like the very same bolt of lightning that so closely resembled his world-famous scar. It struck him at the same moment that a horrible, high-pitched scream tore through the corridors with such explosive vigour Harry thought glass might shatter.

*"Oh, I more than believe him. I know his claim is true; I have researched it extensively and I do not believe any who were not blessed with Salazar's gift could find the chamber."*

*"You mean Parseltongue?"*

*"Yes, Harry, I mean Parseltongue."*

Oh... FUCK!

The monster in the Chamber of Secrets --- it was a snake!

It was the only thing that made sense. A mysterious voice that only Harry could hear, one that moved through walls and seemed capable only of shrewd calls for blood, mutilation, and death.

Of course it was a fucking snake! It was Salazar Slytherin's fabled monster!

But that meant...

He remembered the night Cadmus Yaxley had sought a fight with him, remembered how the snakes upon the sofa had come alive with a single hiss, and remembered how, even now, they were loyal to him.

The answer was so simple. It was Parseltongue!

Without thinking, Harry tore off in the direction of the hissing and screaming.

***A minute or so later, in Severus Snape's office...***

The last week had been the most stressful Ron could remember. Never had he felt so weighed down by everything in his life. He constantly felt on the verge of vomiting because his stomach was tied so tightly in anxious knots.

The scroll of parchment from Hermione had been stolen that first night he had slept after taking it. There was no other solution. It could not have simply been lost; Ron had scoured every inch of the dormitory not once, not twice, but thrice. He had even looked around as much of the common room as he could and it had been nowhere.

Yet not even that had been the worst occurrence of the past seven days.

Dumbledore had been removed from his position in the middle of the night and was no longer even dwelling in the castle. The one man who Ron could take his grievances to was nowhere to be found and this left him with very few options.

Ron had done the only thing he could think of --- explore the bathroom for himself.

He had spent a frantic hour scrambling around the place before he remembered what Hermione had done and called upon Moaning Myrtle. Convincing her to speak had taken some time, but she had eventually pointed him in the right direction, and there it was --- a subtle, serpentine carving upon one of the taps.

The trouble was, Ron had no idea what to do next. He had researched as many opening and revealing spells as he could, but none of them seemed to make the sink budge and last night, he had finally decided that it would take someone much more skillful than him to crack the code and hopefully put an end to this madness.

His first choice would have been Professor Flitwick, but the man had fallen ill and was not taking any visitors.

That left Ron with only one option...

"Enter," called the newly appointed Interim Headmaster of Hogwarts when Ron knocked upon his door.

The office was as horrible as always. Sick-looking green things dangling from the ceiling and odd, misshapen objects swimming in murky liquid and thick, slimy concoctions in floating vials all around the room.

Snape himself was burdened with several rolls of parchment longer than his hair. His black eyes narrowed as his lips pulled into that trademarked sneer of his as he inspected Ron with clear disdain.

"What is so urgent that you felt the need to disturb the master of this castle, Weasley?"

"It's important," Ron defended, his face flushing with furious impatience.

"So important that you could not have taken it up with your standing Head of House---"

"I know where Slytherin's monster is coming from!" Ron blurted so loudly it echoed off the walls. "It might even be the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."

It was the first time Ron had ever seen Snape look surprised. The expression was present on his face for only a second, but it was the most viciously satisfied Ron had been in a very long time.

"And where do you believe this to be?" Snape asked in a sickeningly soft tone of voice.

"The out-of-order girls' bathroom on the second floor, it's---"

"Idiot boy!" Snape snarled. "Is this a joke to you, Weasley?"

"P-Professor---"

"You come here and interrupt my business with the illusion of presenting a real solution to a serious problem---"

"Sir, I---"

"Silence! You will not interrupt me again! You come here under the guise of nobility and throw this nonsense in my face? Is this a twisted joke on the behalf of you and the dimwitted imbeciles you call brothers?"

"Sir, I'm not---"

"You come to me, the long-time Head of Slytherin House and spout off this nonsense that Slytherin's noble founder would choose that hovel for his---" Snape stopped talking all at once as a terrified scream tore through the dungeons.

It was of a pitch so high, a Mandrake would have been proud. It came from a meaningful distance away, but Ron could tell it had emanated from the dungeons.

So could Snape, for he took to his feet, armed himself with his wand, and stormed out his office door without even bothering to see if Ron had stayed or followed.

The redhead looked from the door, to the desk, and back again, before snarling with livid frustration and sprinting after his rapidly-moving headmaster.

***Elsewhere in the dungeons...***

Harry's lungs were burning by the time he reached the place from which he thought the scream had come. It had to be here, for it was a dead end with no branching corridors.

Yet there was nothing.

There was no snake and no victim, just an empty stretch of wall...

Harry's blood turned to ice as his breath caught in his throat.

It was an empty stretch of wall splattered with familiar-looking red letters.

*Their skeletons will lie in the chamber forever.*

The words made no sense. Whose skeleton? What was happening? Then, Harry's senses picked up two equally disturbing things.

There were three pieces of jewelry strewn about the floor at his feet. The first two, he did not recognize. They appeared to be strangely-shaped earrings, but there was some sort of... something dangling off of them. It almost resembled vegetation, but it was no vegetable that Harry had ever seen.

The other...

His heaving breath caught in his throat when he saw it. A splendid, ornate ring adorned with a crest that was all too familiar --- a ring the likes of which important, pureblood heirs and heiresses would wear around their fingers.

But that was not all.

Something was moving behind Harry. He could hear it approaching and approaching fast. His only thought now was whether or not he would soon be joining Diana and whoever was unfortunate enough to have been attacked alongside her.

***May 15, 1993***

***The Dungeons***

***10:54 PM***

Ron skidded around the corner so fast that he almost fell. His nerveless feet rendered movement difficult. It felt as though they had frozen in a cold winter's snow, but he knew that was not the case. They had frozen for entirely different reasons.

There had been another attack.

There was no other possibility. Ron had known it in his heart the second he had heard the terrible scream. Snape must have known as well as him, for Ron had never imagined the old bat could move so fast. His cloak whipped behind him as he ran through the corridors, the Gryffindor youth hot on his heels.

Both of them were breathing heavily by the time they came to a dead-end corridor whose wall was splashed with familiar red writing.

*Their skeletons will lie in the chamber forever.*

"This is too far," Ron heard Snape whisper. There was an edge to his voice that Ron had never heard there. Oftentimes it was smooth as silk, but now it seemed as jagged as the rough face of a steep and rocky cliff.

"Professor? Who was petrified?"

Snape must have seen something Ron didn't because he stooped and picked something off the floor. Two somethings. Strange earrings with things hanging from them that Ron had never seen. Well... he had seen something similar, but not quite that.

"They look like earrings a friend of my sister's used to wear."

Snape had ignored his existence since leaving his office, but finally, the man looked back and met his eyes. "Who is this friend you speak of?"

"Luna Lovegood."

Snape's expression remained impassive, but Ron could see the vein in his jaw pulse. "That is part of your answer," he said.

"Part?"

"'Their skeletons', Weasley. It implies more than one victim."

Ron's sharp eyes swept around the corridor. He had become accustomed to finding a small speck of gold when no one else could, but he found nothing more in that corridor.

Snape was turning now, looking all around them but still he saw nothing. "You will return to your common room if you value your life," he said.

"Sir! I know where the---"

"Enough of your games, Weasley."

"Sir, I---"

"Can you not see that the time for them has long-since passed?

"I'm not---"

"This has escalated too far and I must take steps towards putting an end to this madness. Dumbledore must know and this castle must be locked down. Now, begone!"

Ron wanted so badly to argue. This was the most foolish thing a professor had ever done. McGonagall dismissing their concerns last year had been one thing, but this? He knew where the monster was coming from. Surely that same place could lead them down into the Chamber of Secrets. They could retrieve the stolen students and confront the Heir of Slytherin. It was the only way they were ever going to put an end to this lunacy.

Yet Snape would hear none of it and Ron knew that. The man would never let him finish, let alone take heed of what he was told. Snape was stubborn in his ways and his mind would remain unchanged. Ron was just a petulant child who knew nothing and understood too little to be of any use.

Arguing with the interim headmaster would do neither him nor the victims any good. Professor McGonagall was petrified, Professor Flitwick was so ill he was not seeing students, and Ron doubted any of the other professors would heed him.

That left him only one option.

He was going to need to find a way to reveal whatever passage the monster was using in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. It was the only way; he would wait until the beast next appeared and slip in after it had left if need be. The madness had to end.

***Minutes later, in the Slytherin common room...***

The Slytherin common room was packed to capacity, but Draco could hear nothing but the vast emptiness of ringing silence. Never had he heard this room so noiseless. The only sounds that hung in the air were the collective breaths of all gathered.

Draco could feel something red-hot rising up within him.

They had all known something had happened when Professor Snape had announced via his magically amplified voice that the castle was in a full and complete lockdown --- and that any caught outside their common rooms would be expelled. That was far stricter than any lockdown that had come before it, so all of them knew something dire had happened.

Another attack, no doubt, and the room had been on edge. The last two victims had not been muggleborns, but Slytherins; and purebloods, the both of them. No one was safe; that was clearer now than ever.

There were two students missing when the heads had all been counted and Draco's blood had run cold even then.

Diana and Harry.

The prefects had all done their best to stay calm in hopes the room would mimic them. It wasn't all that late. Not with exams approaching and Harry's known aptitude for disappearing and showing up again that next morning despite never having been seen re-entering the common room.

There were dark whispers, of course. Whispers about how Harry was taking out his friends one by one. He was the Heir of Slytherin, after all. Zabini had once called him a friend, as had Pansy, and now Diana.

Draco did not believe a word of it.

Harry was many things and Draco wished he was many more. He wished that Harry was more patient and also more defensive. Perhaps then he might have talked him down back in September, back before all had gone completely off the rails. Draco wished Harry was less stubborn than himself. Perhaps then, they would not have remained at such a painful impasse for so long. Draco wished he was more forgiving, but that last one he understood. He had been lucky to win Harry's forgiveness back last year. Diana had told him so and she had been right, but that did not mean that he couldn't wish for it now.

Draco knew Harry well. He had made foolish choices and passed judgement with ill thought, but he knew Harry perhaps better than any other.

Harry Potter was not the Heir of Slytherin.

He might seem cold and distant to everyone else and to some extent, it was even true. Many nights Harry had abandoned them to go sloping off on his own, but that was just his way. Draco's father was much the same; he had grown up with that, he understood it well.

Harry cared for his friends even if he did not wish to spend every passing minute with them. He had been prepared to second Draco in a duel he did not understand, he had attacked Weasley for Pansy back in September, and he had even spared Draco from... whatever had happened in the common room the night of Yule. There had been selfish motives in the last, but Draco had not missed the look in his eyes. A part of Harry had still cared, at least back then.

He would not attack his friends in the way that some suggested. Certainly not Diana, who had never ceased showing him kindness.

So the question was --- where was Harry, and where was Diana?

The answer became more and more obvious as time ticked by. Draco's eyes watched the entrance to the Slytherin common room, but it never gave way and admitted neither of them entrance. Dread built in his stomach. It swelled like a great and terrible bruise but it throbbed with pain that was far greater than he had ever imagined. It was pain unlike anything he had ever felt before. Pain so raw and all-consuming he could think of nothing else.

His legs shook underneath him as he took to his feet. His mind whirled in chaotic circles as he felt something sting at the corner of his eyes and saw his vision blur just a bit near the edges. He would not cry here. Not in front of all his housemates. He was Draco Malfoy, the youngest son of Lord Lucius Malfoy. He did not let emotions like this conquer him --- especially not in front of a room filled with so many others.

Nobody called after him as he marched towards the common room's exit with as much dignity as he could muster. Snape's warning of expulsion had all but fled his thoughts by the time he was out of the room. Only then did he pause and think.

What was he to do?

Harry was his first instinct. The Boy-Who-Lived was a Parselmouth even if he was not the Heir of Slytherin. Surely that meant something when dealing with Salazar Slytherin's monster, right?

But that was no good. Harry had no reason to heed him and even if he did, Draco knew not where he was, nor how to find him. He didn't even know what he would say when he did. Draco knew nothing of the Chamber of Secrets or how to find it. What would he say? 'Can you help me get into this chamber in a location I don't know?' It was madness.

The only thing he knew about the Chamber of Secrets was that it had been opened fifty years ago. A muggleborn had died and whoever had opened the chamber had been both caught and expelled.

It was almost no information to work with. It had all been kept very quiet and Draco would never have known had his grandfather not attended Hogwarts at that time. All students had been urged never to speak of it and the staff had pretended it had never happened the very next year.

Perhaps if Draco knew more of that, there would have been something he could do. Even if he knew where the victim had died. If this monster was of great size, he doubted it moved far. That would at least narrow down a location, but how was he to find one? Decades had passed since that fateful day. Nobody at the castle now knew what had happened, and even if they did, they had no reason to tell Draco.

Except... there were beings that did know exactly what had happened. Whether or not they would tell Draco... that was another matter altogether. Surely only one of them would even consider it and he was someone who Draco had pointedly avoided ever since that first night at the welcoming feast. Ever since he had sat beside him and seen the way his life's blood clung to him like a second layer of skin.

But what other choice did he have?

Draco sniffed and shuddered, biting back tears the best he could. It was now or never.

***Meanwhile...***

Harry barely had enough time to snatch Diana's ring before the two figures were upon him. First, he had expected the Heir of Slytherin and their vaunted monster. When it became clear that was not who approached, he then expected to be caught out. Harry had actually been confused when their eyes had skipped over him. It took several seconds before he realised he was still covered in the silvery fabric of his invisibility cloak.

Still his heart beat as he watched Weasley and Snape. Any doubts he might have had over not going to the interim headmaster with the information he had were crushed there and then. Weasley was shrugged off as though he was little more than an insect.

It made Harry livid. All of it made Harry livid. Adults as a concept made him livid. They were held above children and put in positions of power, yet all Harry had ever known at their hands was negligence, foolishness, or utter torment. Only Dumbledore had served as an exception thus far, but even he had been a fool to place him with the Dursleys. Narcissa had been unwaveringly kind to him, but there was always the chance she was as scheming as he suspected her husband to be.

Professors would not be solving this problem. They had made that obvious to him, but it needed to be solved.

Shock had befallen him when he had found Diana's ring. Shock so heavy that his knees had buckled beneath its oppressive weight. He knelt on the floor whilst Weasley and Snape traipsed about the corridor and argued like petulant children while the Heir of Slytherin made off with Diana and, Harry supposed, Luna Lovegood if Weasley was to be believed.

Diana was his oldest friend. She had shown him kindness sooner than even Draco, but hers had never waned. It still shone as brightly as the sun despite Draco's having dimmed and died altogether ages ago. Diana helped him learn to have friends. She, Cassius, and Cassie had been the only ones who had never let him down. Whether she was caught up in whatever scheme her family might be running or not, she meant something to Harry. Something he could not quantify through words or thoughts, but something that tore at him like a rabid dog trapped unwillingly in a small and shabby kennel.

The pain started in Harry's stomach before spreading outwards. It was like there was another invisible figure in the corridor who had stabbed him roughly through the gut. It was a piercing sort of pain that made his stomach ache and his intestines curl under the weight of loss and sorrow. It rose into his chest and his heart felt fit to tear before the feeling reached his throat. He was back at Saint Bartholomew's church again, standing atop the pyre in Grindelwald's body as acrid smoke wafted up around him in billowing clouds so thick that they obscured his vision. This feeling wrapped around his throat and choked him just as the horrid smoke had choked Grindelwald more than a century ago. Drawing breath was suddenly as arduous as it had been while climbing walls and the like to get away from Dudley as a child. Every heaving breath made black spots dance before his eyes as the room spun on its axis like a child's top.

The realization he came to then was one that caused something else to settle in the pit of his stomach.

Harry would do anything to set Diana free. She was one of only three true friends he had left. Theodore too, but that was only when Draco was not watching. Pansy seemed even further away, lying prone and unmoving on her soft bed in the hospital wing.

Harry hated it. He hated much about this year, but that ranked highly. The feeling of loneliness. He had needed time to himself when he had been friends with Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, Theodore, and Pansy. He had needed it often, but that was different. *Being* alone was one thing, but *feeling* alone was another altogether.

It was always meant to end this way, he realized. Voldemort had wanted for it to be this way ever since Harry had vanquished him at the end of his first year. Framing him, setting his own friends against him, taking Pansy and now Diana away from him. It was all meant to draw him in. Dumbledore had said that any plan Voldemort hatched at Hogwarts would have Harry in mind, and now he knew what the old man had meant.

Yet Dumbledore was gone. Vanquished by that same plan and forced untold miles away. The former headmaster was in no position to help Harry vanquish Voldemort again or to deal with whatever pawn he was using in his stead. The man had yet to even answer Harry's letter.

He would need to go to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. There were no two ways about it. None of the professors would help him and he doubted any student could. For all of Cassie's prowess with a wand, Harry feared she would be little help against the serpentine monster of Salazar Slytherin. Harry was at least a Parselmouth. That was something. Snakes had always obeyed him without a second thought. Perhaps he could take control of Slytherin's monster, if not at least keep it away from him long enough to retrieve Diana and maybe even ambush the Heir of Slytherin.

It was a crazy plan. The Heir could be anyone. It could be a seventh year of prodigious skill for all Harry knew. His best course was surely to retrieve Diana and take her to the professors as proof. Maybe then they would help him; maybe then somebody would be able to face this monster.

That sat worst with him. Of all the things about this that bothered Harry, that had to be right at the top.

By now, he had accepted that he was going to take a leap of faith he knew was foolish, to go try and save Diana, yet Harry knew nothing about what he was facing. He knew not who this Heir of Slytherin was, nor did he know a thing about the monster they controlled.

That was truly what bothered him. What if Granger had been wrong and it wasn't a snake at all? It made sense, but what if? His entire plan hinged on the fact that the monster would heed him because he was a Parselmouth. Even that was next to nothing, but if that proved untrue...

Harry's throat constricted even tighter when he realized there was no way for him to know. Too much time had passed and there was little left to spare. He would need to take the chance and hope all was well once this bout of emotions had passed and once he could breathe again. He reached for his Occlumency to pull it under control, but then...

His eyes had been closed for some time against the spinning of the room, but they shot open now like he had been awoken from a deep dream by the touch of ice cold water.

There was a way for him to learn what this monster was. There was at least a hope that he could learn, though it relied on something he did not wish to do.

But what choice did he have?

Diana was worth it, surely, and if Voldemort truly wanted him dead, Harry needed to put a stop to whatever was going on. Hogwarts grew more perilous by the day; he could only imagine what would become of the castle if this all continued to escalate.

His heart was beating faster than it had in many moons. This was perhaps more foolish than facing the unknown in the Chamber of Secrets, but he would have to deal with its repercussions later. For now, he needed this and he knew it. Harry hated it, but there was no denying its truth.

The pendant still hung on Regulus Black's chain, but it was ice cold where Regulus's gift was warm against his skin. This had always felt cold. Perhaps it was reflective of the man who had given it to him, or perhaps it was a mark of the magic that had been used. Harry did not know, but it filled him with foreboding as he fingered the pendant and closed his eyes, clearing his mind of all thought and hoping that everything around him would fade away.

It happened faster and easier than he had expected.

His eyes were still closed when the voice drifted towards him, but he did not miss a single syllable and could picture the small, dark room easily enough.

"What a surprise," said Gellert Grindelwald, though Harry could hear a smirk. "You have returned at last."

***Atop the Astronomy Tower...***

The trip up to the Astronomy Tower's peak had been one of the longest treks of Draco's short life. Never had he felt like he was moving so slowly. It was like his limbs had been filled with sand and like he had been climbing the long, spiralling staircase attached to the tower all the way.

The air bit at him when he did finally step outside. It was cold for May. The air itself was warm enough, but the late-spring breeze had an unexpected bite that made Draco shiver. The moon was nearing full, much of it obscured behind a thick layer of dense grey clouds that hid it from vision.

Draco cared naught for the clouds, nor the wind, nor even for the moon. Nothing his eyes could see or his skin could feel meant anything to him. It was his ears that mattered and he listened hard, hoping beyond hope that he had not come here in vain.

And there it was. The telltale clinking sound he had been waiting for. The one that many had complained about during the two years he had spent so far at Hogwarts. To him, it was both the most terrifying and most beautiful sound he had ever heard. It drew him in like a flickering fire might a band of swarming moths, but his stomach quivered harder and harder with every step he took. He crept around the perimeter of the tower's peak and out into its centre.

The Bloody Baron was there. Dark, iron chains hung from his hands as he clinked them loudly together over and over again. His back was to Draco but in the dim light of the night, he shone brighter even than the half-obscured moon.

"Baron!" Draco called; he could think of no other way to get the ghost's attention.

The chains stopped clinking for a moment before the ghost turned to face him. Draco shuddered at the sight; the Baron had always unnerved him. Those eyes seemed darker than the night all around them and his face was gaunter than any corpse. Ghosts were supposed to look like the men they represented at the moment of death, but the Baron looked like he had been dead for many years before his spirit returned. Draco might even have thought that was true if not for the fresh stains of silvery blood splattered upon robes as dark as his eyes.

The two of them faced each other, student and ghost. Draco felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up, but he did not waver. He would not show fear now. One did not need to wear crimson and gold to be brave; he was a Malfoy, that alone was more than enough.

"You sought me?" The Baron's voice was deep and rumbling. Draco didn't know why he had expected it to be broken and rasping. No ghost he'd ever known had sounded that way, but it was what he had braced for.

"I did," Draco said boldly.

The Baron watched him very closely. "It has been a long time since anyone has."

"I need your help," Draco said. He hated the way his voice trembled and nearly broke. It threatened to catch in his throat, but he had forced it out through willpower alone.

He felt the first tremor run up his body and cursed. *Not here,* he thought, *not now.* There was a time and a place to break down. In the midst of this chaos and in front of the vaunted Bloody Baron was not it.

Rather than looking disgusted by his weakness, the Baron's expression changed in a different way. "Why have you come?" he asked, and his voice was quieter this time.

"I need your help," Draco spoke louder and clearer this time, wiping a half-formed tear from the corner of his eye.

"I turned away the last boy who asked for my aid," the Baron said stiffly. Draco thought he sounded almost bitter. "I will not help you find the treasure that boy sought."

"Treasure?" asked Draco. "I'm not looking for treasure." He hesitated before speaking the word his father had so often told him he was above, throwing it at the Baron like an axe meant to kill. "Please!" Draco begged. "My sister's been taken by the Heir of Slytherin. I need to find the Chamber of Secrets."

The Baron's expression remained blank, but Draco thought the ghost stiffened if such a thing was even possible. "I cannot help you," he said after another pause. "I have never known where Salazar hid his chamber."

"But you must know something," Draco pleaded. Tears had come again, but this time, he could not fight them. He shivered as they fell from his eyes and hung cold against his cheeks in the night's bitter wind. "I-I need to f-find my s-sister. PLEASE!"

The Bloody Baron watched him with those cold black eyes just as the clouds overhead parted and the tower was suddenly bathed in a halo of silvery light. It made those seem even darker, especially now that the ghost did not seem to shine quite so bright. Draco could see right through him. The constellation Ophiuchus shone down straight through the Baron. He was like a looking glass through which Draco could observe the night sky and one of the first constellations he had ever known; a tall figure holding a serpent in each hand.

Then, the Baron spoke and Draco's breath caught in his throat as he remembered a hundred of Pansy's rants that all made sense in a single, dizzying moment.

"The mudblood died in the bathroom she still haunts."

***Elsewhere...***

"Not for you," said Harry.

The first thing Harry saw when he properly opened his eyes was the upward curve of Grindelwald's lips. "No, I think not. You have come not for me, but to ask something of me."

"Will you answer," asked Harry, "or am I wasting my time?"

"Time in the company of wise men is never wasted." Grindelwald must have seen the way Harry was glaring at him even though the room was near pitch-black. "I will answer," he said. "I promised you that I would, and I am a man of my word." His eyes gleamed in the low light of the room. They were blue as the eyes of death but with a silvery hew about them. "I will answer," he repeated, "but I have conditions you will agree to before I do."

Dread clamped down on Harry's heart like an iron vice. "I thought you said you already promised to answer."

"And so I did. You will find this to be true if you search your memory." His lips were smirking again. "I think you will also find that I never promised I would not have conditions of my own."

"Fine," said Harry. What was he to do? There was nothing for it. Diana's life hung in the balance and his might well also. "What are your conditions?"

"I will leave you in peace until the school year's end and allow you to recover from all you have been through." Harry waited patiently for the metaphorical penny to drop. "Once your school year concludes, you will allow me to share my past once again. You will take it in objectively. You will not fear what you feel, but instead, you will ponder it. You will allow it to wash over you and we will discuss it. I will not lead you. I will answer any questions you might have. Whether they may be about me, the time, my thoughts, or even some of the magic you see. But you will watch and you will not complain. You will speak with me and you will not cringe away. This is my price, Harry Potter. Take it, or leave it."

Harry could hear the wind whistling fiercely outside the tower. It was a wonder the floor did not lurch underneath his feet. The bars shuddered in their frames as the cool air blew off of Lake Königssee and into the small prison cell Harry shared with the former dark lord.

"Fine," he said through gritted teeth. "I accept your terms."

"As I knew you would," said Grindelwald, folding his hands in his lap and peering at Harry with those bright and piercing eyes. "Now, tell me what ails you."

"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened at Hogwarts. I'm not sure if you---"

"I am aware of the legend, yes. I took quite an interest in all things of that nature as a teen, as you yourself have seen."

Myths and legends, yes. Grindelwald had read many of them. The story of the Hallows was the one that had consumed him most, but there were others, too. Many of them featured a wand much like that which Death had granted Antioch Peverell, but there were some more varied legends sprinkled here and there.

"The chamber has been opened," Harry said again.

"You are sure of this?"

"Positive."

"Very well. Continue."

"Students have been turning up petrified."

"Petrified?"

"Yes, petrified. They're alive, but they're frozen. Their pulse is there, but they're completely unresponsive. Nothing will wake them up or counter the spell except Mandrake Draught. That's being brewed by the Herbology Professor and it's almost ready, but this has been happening for months. Can you think of any monster that could have caused it?"

"Tell me more," said Grindelwald, drumming his fingers upon his knee as he stared out the open window, looking upon the clear, star-lit sky above.

"The monster's probably a snake and it's moving through the pipes. I know that it's coming from a bathroom. The first attack was outside that room. A cat was petrified and there was water everywhere."

"What can you tell me about the other attacks?"

"The second was a boy with a camera. The film inside was smoking when Dumbledore took it out." Harry saw something flash in the old sorcerer's eyes at the mention of his rival. Harry could not tell what, but it didn't matter, nor was it a surprise. Dumbledore was the reason Grindelwald was here, after all.

"How many attacks have there been?" asked Grindelwald

"Four more. The next one was a professor. She was attacked near the Great Hall. The next was a student attacked near a mirror on the third floor. Two people got attacked next time out. One was in the dungeons and was found near a suit of armour. The last one was near the bathroom again."

"That is three if you are counting the one with two victims as a single strike," said Grindelwald.

"Tonight was... different."

"How so?"

"I don't know if they were petrified, because they were just taken. The Heir of Slytherin said that their skeletons would lie in the chamber forever."

"And you wish to prevent this?"

"Yes," said Harry. "One of them... she's one of the only friends I have left."

Grindelwald was thinking hard, Harry could see. This appeared far more difficult for him than getting Harry out of his relatives' house. The moon had moved some in the sky since Harry's arrival and the cell became suddenly illuminated by its silvery light. Harry could see Grindelwald more clearly now and track the path of his stare. He appeared to be looking up at a shining constellation. The stars coiled across the sky to form the vague outline of a long and powerful serpent. Serpens, Harry remembered. It was one of the constellations they had covered in Astronomy.

"Tell me more about the third attack," Grindelwald said slowly. "The one with the professor."

"What about it?"

"Describe to me where it happened. What was the area like?"

"Uh... it was in a corridor. An open corridor connecting the Entrance Hall to the Great Hall."

"Were there any windows?"

That struck Harry as quite an odd question, but he nodded slowly. "Near the front doors, yeah. Close to where Professor McGonagall was found."

Grindelwald did not take his eyes off Serpens for some time. When he did, there was a look about them Harry had never seen before; an intensity that glued him to the spot and sent a tremor running up his spine.

"I believe I have discovered the monster. If you must face it, you will listen closely to me before you do."

Harry leant forward, eyes wide with anticipation as he nodded.

***Minutes later, on the second floor...***

"GAHHHHHH!"

Ron could do nothing but scream. He had been at it now for the better part of an hour, but nothing had changed. Just like every time he had come here this past week, nothing had changed. He was sure he had found it --- the serpentine carving on one of the taps could be nothing but the secret passage he was looking for --- but opening it still seemed as distant a goal as making the World Cup winning catch for England.

Ron brought his fist down so hard against one of the faucets that it clattered down into the empty sink below. Ron snatched it, turned on his heel, and threw it at the wall with such force that it shattered into a dozen crystal pieces.

He was shaking so violently that he could hardly stand. Ron bent double over the sink, closed his eyes, and allowed deep, shuddering breaths to escape him one by one.

This was ridiculous! He had been here every day for a week; what had he expected to change? He had not found any new spell nor birthed any new ideas. All was the same, yet he had expected a different result. He was every bit as delusional as he had been the night they went after the Philosopher's Stone. Just in a way that was somehow even more painful.

"Having a breakdown, Weasley?"

Ron flinched so badly that he smacked his own nose off the bowl of the sink. A thin line of blood trickled from his nostril and stained the crystal sink crimson.

Draco Malfoy was standing in the doorway, his blond hair gleaming in the low light of the room. His face was less pale than usual; it was oddly red and his eyes seemed puffy for some reason or another. It was a less impressive figure than the boy usually struck, but Ron could not will himself to care about him. There were things so much more important than a stupid, childish spat with a git who didn't matter.

"Shove off, Mal---"

"Shut your mouth, you filthy blood traitor!" Ron stiffened and went for his wand, but Malfoy's next words hit him so hard that he nearly toppled into the row of sinks that were now at his back. "How about you stand back as *your* sister gets taken down into the Chamber of Secrets. Then, you can tell me to shove off. Until then, you will shut your mouth or you'll never open it again!"

Ron stood there, rooted to the spot and aghast at what Malfoy had just said. "Your... sister?" was all he could repeat.

The blond's eyes flashed. "Yes, Weasley, my sister! I know you don't give a damn, so how about you get your worthless hide out of my way!"

"Your... sister got taken?"

Draco's face twisted into something vile and Ron could see that he meant to throw a retort at him so hard that it would break him in two, but all that came out was a strangled choking sound as Malfoy buried his head in his hands and began to shake.

It took a moment for Ron to realize that Malfoy was crying. Openly crying right in front of him. Never in his life had he been so surprised to see anyone do anything. It was the absolute last thing he had expected. Ron found himself taken completely aback and with no idea what to do, but he finally began to process Malfoy's words.

His sister had been taken into the Chamber of Secrets and he was here. He wanted Ron to get out of the way. Merlin, he would be damned. Draco Malfoy was ready and willing to risk his own life to save his sister's.

Slowly and with great trepidation, Ron stepped forward and placed a hesitant hand on Malfoy's arm. Malfoy tensed, but did not pull away so Ron slowly guided him towards the sinks just as the boy appeared to regain control of himself and hastily wiped at his eyes with the arm Ron did not have a hold of.

"This is the sink that I think leads to the chamber," he explained.

"Th-this one?" Malfoy asked.

"Yeah," said Ron, pointing at the small, serpentine carving. "Can you see that?"

Draco leant forward and squinted. "A mark," he said in a low voice. "Slytherin must have left it there."

Ron nodded. "Trouble is, I have no idea what the hell to do with it."

"Lucky for you, Weasley," came another voice from the door, "I think I do."

Both boys turned and gawked at the exact same time.

"Potter?" asked Ron, who would have thought by now he was dreaming had his nose not throbbed so horribly.

"Sorry to intrude," Potter said with a small inclination of his head. "I didn't think I'd ever see the two of you working together. Congratulations, Draco; you might actually have grown up." The blond's face flushed with even more colour as Potter moved forward. "This sink you said, Weasley?" he asked. "The one with the carving that looks like a snake?"

Potter waited for a moment before turning, annoyed to see Ron gaping at him and taken too far aback to speak. These were the last two people who he would ever have expected to be going after the Heir of Slytherin.

The boy sighed before turning towards the sink and... hissing.

Ron gasped as his eyes widened, hardly even noticing the sink slide aside.

Not until it had opened fully did Ron speak. "You-you're a bloody Parselmouth!?"

Potter paused at the mouth of the grimy tube long enough to shoot a glance towards Ron over his shoulder. "Why so surprised, Weasley? You seemed pretty sure I was the Heir of Slytherin back in December."

With that, he was gone, leaving a gaping Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy to do little more than exchange glances and follow.

**Harry Potter and the Perversion of Purity**

**By ACI100**

**Book 2: The Erosion of Innocence**

**Chapter 27: The Striking of Snakes**

***May 16, 1993***

***Severus Snape's Office***

***12:23 AM***

The room dimmed around him for a moment as Severus Snape's eyes flickered. Exhaustion pulled at his eyelids but he fought it off. He would fend it off with Occlumency if that was what it took.

The letter had been sent to Dumbledore, but Merlin only knew where the old man was. He had said nothing before leaving and Snape had heard nothing since. The man felt half a world away and Snape had never needed him more than now.

He was not fit to lead a castle, least of all in times like these. He had always followed. Whether it had been the pureblood fanatics back at Hogwarts, the Dark Lord during the Purity War, or Dumbledore himself ever since Lily's life had become forfeit, Snape had never known what it meant to lead. Being thrown into the position now of all times felt especially cruel.

What was he to do? There were no clues about the Heir of Slytherin and even less about the monster. It must have crept through the castle silent as a shadow and struck swift as the hand of death, but that was all Snape could say he knew. It being a snake made a degree of sense, but he knew of no serpent that could so easily overpower the likes of Minerva McGonagall.

And now a double attack --- one involving Lucius Malfoy's daughter nonetheless. The man's wrath would rain down upon them like a hundred vengeful thunderbolts. The castle would be fortunate if it stayed open until the week's end. Malfoy would demand the aurors investigate what had before been kept within the confines of the castle. It would stir all manner of problems and Snape knew the aurors would be of no use.

How could one fight the unknown? The Dark Arts were like that, but they were different. They were like a hydra that showed two new heads every time one was cut down. Hydras were ancient, powerful, and unimaginably dangerous, but at least you could see them and the heads that needed to be destroyed. Battling a hundred hydras seemed easier than dealing with the Heir of Slytherin.

Snape might have fled if things were different. What did he care if the castle was closed? His livelihood, he supposed, but he'd never wanted the post and the years of service had not swayed him. The Potter boy was here; that was all that mattered. So long as the Dark Lord made moves within the castle, Lily's son was in mortal peril. That was what Snape was fighting. This mess had to end before the Dark Lord forced yet another confrontation with Potter. Lightning had struck not once, but twice; Severus would not gamble on a third instance.

Snape's fingers flexed. How he urged to draw his wand and end this whole charade. Even failure would be better than sitting idle whilst any number of things could be happening all around the castle.

For now, he was battling shadows and he wished only for guidance about how to move next. The shadows had crept further forward than he had expected, slithering forth like dark serpents with their tongues probing and their fangs bared.

Severus stiffened in his chair, if only for a moment. Something had moved outside his office. The halls should have been as still and silent as a cemetery, yet something had moved. He could feel it brushing against the wards that protected his office each night. The interim headmaster reached out with his Legilimency senses, but he could feel nothing.

The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end. That was even more ominous. Whoever was moving outside was a master Occlumens. That was troubling. Albus was gone and he knew of no other in the castle who could rebuff him with such ease. That could only mean one thing.

His wishes had been answered. The Heir of Slytherin had come and it was time to face them on the treacherous fields of battle.

Snape tried to stand but never made it to his feet. Pain erupted inside him. It was a red hot pain that shattered his focus, if only for a second. Not because of its brutality, but because of what it meant. Severus Snape had not felt pain like this in nearly twelve long years. Not since lightning had first struck, taking the Dark Lord away with its storm like a whisper of the wind. He knew this pain without looking, knew it without thinking.

His Dark Mark had burned --- truly burned --- for the first time since the Dark Lord's downfall and that could only mean one thing.

Dumbledore was right --- he really was coming back.

Snape grasped for his Occlumency and cleared his mind faster than any man could blink, but even that was too slow and too late.

The door to his office exploded inwards with the force of his assailant's spell. Snape felt his wand torn from him and a sensation of weightlessness come over him just as he realized what had happened.

The burning of the mark had been orchestrated --- likely little more than a distraction --- and he had fallen right into the ambush laid out for him.

***Somewhere beneath Hogwarts Castle...***

Harry knew the others had followed even as he plunged into the belly of the castle. Wind whipped at his robes and sent them billowing around him as he flew down the pipe. It was not unlike soaring through the air on his broomstick save for the grime that had coated him long before he reached the place where the sloping tube ended.

He threw his head to the side to pull his hair from his eyes and look out around him. There was nothing but the tube and darkness for as far as he could see. He wondered if this was how the prey of serpents must feel. The way the pipe twisted this way and that did make it look something like a coiled snake fast asleep. The idea of that coming at you from the darkness was not one Harry envied, though it was perhaps more favourable than what he was charging head-long into if Grindelwald was right.

***Earlier that night...***

"What is it?" Harry asked, hardly daring to believe that the ancient sorcerer had put the pieces together.

"A basilisk," said Grindelwald with no preamble.

"A what?" asked Harry.

"A basilisk," Grindelwald repeated. "They are massive serpents that can live hundreds or even thousands of years. Their scales are said to withstand all but the vilest magics and they can kill with their stare alone."

Harry's jaw nearly clattered to the floor, but something sparked inside his mind. "Hang on," he said, "kill? Nobody's died."

"Not this time, no, but I am aware that a girl was said to have died there fifty years ago when the Chamber of Secrets had allegedly been opened."

"How do you---"

"It was where Dumbledore dwelled. Do you think I was ignorant of what my most daunting foe was doing?"

Harry shook his head; that thought had not even crossed his mind. "But... how do you explain no one having died this time?"

"I have no need. You have done that for me already."

"I've... what?"

"All of the victims saw reflections of the monster's eyes. In pools of water, cameras, mirrors, or windows."

"So... if you see the stare through something, it doesn't kill you? Just petrifies you?"

"I don't think that hypothesis has ever been tested, but I think it is logical. Most people believe that basilisks have never existed at all."

"They... what?"

"Yes, an oversight made by many. They are the creatures of myths and legends. Those who speak of Herpo the Foul tell of how he once commanded a mighty basilisk that massacred cities for its master. There are other tales of them, but none pay them the heed they deserve." The man's eyes sparkled with an odd sort of light as his lips curved upwards into a condescending smirk. "People have a way of overlooking myths and legends. It cost them dearly against me and it has cost them once again. I doubt anyone even considered a basilisk. Albus ought to have, but he was never much for tales. Only the Hallows and only because he lived so close to the family in the story."

"So you think Dumbledore doesn't even know about basilisks?"

"I'm sure he's heard of them, but perhaps he has not read enough to realize they are more than the tales of legends. Who am I to say? It has been decades since I laid eyes upon my oldest friend. I can only guess at the man he has become."

"Oldest friend?" asked Harry. It could have been a barb, but somehow, that did not seem like Grindelwald's style.

"Think nothing of it for now," the man said. "If you must face this monster, you will do so armed with all I can give you."

***Back in the present...***

Harry could hear nothing but the whistling wind as he plunged deeper and deeper into the darkness. He had given up on keeping his hair out of his eyes by now. It tickled his forehead as he thought back on the vision he'd shared with Grindelwald.

The man hadn't had much to offer. A spell to conjure glass, one to impair the basilisk's eyes, and the knowledge that a rooster's cry would kill the monster. Harry had no time to fetch a rooster, so he would need to make do with glass, the Conjunctivitis Curse, and Parseltongue. It was the latter he planned to lean on, but Grindelwald need not know that.

Finally, Harry felt the chute level out and had only that as a warning before his feet slammed so hard against a rough rock floor that his knees buckled and he was sent sprawling. His hand stung like it had been stabbed by a dozen tiny needles and he did not realize why until he lifted his arm. Small pebbles had punctured the skin on his palm and round rivulets of blood welled up like the broken shards of shattered rubies.

Harry heard Draco coming long before he saw him. The youngest Malfoy had shown courage Harry hadn't known he possessed by following him down into the Chamber of Secrets, but that courage did not extend to plunging through empty darkness with quiet dignity.

He shot straight out of the tube in much the same manner Harry had a moment earlier. He too tumbled and was even sent rolling, but he appeared uninjured by the time he retook his feet.

Harry met his eyes for the first time that night and was surprised by what he saw. There was no regret or trepidation there; only cold, grey resolution with defiance flashing here and there like jagged streaks of lightning.

Harry contemplated saying something, but Weasley was barreling down the tube not far behind him and Harry knew there was no time to waste. His wand was in his hand a moment later and he was marching, Draco trailing in his wake and Weasley cursing in a hissing whisper not far behind them.

"Get him to shut up," Harry whispered and Draco fell back. He paused for a moment to let both boys catch up to him. They were both mercifully silent now. "The monster is a basilisk. The important thing is that if you look it in the eyes, you'll die. Best avoid doing that if you can manage."

He did not wait for a reply and noticed that both of their steps faltered for a moment whilst his pressed on. One after another they sounded dully against the ancient stone floor like the sound of falling rain drops in one of Hogwarts' many courtyards.

The tunnels were wide and high-ceilinged. However huge the snake was, Harry had no trouble imagining it slithering through these passages. They were clearly made for it and the fact only made Harry all the more wary. It was maddeningly dark, but Harry didn't dare light his wand. Anything that could draw the monster's attention was something to be avoided at all costs.

His resolve on that front was tested a moment later when he came upon something so massive it made him pause and shut his eyes. Harry waited there for Death's caress, but it never came and so he realized that what he had seen must not be the monster that dwelled somewhere within these halls.

"Bloody hell," Harry heard Weasley curse from behind him. "Look at the size of that thing!"

Harry did look, and his eyes widened in the dark. He heard something behind him and turned. It was Weasley fumbling for his wand. Why he hadn't had it out already, Harry could not imagine.

"Not now," he hissed.

Weasley's head snapped around to face him. "What---"

"I said not now! How thick are you, Weasley? Do you want us to send up a flare next?"

"I---"

"If you light your wand, whoever and whatever is down here can follow the light right to us."

Weasley had no response for that and Harry couldn't see his face, but he liked to imagine the boy was blushing with embarrassment. Harry turned back to the massive shadow. It was a skin; one that must have belonged to the basilisk at one time or another. It was impossibly long --- dozens of feet at least --- and its colour was a green so vivid that the skin itself looked poisonous.

"How the hell are we going to fight that?" Harry heard Draco ask from behind him.

"You're free to do whatever you like," Harry said over his shoulder, "but I have no plans of fighting it."

"Then how---"

"Parseltongue," Draco reminded Weasley with a slow and steady nod before looking back at Harry. "Do you think you can---"

"I have no idea. I won't know until I try. Now, let's go; quiet again."

It was odd to lead like this, but there was no one else to do it. Cassie was back up in the castle and Diana was down here somewhere, alone and perhaps even petrified in this infernal darkness. Harry was the best of what they had. He had not asked for help, but these two were here and Harry would not begrudge them that. Taking down the Heir of Slytherin was a task so daunting he would take all the help he could get.

They walked for some time before Harry realized that the tunnel was coming to an end. Their footsteps had sounded loud before in the otherwise silent void, but the sound had drifted up and been lost in the nothingness high above them. The longer they walked, the louder their footfalls became as something seemed to throw the noise back at them.

That something eventually loomed out at them from the blackness up ahead and Harry heard Draco take a sharp inhale as it came into sight.

It was a pair of heavy stone doors weathered by the centuries that had passed since their construction. There was a pair of elaborate and interwoven serpents carved on them. Their eyes glowed in the darkness and they seemed to watch Harry's every move.

The Boy-Who-Lived looked from Ron Weasley, to Draco Malfoy, and then back at what could only be the chamber's main entrance before he took a final deep breath and hissed.

"**Open!**"

The sound was much too loud. Anyone or anything inside the chamber would know they were coming, their arrival heralded by the rumbling of stone grinding against stone. It was like somebody trying to start a fire with a flint, but a hundred --- no, a thousand times louder.

The chamber was larger than Harry had ever imagined, though lacking in splendour. It was dominated by a countless number of stone pillars that stretched so high, they were lost in the canopy of darkness far above. Harry was sure that a ceiling was there, but it loomed so high that it was lost to sight. Torches flickered in brackets hung along the walls. The room was so vast that their shadows leapt around gleefully, revelling in their freedom as they played tricks on Harry's eyes.

"Blimey," Ron whispered from behind Harry. The raven-haired youth pulled his eyes away from the nearby architecture and immediately knew what Weasley meant.

There was a towering statue at the end of the hall. It rose almost to the ceiling, stretching up so far that its face was shrouded in shadow. What Harry could see was dark eyes, high cheekbones, and a long beard that fell most of the way to the floor.

A part of him expected Draco to take pleasure in the statue, but his former friend had seen something Harry had not and abandoned any pretence of stealth or silence.

"Diana!"

"Damn!" Harry cursed under his breath. If anyone was waiting for them and somehow hadn't heard the doors open, they had just lost any potential of an ambush.

Sure enough, Diana was there at the foot of the statue lying beside another, smaller figure who Harry could only assume was Luna Lovegood. Her hair was as pale as the Malfoy heiress's and her chest rose and fell with slow, rhythmic movements.

There was a third girl sprawled closer to the trio than Diana, her skin paler than milk. She looked dead to Harry and he would even have thought so had she too not visibly been breathing. Her breaths were different. There was nothing rhythmic about them. They were deep and rasping; Harry could hear the sounds of them even from afar.

"Diana, please!" Draco was pleading. "It's me, your brother, wake up! Diana, I'm here, just listen to me!"

"She won't wake," came a voice from the shadows that Harry had never heard before. His wand snapped up and took aim, but there was a moment's pause before anyone appeared.

The form of a boy shimmered into being just off to the right of where the three girls lay. He looked young --- no older than sixteen or seventeen. He was slim and very tall for his age with pale skin, dark blue eyes, and hair as black as Harry's own. There were three boys before him, but he seemed to have eyes only for Harry. Those dark, unnerving eyes sent a shiver up his spine as they seemed to dissect him.

"Who are you?" asked Weasley, his wand too raised.

The boy tilted his head to one side. "So the future students of Hogwarts don't know me by sight. Shame. I had hoped they would." The boy's eyes flicked to Ron for a moment, but they landed back on Harry just as fast. "I expected only one of you."

"What have you done with my sister!?" Draco stormed, rounding on the boy with murder in his eyes.

"Very little. She's alive and quite all right. As is her friend."

"What about the other girl?" Ron asked, gesturing to the figure who laid a ways apart from the others.

"She's... alive."

"What have you done to her?" Weasley asked furiously.

"That\'s an interesting question,\" said the boy. "It's quite a long story. I suppose the real reason she's like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger.\"

\"What are you talking about?\" asked Harry, suddenly distracted by this third girl. She looked familiar and he was wracking his brain trying to remember where he had seen her in the past.

\"The diary,\" the boy said with a gesture towards something Harry had not noticed. It appeared to be a plain black book. "My diary. She and her sister have been writing in it for months and months, telling me all their pitiful worries and woes."

'She and her sister...'

It clicked all at once. This was one of the dark-haired twins who had been sorted into Slytherin at the beginning of September. Carrow, her name was, but if they had both written in what Harry could only assume was some kind of cursed diary that had once belonged to Voldemort...

"Her sister won't be with us tonight, I'm afraid," the boy went on. "She has... other business to attend to."

***Back in Severus Snape's office...***

Snape struggled uselessly against invisible bindings that pinned him to the wall. His wand had clattered to the floor and he cursed himself then for never learning how to summon it without a wand. It had been an experiment he'd contemplated as a youth, but he had become too preoccupied by pursuing Lily and inventing new magic.

Snape wasn't sure what he expected to walk through his office door. The Dark Lord, perhaps, or one of his more talented underlings. He did not know, but he was certain of one thing: he had most definitely not expected the small, slight form of one of his very own first years.

"Carrow!" he snarled, fending off shock with Occlumency as he fixed the young girl with the most dignified glare he could muster. "What is the---" he felt his voice die in his throat with a lazy, dismissive wave of the girl's hand.

His eyes widened. Wandless magic from an eleven-year-old girl? Surely that was impossible. He had never known anyone so gifted; he doubted even Dumbledore or the Dark Lord had been so advanced at such a young age.

But it mattered not, for the girl did not remain wandless for long.

Hers was in her hand a moment later and pointed directly at Snape. Not at his chest, or throat, or face, but at his left arm of all things. He wondered what on earth she thought she was doing before his blood ran cold at her next words.

"FIDELIUS OCCULTUM!"

***Meanwhile, in the Chamber of Secrets...***

The boy paused and cocked his head to the side as though listening to some sound only he could hear. "Business that has now been taken care of," he said with a smile. "She will not be here regardless."

"I don't get it," said Draco, realizing by now there was nothing he could do for his sister until the new enemy was dead. "Who are you and why did the Carrow twins write in some cursed book? They ought to have more sense!"

"You would think so, wouldn't you?" asked the boy with a sharp smile that made Harry's skin crawl. "I\'ve always been able to charm the people I needed."

"But how did that lead to this?" asked Harry, who had never imagined magic of this kind.

"They poured their souls out to me, and their souls happened to be exactly what I wanted\... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of their deepest fears, their darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful than them. Powerful enough to start feeding them a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into them..."

\"What d\'you mean?\" asked Weasley, whose jaw had tightened with every word this menace uttered.

\"Haven\'t you guessed yet?" asked the boy with mockery filling his voice.

"It was the Carrows," Harry said quietly. "They were the ones who opened the Chamber of Secrets because he convinced them to."

"What?" sputtered Draco.

"The attack on McGonagall was set up by more than one student. We've known that for months. Now, we know why."

"How clever," said the boy with that same, twisted smile. "Perhaps the Boy-Who-Lived may live up to his lofty reputation."

"Who are you?" Weasley asked again. "I've never seen you at Hogwarts."

"That's because he isn't at Hogwarts," said Harry. There was the familiar serpent on his chest and beside it gleamed a shining silver badge that marked him as a prefect. Harry knew all of Slytherin's prefects and this boy was not one of them.

It explained a lot, actually. How Voldemort had been orchestrating everything this whole year, how the Carrows had been getting into the chamber despite not being Parselmouths, why this ghost of a boy was so blurry around the edges, almost like he was not entirely human.

"You know who I am." It was not a question the boy asked, but a statement as he met Harry's eyes directly.

Harry did not blink. "Your name is Tom Riddle, but you won't go by it forever. One day, you'll grow up to take a different name and murder my parents."

Draco staggered backwards with a hand on his chest as he gaped comically at the ghost-like figure. Weasley just stood there, dumbstruck and uncomprehending as he stared between Harry and Riddle, whose eyes gleamed.

"He's... *him*?" asked Weasley. "But... how?"

A malicious light danced in Riddle's eyes. "I see that some things went to plan. You may not know the name Tom Riddle, but I see that the moniker of Lord Voldemort has meaning even now. It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts."

Harry could see Draco glancing between him, his sister, and Riddle and almost cursed.

That was when he put it together.

*"Years ago, my father was accused of something horrible. Something he never actually did. He was proven innocent by the Wizengamot and everything. Longbottom's parents... they're not dead, but they're in no state to be his parents. They were attacked at the end of the last war, and they've been locked up in St. Mungo's --- the major wizarding hospital --- ever since. They're as good as comatose, so Longbottom has been raised by his grandmother and she's basically run their family ever since."*

Diana's words from so long ago floated back to Harry like the smell of a distant fire on a strong autumn breeze. Words spoken atop the balcony the two of them had so often found themselves lurking on... words that Harry intuitively now knew were lies.

There could be only one way Draco was hesitating to act despite his sister lying motionless at this monster's hands --- his father had once served a version of this man.

It explained everything.

Why the Malfoys had taken such an interest in him, why the Longbottoms and Weasleys despised them so much, and now this. This hesitation had Draco pinned to the spot.

Harry could not lose him now. The odds of three of them against Voldemort were not favourable no matter how old this version of the Dark Lord was. If Draco turned on Harry and Ron, it would squander the small chance they still had remaining.

There was little Harry could do to convince Draco he was better off putting faith in Harry than Voldemort. Harry could think of only one desperate plan, one born from an aimless thought he'd had often enough when thinking of the Dark Lord over the past two years.

"Why hide behind a mask? Why would the Heir of Slytherin take on a fake name? I don't get it."

"Don't you," hissed Riddle with venom in his voice. "There are some things about me that you don't yet know."

"Clearly."

"Let me explain it then. Do you think I was going to use my filthy muggle father\'s name forever?" Harry heard Draco's gasp from off to his side and could only pray he had taken from that comment what Harry hoped he had. "I," continued Riddle, "in whose veins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself through my mother\'s side? I keep the name of a foul, common muggle who abandoned me before I was born just because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry --- I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!\"

"What I don't understand is how you're here. You were a student fifty years ago."

"I was," Riddle admitted. "Fifty years... yes, I suppose that's right. For me, it feels like no time has passed at all."

"Are you a ghost?" asked Weasley, eyeing the odd blur around Riddle's body. Harry had heard of Weasley's skill at chess and he could believe it now. The way his eyes scanned Riddle up and down as though they were trying to spot any signs of weakness.

"A memory," said Riddle. "One that grows stronger as the Carrows grow weaker." For a moment, Harry swore Riddle's eyes had flashed scarlet. "Now that Flora's business up in the castle has concluded, she's joined her sister in pouring everything she has left into the diary. When they're done, I will be reborn again."

Harry's breath caught in his throat. Was this Voldemort's master plan? Resurrect a younger version of himself so that it could help him regain his power? It made some sense, Harry supposed. If Voldemort could add a clone of himself, it would be an immeasurable boon to his forces.

Harry was scared now. It was one of the first times he could ever remember being scared like this. He had felt dread at the Dursleys, but scarcely ever fear. The only time he could ever remember feeling this way was when he had landed inside Nurmengard Prison and looked upon the desecrated corpses that had once served as guards.

If Riddle was telling the truth, then they had no hope. They had to somehow stop the Carrows from pouring themselves into the diary, but how were they to do that? Harry hadn't the faintest idea how magic like this worked and there was no time now to communicate with Grindelwald and ask for help. If Riddle was reborn, the three of them would die in this chamber and Britain would be plunged into a war worse than even the last.

"You won't get away with this!" Weasley bellowed.

"Why ever not?" asked Riddle, his stare finally falling on Ron.

"Because Dumbledore will stop you if we don't."

Riddle's expression twisted into something ugly. "Dumbledore has been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me."

"He's not really gone," said Harry, taking a sudden bout of inspiration. "Not as long as people here are loyal to him."

They were foolish, childish words and he knew it, but he could think of nothing else that might throw Riddle off his game. Dumbledore had been called the only one Voldemort had ever feared. Harry hoped that was even truer of the boy than it had been of the man.

Music was suddenly coming from somewhere, cutting Riddle off just as he made to open his mouth. He whirled around to stare down the empty chamber but was greeted only by the towering pillars and dancing shadows.

The music was growing louder. It was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry\'s scalp and made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size. As the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar and a familiar-looking crimson bird the size of a swan was suddenly there, piping its ethereal music to the vaulted ceiling. It had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacock\'s and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged bundle.

The bird let out its loudest note yet and spread its wings. Suddenly, it was flying straight at Harry, Ron, and Draco. It dropped the ragged thing it was carrying as it flew over Ron before landing heavily on Harry's shoulder. Harry looked up and saw as it folded its wings that it had a long, golden beak and a beady black eye.

The bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to Harry\'s cheek, gazing steadily at Riddle.

"Fawkes?" Harry asked quietly as he stroked the bird's feathers. It gave a single nod but did not look away from Riddle. Behind him, Harry could hear that Weasley had retrieved whatever the phoenix had dropped.

"This is what Dumbledore sends his defenders!" Riddle mocked with glee in his eyes. "A songbird and an old hat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?\"

Harry just stared back at Riddle as his two companions tensed. All of them could tell that the fight was about to start. Harry thought it was for the better. Riddle was becoming less blurry the longer they spoke.

*"I grow stronger as the Carrows grow weaker"* he had said. Perhaps it was best to try and finish him before he grew too strong.

"I find myself with the opportunity to crush two myths in a single night," said Riddle, eyes gleaming. "Let\'s match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famed wisdom of Albus Dumbledore and the mysterious enigma that is Harry Potter." Riddle smiled that bone-chilling smile again. "Let us deal with the former first, shall we?"

Riddle's stare fell momentarily back on Harry and there was a rabid sort of hunger in his eyes. But then he whirled around to face the towering statue of Salazar Slytherin and spoke words that only Harry understood.

**"Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts four!"**

For the third time that night, Harry could hear the sound of stone grinding against stone as yet another entrance opened with the gaping of Slytherin's gigantic mouth. Harry could see the outline of something green and massive slithering about inside the founder's maw.

"Don't look at it!" Harry shouted as something immensely heavy fell against the floor. It spat and hissed, but Harry could not make out what it was saying over Riddle's singular command.

**"Leave the boy with the bird on his shoulder. Kill the others."**

"Run!" Harry shouted as the snake lunged towards Weasley and Draco. They both rolled out of the way with reflexes born of a seeker before bolting in opposite directions. The snake sputtered for a moment as it tried to decide which to kill first, but Harry could not focus on them. He had to hope they could stay alive while he did his best to deal with the Heir of Slytherin.

***Outside Hogwarts Castle...***

Dumbledore had known the time to return to Hogwarts had come when a flash of fire had illuminated his world and Fawkes had left him a single golden feather. He wished the phoenix could take him down into the Chamber of Secrets, but it would have been ill-advised to try. Fawkes could pass through any ward but ones as potentially hostile as Slytherin's might well do damage to those he took through.

Getting back onto the Hogwarts grounds without Fawkes had been simple and oddly satisfying. It had been a long time since Albus had gotten to use his deluminator. It was one of his most ingenious inventions, yet it seemed forever overlooked. A shame, really.

He appeared on the sloping front lawns in the centre of a pale halo of light. The shadowy outline of the castle appeared the brightest and most beautiful thing Albus had ever seen.

What he was going to do, he did not know, but it began with finding Severus and learning anything from the man he could. Elsewise... he would wait.

***Back in the Chamber of Secrets...***

Ron's chest heaved as he ran faster than he had ever run before. He could hear Malfoy scamper off in the other direction and hear the loud thuds as the basilisk pursued him. Better Malfoy than him, but it was only a temporary respite. The monster would kill him, then it would come for Ron and the youngest male Weasley had no idea what to do about any of it.

He was running so fast and irrationally that he nearly ploughed straight into the chamber's back wall. He stopped as fast as he could but wound up toppling to the floor and sliding ribs first into a pillar anyway. A sharp pain like that of a jagged blade stuck in his chest and tore the breath from his lungs. They ached with a flaming sort of pain, but there was nothing Ron could do about that.

For a moment, he thought he had fainted as he tried to fill his lungs again. Everything had suddenly grown dark. Then, he realized what he had been carrying and that it had fallen over his head.

*Help me,* he thought, desperately pleading with the Sorting Hat to offer any advice it had. *I don't know what to do! Please, help me!*

Something hit him so hard over the head that Ron thought the hat was scolding him. Lights danced before his eyes like miniature stars, but they began to fade quickly, leaving Ron in the darkness once again.

No... that was not right. It was no longer dark; whatever had hit him in the head had pushed the Sorting Hat off of him. Ron looked down through squinted eyes, afraid the snake had finished off Malfoy and had come to kill him next.

His eyes flew wide open with shock a second later when he saw a silver sword encrusted with rubies so splendid they looked fit for gods. There was a single name etched into the sword, one that Ron knew all too well. It was the only name Ron could think of that could have given him so much hope while all around him seemed so dire.

Slowly and with legs shaking like thin, spindly branches in the harsh winter winds, Ron clambered to his feet.

"To business, Harry," said Riddle. Harry looked calmly back at him and ignored everything else going on in the room only with the help of months and months of practice clearing his mind and keeping it that way. "We met in your past and in my future, yet you survived. How?"

Harry blinked dumbly. "What?"

"How is it that an infant with no extraordinary magical power vanquished the greatest sorcerer of all time? Tell me. The longer you talk, the longer you live."

Harry couldn't and he knew it. If this Riddle won the day and made it back to Voldemort, Harry could not have him knowing. Not when he was unsure if Voldemort himself even knew what had truly happened that night.

"What's it to you?" asked Harry. "Are you afraid you might not be able to kill me now?"

"I do not fear you, I am simply interested in you. We're similar, you know. Both halfbloods, both orphans raised by muggles unfit to lick the hems of our robes. We were both sorted into Slytherin House and quickly became prodigies. We're probably the only two Parselmouths who have come through this school since the great Salazar Slytherin himself and we even look somewhat alike. Can you blame me for being intrigued about you? I want a measure of what you could become before I take it all away."

Harry tensed. The moment was coming and he knew it. Once he refused to play Riddle's game, the time for talking would swiftly end.

"I don't fear you either, Riddle."

"You should."

"No, I don't think so. Not now. I've seen what you've become." Harry watched him through bright, emerald eyes. "Do you know that Samhain 1981 wasn't the only time we've crossed paths?" That hungry gleam was back in Riddle's eyes and it spoke the answer louder than the boy himself ever could. "I saw you last year --- I know what you've become."

"What I have become?"

"A parasite," spat Harry. "A bitter spirit leeching off stronger men to stay alive. You're pathetic, you're broken, and I beat you again. So no, Tom Riddle, I do not fear you."

Harry knew the spell was coming; he could feel it building on the tip of the wand Riddle held in his hand. Harry saw his arm lift and prepared to dodge out of the way, but the phoenix spread its wings and took flight before Harry could so much as move.

"AVADA KEDAVRA!"

It was an incantation Harry had never heard, but it sent tremors up his spine. Something about it sounded different and the air around the jet of green light that lunged from Riddle's wand like a hunting serpent seemed to cringe away as the vile magic hissed through the air.

Harry would not have been fast enough to dodge. He had never seen a spell move so fast, but the phoenix was there, interposed between Harry and Riddle and directly in the path of the sickening green light.

There was a flash of the same colour so bright that the chamber faded to nothing for a moment before returning. Harry heard a horrible squawk, but he paid it no heed. Fawkes was a phoenix. He could not be killed no matter what Riddle had just hit him with. He had bought Harry the time he needed; that was all that mattered.

"Ossio Fracto!"

It was the first spell that came to Harry's mind when he tried to think of something powerful and dangerous. It was one Grindelwald had used against an older boy who had once ambushed him in one of Durmstrang's many dark corridors.

He was almost surprised when the bolt of red light leapt from his wand. It was a powerful bit of magic and not a simple spell from what Harry knew. He had never even tried casting it before now, but the spell had come easier to him than many of the charms and transfigurations he had worked on this year.

Riddle made no move to defend himself as the Bone-Breaker came near and Harry realized why a second before the spell sailed straight through his opponent. Riddle was still 'a memory'. There were not yet any bones to speak of. How he could hold a wand, Harry did not know, but he supposed he had other, more troubling things to worry about.

"This is your final chance. Speak the truth! I will have it from you before you die!"

"Lacero!" Harry started his spells with the dark Cutting Curse before following it up with a Stunner, Disarming Charm, and another Lacero. They were all strung together in the way Cassie had been teaching him. Spell chaining had been one of the more difficult things he had learned so far, but it made a noticeable difference in how fast he could cast.

Yet it mattered not. Riddle allowed the Cutting Curses to pass through him as he batted away the other two before sending back a volley of his own. Harry had never seen at least half of the spells and the speed with which Riddle cast left him in awe.

"Imperio!"

"Protego!" Harry called, cornered against a pillar and unable to move.

It was like his shield had never been there. There was no indication it had even collapsed; it was like the magic had moved right through it.

Not that he had time to ponder it. Why would he ponder anything when he felt so blissfully light and free? It was like nothing existed and he was floating down a noiseless river that never ended. He thought how nice it would be to just close his eyes and drift away to sleep, but a voice from far away demanded his attention before he could.

"Tell me how you survived the Killing Curse?"

Harry felt his mouth open to answer, remembering the explanation Dumbledore had given him last June, but the words stuck in his throat.

Why would he give something so important away? That made no sense and besides, he was much more comfortable this way. Why would he trouble himself answering questions when all felt so warm and peaceful?

"Tell me!"

The voice was louder this time, as if the person it belonged to had taken several steps closer. This time, Harry's mouth didn't open and something nudged at the corner of his mind. Something... less pleasant than how he felt right now, yet insistent. Something that deserved his attention far more than this troublesome voice that wouldn't leave him alone.

"I said tell me!"

"NO!"

The spell was broken with that single word and Harry collapsed to his knees. His legs felt like lead and his lungs like they had been smashed in. His chest heaved with deep, rattling breaths as though he had just run a hundred miles. His hair was damp with the moisture of sweat and several long strands of it were sticking to his forehead.

Riddle looked less angry than he had a moment ago, but Harry found this version of him far more intimidating. "No?" he asked softly. "Harry, people do not tell Lord Voldemort no."

"Shove off!" Harry gasped, pushing himself roughly back to his feet. His legs wobbled beneath him and his body swayed as he placed a hand on a pillar for balance. It was like fighting off that last spell had taken everything he had.

Riddle's eyes flashed scarlet again and this time, Harry was sure he had seen correctly. "That is no way to speak to your lord, Harry. You must be punished for such offences." Harry tried to raise his wand and defend himself, but he knew he would be too slow.

"Crucio!"

It was pain unlike anything Harry had ever known. The room faded away once more, but this time, it was not replaced by bliss, but by jagged spikes, roaring fires, and unimaginable pain. His scar had been nothing to this. Not even the agony he'd felt whilst destroying Quirrell's body held a candle to this. This was monstrous, it was evil, and Harry wanted so badly for it to end. He would do anything for it to end; he hoped it killed him so he could be done with it and move on.

Air returned to Harry's lungs with the sudden sharpness of a well-timed sword thrust. It felt like one, too. His entire body felt like it had been subjected to one brutal stab after another.

He waited for Riddle to say something, anything, but he did not. Slowly, he opened his eyes and could hardly believe what he saw.

***Minutes earlier...***

The sword felt perfect in Ron's hands. It was not too heavy despite its size and length, nor was it too light.

It was perfect.

Ron was jolted by a horrible crashing sound as one of the pillars further up the chamber gave way. Malfoy was running back towards Potter and Riddle. It wasn't like he had much choice in the matter. The snake was leading him back that way, probably hoping to corner him against the statue of its one-time master.

The sword suddenly did feel just a touch heavy in Ron's hands as he realized what he had to do.

*"He chose to do what was right instead of what was easy and for that, he will be fondly remembered by all."*

Those words had stayed with Ron for almost a year now. They had been part of the ringing endorsement Dumbledore had bestowed upon Neville and his courage, and Ron knew there was truth to them. He had known long before Neville had met his end, known since he was old enough to be told what had happened to his uncles, Gideon and Fabian Prewitt.

There was honour in death defending what was right, but there was no valour in standing aside and watching others die --- whether you liked them or not.

Ron squinted and prepared to close his eyes at any moment as he charged towards the basilisk, sword in hand. It must have heard him coming because it turned. Ron slammed his eyes shut and leapt forward, thrusting his sword as he did. It passed through thin air as he leapt, but it stuck in something when he fell crashing back to the ground.

Ron knew something horrible had happened. The sword had not slammed harmlessly against stone. Its end had stuck in something and Ron had felt whatever it cut through give way under its edge. His hands trembled as he finally dared to look.

It was worse than he could ever have imagined.

The sword's end was buried in the chest of a small girl with blonde hair and silver eyes who had looked so very innocent sleeping at Salazar Slytherin's feet. Blood spread out from the gaping wound Gryffindor's sword had opened. It pooled, seeped through her robes and stained the floor around her. Its scent spread like poison; a coppery scene that made Ron nauseous.

Something slammed hard against his side and Ron lurched to his right just as something much larger slammed head first into the chamber floor. The basilisk had lunged at him as he knelt over the young girl he'd just murdered, but Draco Malfoy had knocked him out of the way. Draco Malfoy, of all people, had rescued him.

Ron glanced briefly at Malfoy, but he was already on his feet and moving away from the basilisk. Ron had no idea where he was going, but there was no time to consider it. The snake had slammed its fang so hard into the floor that it had stuck, but it was pulling itself free.

It was now or never.

Ron lunged forward and grabbed the sword before shutting his eyes tight and whirling to face the great snake, bringing the sword up and down as hard as he could. His battle cry reverberated off the chamber walls like the sounds of stones tumbling down a silent mountain in the midst of an almighty avalanche.

There was another sound, then. A horrible, high-pitched cry from the monster who Ron had just stabbed. He let go of the sword and leapt backwards out of the way. He knew without looking that the snake was dead; he heard its body slump loudly against the chamber floor.

So why was there still screaming?

"Weasley!" Ron opened his eyes without thinking and almost slammed them shut again before remembering what had just happened. "Weasley!" Malfoy called again and Ron looked at him. He was standing some distance away with something small in his hands. It took Ron a moment to realize that it was Tom Riddle's diary; the one the Carrows were pouring themselves into even as they spoke.

"What---"

"The sword, Weasley! Give me the sword!"

It took Ron a moment to realize what the other boy was thinking, but then it dawned on him.

*"I grow stronger as the Carrows grow weaker."*

"Catch!" called Ron, throwing Godric Gryffindor's fabled sword with all the might he could muster. Draco stepped to the side and reached up, catching its handle with all the grace of a seeker before driving its point --- still dripping with poison from the fang it had punctured --- straight through the cursed book that had caused all at Hogwarts so much hardship that year.

The screaming behind them stopped... only to be replaced by a single, more horrible wail so loud and powerful that it threw both Ron and Draco to the floor.

**Author's Endnote:**

**I contemplated splitting up this chapter. It is the longest in book 2 by a meaningful number of words, but I decided it was fitting for this arc's climax.**

**I can already see the reviews telling me that Harry didn't do enough in this battle. I will lay out my reasoning here and then those reviews will go largely ignored:**

**The basilisk was never going to be beaten by anything other than Gryffindor's sword and Harry in this story could never have pulled it from the hat. He was never going to outduel Riddle and though some will say he should have been the one to destroy the diary, you will all soon see that it does *so much* more for Draco's character than it could ever have done for Harry's.**

**It was also *extremely* important for Harry to feel like he'd lost this battle for reasons that will be obvious soon enough.**

***The Chamber of Secrets***

***1:24 AM***

Harry's mind was still weighed down by the haze of confusion and pain that clung to him like malicious drops of sweat. His chest rose and fell with great difficulty. Every breath he took sounded every bit as hoarse and rasping as Carrow's from earlier in the evening. Lifting his head seemed next to impossible. It was like somebody had draped a chain around Harry's neck with a boulder on the end in place of a pendant. Everything was on fire. Every time he tried to move, his entire body shook and spasmed. It was unlike anything he had ever felt before. When the first spell had been lifted, all it had left behind was a heavy sense of exhaustion. This left traces far harder to cope with in its wake and Harry wondered if he would even be able to stand.

Something made a sound from near Harry's right hand. It took a titanic effort for him to tilt his head and look. It was Fawkes. Where a great phoenix had perched upon his shoulder, a small, featherless bird now nudged something towards Harry's palm. It was his wand; he must have dropped it while under the effects of Riddle's final spell.

"Thanks, Fawkes," Harry mumbled, just barely managing to close his fingers around the holly wand. Just holding it sent a surge of warmth and energy through his body. It was far from enough to clamber to his feet, but he did finally manage to lift his head and survey the room around him.

It was complete and total bedlam.

Several of the pillars had broken apart, their rocky contents strewn all about the floor. Harry was sure the ceiling would have collapsed on all of them had some form of magic not held it up. Something massive lay upon the floor near Slytherin's feet. Its head was pressed against the floor, but Harry didn't need to see it to realize it was the basilisk. Nothing else in this room could be so hulking. He wondered how his companions had killed it, for it must be dead to lay so still and quiet.

The snake was not the only thing gathered around the statue of the Hogwarts founder.

All in the room but Harry seemed to be there. There was Carrow not far away, the snake, curled and shrunken by death, and Draco kneeling over Diana, who laid face up in a bed of blood.

That made Harry's heart stop. Had something happened to Diana? Had she been hurt during the battle? Was she... no, she had to be alive! That was a thought Harry wouldn't even think.

Then, he saw Ron Weasley and suddenly, he understood.

The boy was knelt over a blonde much like Draco, but his eyes were on Luna Lovegood and not the Malfoy Heiress. Harry knew why as soon as his eyes found them.

Harry couldn't see the girl well from his vantage point with Weasley in the way, but he could see the streaks of blood coiling out from the girl like an opening fist with crimson fingers. The smell hung thick and heavy in the air. Harry was surprised he hadn't noticed before, but he supposed he had been preoccupied by exhaustion and agony.

Harry tried to blink the black spots from his eyes, but his vision only swam with more of them the harder he tried. The room began to move all around him. The flaming torches were suddenly an orange blur that was spinning faster and faster until he wondered if his vision was just tinged orange because it seemed to be everywhere. He could feel his body shaking once more and thought the floor felt colder somehow as exhaustion tugged harder than ever at his weary eyelids.

Everything went black.

***Some time later...***

The dream began in the body of another, though Harry would not come to realize that until some time later.

He was in the same dark drawing room in which he'd held court during the last meeting of the few followers he had left.

"You have something urgent to report, Lucius?" His voice was almost human now. Only the hint of a rasping hiss not quite fit for a man lingered. It was a good sign. It meant that things were moving along at an appropriate pace and that his shell would be ready to shed itself soon.

"Yes, my lord."

"Then report," Harry said in that high, cold voice of his.

"The plan was successful, my lord. The distraction was successful and our target was taken care of."

There was such trepidation about the man; he was nervous. Harry would not have expected such reluctance to speak from a man who appeared to be delivering such glowing news.

"What else, Lucius?"

"M-My lord?"

"I said what else? You are nervous. What is it you fear telling me?"

Harry could see the way the man chewed his lip. It would be very unpleasant news indeed. "We... lost communication soon after the job had been done, my lord."

Harry felt anger and worry flash behind his eyes, but he quelled them both just as fast as they had come. "And what of the book?" he asked.

"I don't know, my lord."

"You will find out. You will go to the castle and you will learn of what has happened. You will do this immediately."

"Yes, my lord."

"Go!"

Lucius stood from the table and swept towards the room's exit. Harry could feel how relieved he was to be free of him for now. His anger must have leaked through, for the others in the room appeared just as worried.

"Leave me," said Harry. "I require time alone."

They all fled and were gone in an instant, all but the tall woman with blonde hair and blue eyes who had been his keeper over these months. She looked much like her daughter. It was easy for Harry to imagine Diana when looking at her... so easy that the dream changed.

Harry felt different now. He was taller, for one thing, and his mind felt more... familiar. He must have woken --- he was back in the Chamber of Secrets. Dust still rose from the places the pillars had collapsed, mixing its smell with that of blood and the already rotting corpse of the basilisk.

What was odd was that Weasley and Draco seemed to have left him. He was all alone kneeling over Diana. A jagged fang stuck in her chest and Harry pulled, feebly trying to free it from her. His hands still shook from the exhaustion and every muscle burned with the effort it took to pull upon the sword. All he was doing was painting the floor around her a deep crimson. Her eyes were open in the dream like they had not been in life and there was pain and anguish within them.

Harry realized it would be no good and allowed numb fingers to relinquish their grip upon the fang. He slumped beside Diana as tears stung the corners of his eyes. He reached out for her hand and took it. It was not yet cold, but her feeble grip betrayed how little time she had left.

"No," Harry begged. "Diana, please! You're going to be okay, just stay with me!"

Blood trickled from Diana's mouth when she tried to speak. She coughed and sputtered just as the light behind her eyes went out, leaving Harry to stare agonizingly at his own reflection... or the reflection that should have been his.

His cheekbones were higher than they ought to have been and his eyes were a deep, pupil-less scarlet instead of a bright and vivid green. The reflection opened his mouth and from his mouth too trickled a thin stream of blood, but a voice followed it. Not Harry's voice; it was colder yet smoother and it sent shivers up his spine.

*We're similar, you know. Both halfbloods, both orphans raised by muggles unfit to lick the hems of our robes. We were both sorted into Slytherin House and quickly became prodigies in our own right. We're probably the only two Parselmouths who have come through this school since the great Salazar Slytherin himself and we even look alike."*

This time, Harry was sure he had awoken. There was no Diana, no dark room he had never visited in life, and no haunting imagery that tore his heart to shreds. There was nothing but the soft bed beneath him, the warm covers on top of him, and aching pain that came from everywhere.

Harry heard a sigh from beside his bed and looked over. It was jarring to see Draco's father there so soon after he had seen him in his dream. Harry knew what it meant by now, but how was it Lucius had gotten here so fast? Had that much time truly passed?

"Good gracious, you're awake," the man said. "Thank Merlin for that. You must stop scaring us like this, Harry."

Harry could see the man looked stressed even in his current state. There was a weariness behind his eyes that usually chose other places to dwell. His hair was as immaculate as ever, but there was a slight flush in his cheeks.

"Sorry, sir. I don't exactly like ending up here either."

"No," said Lord Malfoy, "I suppose you don't."

"What time is it, sir? How long have I been out this time?"

"Not terribly long compared to the last. It's almost 5:00, you\'ve hardly been asleep for three hours."

That explained why Harry still felt exhausted and why his muscles felt so heavy. Or perhaps that was still part of whatever effects lingered from the curse he had been hit with.

"Did Madam Pomfrey diagnose anything?" Harry asked carefully.

"She looked you over, but it was the headmaster who passed the diagnosis."

Harry almost asked after Dumbledore before remembering the man meant Snape. "And what did he think?"

"He thought nothing; it was obvious that you had been tortured."

That lined up, yes. A torture curse was an apt description of whatever Riddle had used. "Can you tell me what spell I got hit with?" Harry asked in a quieter voice. "I'd never seen it before."

"I would certainly hope not." There was a sharpness in Lord Malfoy's words that Harry had never heard before. Harry did his best to look hopeful and the man sighed, casting his eyes about the hospital wing to ensure they were alone. "The Cruciatus Curse," he said after a moment. "It's a torture curse so heinous that the use of it on any fellow human being means a one-way trip to Azkaban with no hope of release."

"What about the curse before that?" Harry questioned. "Did Madam Pomfrey find anything from it?" The man shook his head. "It was... different," Harry explained. "It felt like I was far away and like nothing could go wrong. The voice... I wanted to listen. It was---\"

"Merlin's beard, boy," hissed Lord Malfoy. "Who in the hell was using Unforgivable Curses so liberally?"

Unforgivable Curses was a phrase Harry had never heard before, but it gave him something to work with --- something to research since Lord Malfoy seemed hesitant to speak of them. He supposed they must be some sort of list of spells that were punished in a similar fashion to this Cruciatus Curse.

"No one to worry about." His words were ominous and he knew that Draco's father would misunderstand him, but they were the only words he could force himself to speak.

"Harry," the man said, leaning closer, "if you tell me, I will be sure this man never steps foot outside of Azkaban Prison ever again. I can---"

"Why are you so eager to help me while you're working for *him*?"

The words had escaped him in a tumble of pent-up fury and confusion. Months of stress and worry had culminated all at once now that Harry's worst fears had been confirmed.

Lucius went as still as a statue, but Harry pressed on. "Why would you help the---"

"Silence!" hissed Malfoy, sliding his wand from his sleeve. Harry thought the man would curse him for a moment, but he only cast some sort of privacy spell around the room before hiding his wand once more and glaring at Harry for the first time the boy could remember. "Have you no sense? Never speak of such things in places like this!"

"I want an answer," said Harry, his eyes burning like emerald fire. "Why would you help me when you're working for Voldemort---"

"Don't speak his name!" Lord Malfoy snarled. Harry could see it had unnerved him, but he didn't care. This had been building and building for months.

*"The Malfoys might view you as a tool, but that doesn't mean all of us do."*

"Fear of the name increases fear of the thing itself. Your master doesn't scare me."

"You understand nothing. You know nothing of what he was like and what he made---"

"I know you supported him willingly --- and you still do."

"The Dark Lord is---"

"Alive and getting stronger. You've met with him. You're here at Hogwarts for him. He wanted you to check on something --- some kind of loss of communication."

The widening of Malfoy's eyes showed Harry at once that he was right and the dreams really were passages into Voldemort's mind.

"I see that you cannot be reasoned with in your current state of mind," the man said as he stood to his feet with a slightly shaky stance. "I will leave you with two things. The first is that I have officially won the case to transfer guardianship of you from those vile creatures to Lord Black."

Harry's heart soared. Anything was better than returning to the Dursleys. Even if Regulus was a Death Eater like Lucius... well, that would be more complicated, actually...

"The second," Malfoy continued, "is that the Dark Lord does not want you to fear him. He does not want you as an enemy. You don't need to fight him to survive; he is more than happy to let you prosper as long as you like."

This revelation made Harry's heart stop.

He was lying, surely.

Why would Voldemort want him to prosper after all Harry had done? After he had vanquished him not once, but twice. Especially now that he had opposed his plans for a third time.

No, Lucius Malfoy had to be lying. It was the only thing that made sense.

***Meanwhile, in the dungeons...***

Ron had spent what felt like forever in Snape's dungeon classroom. There had been a crowd waiting for them by the time they had gotten there.

***About three hours earlier...***

"Professor Dumbledore!" Ron cried the second he saw the man pacing back and forth across Snape's office.

The old man's head whipped around at the sound. His piercing blue eyes went first to Harry, who was being levitated behind them with Diana and the Carrow girl. Getting them up out of the pipe had been an absolute nightmare. Ron and Draco had needed to alternate between levitating and climbing out themselves. It had been one of the hardest things Ron had ever done. Luna had been left down there. They would need to have Potter help retrieve her body; there had just been no way they were going to manage getting anyone else back out of the chamber.

"What are their conditions?" Dumbledore asked, allowing his eyes to move on from Harry and roam over Malfoy and Carrow. Ron thought his gaze moved on rather reluctantly.

Draco Malfoy was being pulled aside by his father, so it was up to Ron to answer. "I don't know, sir. Carrow... she's probably in rough shape. Potter and Malfoy... I don't know."

"We must see them to the hospital wing. Severus, can you---"

"I'm taking Harry and my daughter," said Lucius Malfoy. "I can take the Carrow girl with us if you wish."

"Thank you, Lucius, I would be most appreciative."

"Think nothing of it, Dumbledore. Come, Draco, we can talk while walking."

"If I may impose---"

"No, Dumbledore, you may not. My son has had a long and trying night. I will be taking him home with me."

Dumbledore glanced from Snape to Malfoy, but neither of them flinched. "Very well, Lucius," he said. "I am in no position to stop you."

"No, you aren't," said Malfoy with what Ron thought was a very calculating look. "I think you'll find that you might again find yourself in one if you're more agreeable outside of the castle."

Dumbledore's expression darkened. Ron had not seen him look like that since he had explained Neville's death in the final chamber beneath the castle last June. "You would hold a child's safety hostage, Lucius?"

"I would do no such thing. He would be happier with my proposal and you know it. He asked me for it himself. Would you block a child's wishes after having him be mistreated for so many years?" The man's eyes had flashed with something that looked like lightning in their stormy depths. "Do not vilify me, Dumbledore. We both know I'm in the right this time."

The two men stared at each other for long moments as Ron tried to puzzle together what the hell they were on about. "I will cease my opposition to your proposal. I will be speaking with him," Dumbledore warned. "If he raises any objections, I will renew my efforts with vigour the likes of which you have never known."

Malfoy dipped his head. "A pleasure, Dumbledore. Naturally, I will do my part to make life easier for you in return."

"Good night, Lucius."

Suddenly, Ron found himself left alone with Dumbledore and Snape. "Now, Master Weasley," said Dumbledore, "I ask you once again to explain to me what has happened after another display of valour at the end of another trying year."

***Back in the present...***

So, Ron had told them. He'd been numb when he'd started the tale, but the shocked sense of apathy began to wane as he went on and on. The closer he came to the part about Luna, the harder it became to speak. It was like every word tore so violently at his throat that it had swollen shut by the time that part of the story had come around.

He had looked from Dumbledore to Snape and the guilt had consumed him. It was more physically painful than anything he had ever gone through before. The aftereffects of the Cruciatus Curse had nothing on this sort of pain. It was like a rabid pack of dogs had been trapped in his stomach and told the only way they would get food was to tear their way out.

How could he tell Dumbledore this? Snape would despise him even more, but Ron didn't care what the old bat thought. But Dumbledore... his parents... everyone.

Quidditch and his bravery last year were the only two ways he had ever been different from any of his brothers. Being overshadowed by so many was painful, but this? The guilt he felt for his mistake was monstrous, but others' reactions would be even worse. He would go from the unimportant Weasley to the horrible one overnight.

No... Ron couldn't do it. He could not force himself to tell Snape and Dumbledore what had happened, so he hadn't; only that Luna had been killed by the snake.

Keeping his emotions under check had been the most difficult thing Ron had ever done, but he had somehow avoided breaking down long enough to escape the confines of Snape's office and find a nearby abandoned classroom.

Only then did his knees give out and only then did the floodgates open.

The pain in his stomach had become too much and he heaved and heaved until a small pile of vomit covered the floor in front of him. Its smell wafted through the empty classroom and tears followed. Ron found he could not stop them. They fell and fell like a salted waterfall and Ron's face soon stung with them. His throat quivered each time his body sobbed and Ron wondered if it would ever end.

It did, but only when sleep took him some time later.

***That night, in the Headmaster's Office...***

That day at Hogwarts had been a very odd one. Everybody knew something had happened, but no one was quite sure what. Most did guess correctly once it was announced at dinner that Dumbledore would reassume his position as the castle's headmaster, but there were many questions.

Harry felt miserable. There was actually much to be happy with, but it was difficult when he could hardly move. Sitting up felt as taxing as climbing a mountain and as painful as getting run over by Uncle Vernon's company car. The pain was ebbing as the day aged, but it lingered. Whatever the Cruciatus Curse was, Harry vowed never to be hit with it again.

Not until the sun sank low in the sky and cast long shadows across the hospital wing's floor did Madam Pomfrey give Harry her leave.

"But hurry right back as soon as you're finished," she ordered. "Honestly, I don't know what Dumbledore's thinking asking for you. If it was anyone else---"

"Thank you, Madam Pomfrey," Harry said with a laboured wave. "I'll make sure to be back."

Never had he been so thankful to escape the hospital wing, but he quickly realized Madam Pomfrey had a point. Under his invisibility cloak, no one troubled him, but it did not make climbing the sets of stairs any easier. Harry had never been so grateful for the ones leading up to Dumbledore's office. They at least had the courtesy to carry him up.

"Ah, Harry," said Dumbledore once the youth had stepped inside his office, "how good to see you again. Please, take a seat."

Dumbledore looked tired. One would think nothing had been resolved by looking at him. "It's good to see you again too, sir."

"I am happy we now meet with the year's primary trouble behind us."

"So am I."

"How are you feeling? I understand you went through quite the ordeal."

"Not great," Harry admitted. "Getting up here wasn't easy, but Madam Pomfrey said it would pass."

"I apologize deeply for requesting your presence, but this is of the utmost importance."

"I know, sir, it's okay."

"You know what I must ask of you?"

"You want to know what happened?"

"I do. Young Ronald shed some light on things from his perspective, but you were noticeably absent from the tail end of his recollection."

"Everything sort of split up once we got to the Chamber of Secrets."

"A wise course of action," Dumbledore praised. "It was your only hope. What the three of you achieved was nothing short of spectacular. Now, what can you tell me that I might not know?"

Harry told him everything from the moment he'd heard the voice in the dungeon all the way up until Riddle had been vanquished. The only part he left out was that he had heard the voice of the basilisk earlier in the year. It was best not to explain why he had withheld that information until now. Especially when Harry was reasonably sure that the magic of Grindelwald's pendant would stop him if he tried.

"So," said Dumbledore once Harry had finished, "you met Tom Riddle."

"I did."

"I imagine he was *most* interested in you."

"He was."

It was difficult for Harry to speak about Riddle after last night's dream. The teenaged dark lord had only furthered the fears that Harry had been having for months. He knew now that Grindelwald's visions were not changing his mind, but he worried this year had taken its toll on him with its challenges and its betrayals.

"What is it he said that bothers you?" Dumbledore asked. Harry despised his perceptiveness as much as he did his boldness at times.

He considered avoiding the question, but something gave him pause. If anyone knew whether there was any truth to what Riddle said, it would be Dumbledore. "He said that we were similar."

"Did he now?"

"Both halfbloods, both orphans sorted into Slytherin, both gifted with magic, both Parselmouths --- he said we even look alike."

"And what do you think?"

Harry hesitated. "I... don't know."

Dumbledore's expression was passive. "Don't you?"

"Well... all of those things are true, aren't they? And... I just don't know. I... wouldn't be surprised."

"There is no shame in being like Tom Riddle," said Dumbledore. "Do notice the distinction."

"You used his old name."

"I did. Tom Riddle was just a boy as he said. His father was a wealthy muggle who abandoned his pureblooded mother when he realized she was a witch. His mother's family saw her as a disgrace and were never going to welcome her back. She sold off all her possessions to stay alive just long enough to give birth to her son in a London orphanage on a cold winter's day."

"His father---"

"Never came for him. I'm unsure whether he ever knew he had a son. If he did, he never asked after him."

Harry felt rage boil up in the pit of his stomach. Of course he hadn't; he was just a muggle. What did they care about witches and wizards, blood or not? They would sooner see them struggle and fail than support them whether they were family or not. It disgusted him. He couldn't believe that he was offended on Voldemort's behalf, but in that moment, Harry would have wrapped his hands around his father's neck and squeezed until the blood left his face.

"You look troubled," Dumbledore observed.

"I don't like the idea of *any* witch or wizard being abandoned to a muggle orphanage."

Harry saw something flash in Dumbledore's eyes, but it was gone in an instant. "No," he said softly, "I imagine you don't."

"What happened to his father?" Harry asked.

"Murdered," Dumbledore answered with a sigh, "by Riddle himself, I suspect."

Harry felt something spread wings and soar in his stomach. *Good,* he thought. For all the horrible things Voldemort had done, Harry could not say he blamed this one act of evil. If there was any act so heinous that he could forgive, this was it.

"So, Riddle and I had similar upbringings?"

"You did, though you never resorted to the lows that he did as a child."

"What did he do, sir?"

"A story for another time, I think." Dumbledore watched Harry closely. "There are strange likenesses between you and Tom Riddle. I will not lie to you, Harry, you deserve more than that. What sets you apart is your nature. Tom Riddle was a brilliant boy tormented in his youth. His vice was vengeance and his armour was hate. That weighed on him over the years until there was very little of Tom Riddle left and all that remained was the monster we know as Lord Voldemort. See that you walk a different path and there is nothing wrong with sharing likenesses to the most brilliant student who has ever walked these hallowed halls."

Harry nodded very slowly. "Thank you, Headmaster."

"I do have one more thing to trouble you with before I give you something that I think you want."

"Something that I want, sir?"

"Something you think you want. First, I must ask you whether or not you made requests of Lucius Malfoy pertaining to your legal guardianship."

A year ago, Harry would have cringed and looked away. Six months ago, Harry would have shrank back and panicked. Two weeks ago, Harry thought he would have lied.

He did none of those things now. He met Dumbledore's stare with passion. "Yes, sir."

"And you are aware who your guardianship is set to pass to?"

"Lord Black, yes."

"And you are satisfied with the arrangement?"

Satisfied was the word. It was difficult to say Harry was happy with the arrangement, but satisfied... he thought so. Regulus Black might well be a Death Eater, but Harry thought that was better than living with the Dursleys. He didn't think there was any witch or wizard less desirable than those vile creatures.

*"The second is that the Dark Lord does not want you to fear him. He does not want you as an enemy. You don't need to fight him to survive; he is more than happy to let you prosper as long as you like."*

Harry tried not to ponder Lord Malfoy's words, but the smallest bit of him wondered. Voldemort had seemed willing to spare him last year and Grindelwald had freed him from the Dursleys and saved his life. Harry was no fool. He knew that Grindelwald was using him and he was sure Voldemort would be no different, but... was that the worst thing?

Harry had accepted that the Malfoys were using him and chose to move on, and look where it had got him. Free of the Dursleys and with a life more prosperous than Harry could ever have imagined on Privet Drive. Grindelwald was using him but the more Harry played the dark lord's game, the more he won. It was a treacherous path that Harry walked with great caution and he would rather Voldemort not be on it at all, but if he was... maybe, just maybe...

"I am."

"I will respect your wishes, but please, promise me you will be careful around Lord Black. His family has many skeletons in its vast and messy closet."

"I will, sir. I promise."

"Very well," said Dumbledore, who looked as though the conversation had aged him half a decade. "I suppose the time has come."

"The time for what, sir?"

"The time for you to have the answer that I denied you last June." Harry's heart fluttered as his breath caught in his throat. "Do you remember what you asked me?"

"Why Voldemort wanted to kill me."

"Precisely. I told you then that I would tell you when your Occlumency was at a level I was comfortable with."

"And it's there?"

"It isn't," Dumbledore admitted. "Do not mistake me, you have made excellent progress this year, but there is much still to do."

"But you're going to tell me anyway?"

"I am."

"Is there a specific reason why?"

"Like I told you then, it is an answer you deserve to have. I now think it might be relevant to you much sooner than I had once hoped."

"Because you think Voldemort is getting stronger?"

"Voldemort is most certainly getting stronger; that is a large part of it, yes." The old man was tugging restlessly on his beard. Harry could tell this was not a decision he was fond of making. "I must warn you that the information may frighten you and that it may lead you to assume all manner of things. I will only give you a part of the full truth today. When you're older and your mind is stronger, then I will share it all. You have my word."

"I'm ready for whatever you'll tell me."

"Very well," said Dumbledore as he leant back in his chair and seemed to sag against its back. "Lord Voldemort attacked *you* because of a prophecy. One that he viewed as a danger to his very existence."

***The Great Hall***

***8:48 PM***

It had been two weeks since Harry, Ron, and Draco had united to slay Slytherin's monster, vanquish his heir, and close the Chamber of Secrets. Hogwarts had by now well and truly realized what had happened.

The Mandrake Draught had been brewed and the basilisk's petrified victims were finally awake and well again. Dumbledore had decided that a feast would be thrown in celebration, and Pansy had practically hung off Harry and Draco all night. It was a miracle, really. Harry sat with both his older set of friends and Draco's group. It was blissful to speak with Pansy and Theodore so openly, though Harry and Draco still scarcely shared a word.

They had not spoken since the blond had returned four days after the Chamber of Secrets had been closed. They had only shared a single glance when Draco had walked into the common room and seen Harry and Theodore sitting together. The youngest Malfoy had watched the both of them for a moment before slowly nodding to Harry and making his way over towards Crabbe and Goyle. That had effectively been him giving his blessing for Harry to openly associate with his group again and Harry had taken full advantage of it --- not that he needed it.

He had missed Theodore and Pansy, but he hadn't realized how badly until now. Between their company and the lack of students trying to kill him in the corridors, Harry felt lighter than he had since his argument with Draco all the way back in September. It was like his shackles were free and he could move again, or like he was a bird who had forgotten how to spread its wings and now finally remembered. It was liberating in a way that only escaping the Dursleys could match.

That had been one oddity over the past two weeks. Harry had written to Regulus more often than not since being released from the hospital wing after spending two days at Madam Pomfrey's tender mercy. Being told to call him Regulus had been odd, but not nearly as odd as writing to an adult so often. He and Narcisssa had written to each other frequently, but nothing like this. Harry thought he liked Regulus, but the verdict had not yet been finalized. There were also still his allegiances to consider and what they could mean for Harry.

Dumbledore had opened the festivities with an uplifting speech and by cancelling the exams for everyone who was not a fifth or seventh year due to everything that had happened. This had gotten him tumultuous applause so loud that Harry feared the cliff beneath the castle might well tremble so hard it would collapse.

That was only the beginning. Harry, Ron, and Draco had all been ambiguously presented with awards for 'special services to the school' and had each been given two hundred points for their respective houses. The Slytherin table cheered so loud that Harry swore he saw the windows quiver. This practically guaranteed them the House Cup unless anyone did something monumentally stupid.

They all feasted, chatted, and celebrated after that. It was the most fun Harry\'d had all year, but it was also exhausting. People were something he had all but avoided since being freed of the hospital wing, with the exception of those he actually liked. Now, everyone and their sister seemed to want his attention. Either to congratulate him on the award or, in most cases, to ask him what had happened in the Chamber of Secrets. The question had been easy to shrug off before regardless of what the school thought, but it wasn't so easy now. It was hardly difficult to put together. Harry, Ron, and Draco went missing in the middle of the night, the Chamber of Secrets allegedly closed, and then the three of them received shiny trophies two weeks later.

Harry found that he needed a break from it all. The chaotic hustling and bustling was beginning to wear on him. He found that sweat was clinging to him and that his muscles were beginning to tire from being tense for so long.

The air felt lighter and easier to breathe outside of the Great Hall. The further away from the drone of voices he got, the more and more he began to relax.

It was a wonderful feeling.

"I thought I'd find you out here eventually."

Harry startled at the voice and reached for his wand, but then the figure stepped out of the shadows and the torchlight made his blonde hair gleam like platinum fire.

"Draco?"

The boy glanced around the Entrance Hall. "Can we talk?"

Harry clamped down on his Occlumency to try and keep his mind clear. "If you'd like."

"I made a mistake," Draco admitted with the same air one might expect from somebody confessing to murder.

"Just one?"

"I was jealous." The words sounded like chalk on Draco's tongue; Harry was surprised he hadn't choked on them.

"Jealous of what, Draco?" Harry asked, his voice rising. This had been building for months, just like the confrontation he'd had with Draco's father.

"You---"

"Me?" Harry actually laughed; he couldn't help it. "What were you jealous of that I had? Not the fact I grew up with the scum of the earth and never knew about magic---"

"Harry---"

"Not the fact that my parents are dead, surely. You seem to get on with yours well enough---"

"It's not like that---"

"Then what is it like, Draco? You have everything anyone our age could ever want. Was it the stupid Quidditch position? Or the ring? Do I want to know how many gifts your father has bought you from Knockturn Alley?"

"It was stupid," Draco said with a grimace. "It... felt like Father was shoving me to the side and focusing only on you."

There it was again. Another sign that Lucius Malfoy had been playing him the whole time. Though if Draco hadn't known --- and Harry was sure he had not, for Draco could not act nearly this well --- then that was something. Perhaps it meant Diana had not been tainted by his schemes, or even that Narcissa was innocent as well. It was impossible to say.

"What do you want, Draco?" Harry asked bluntly. "I doubt you came here to talk about how awful a person you were. You've never been good at anything but praising yourself."

"To apologize," said Draco. "I... realize what I've done. You've forgiven me once and I'm not sure you'll do it again, but I'm sorry. I'd like to at least be on good terms again if we can."

Harry watched him very closely. He remembered all the times he had enjoyed with Draco. That first practice session when they and the others had chased around the abandoned classroom playing tag with Tickling Charms. He remembered how innocent they had been, how their laughter had filled the room until there was none of it left. It was so odd to contrast Harry then and now. He knew much had changed and he shivered at what he had been back then. It would be so easy to do what Harry of those days would have done and forgive Draco.

But the boy was right --- he had forgiven him once already and this year had taught Harry just how fickle people really were. Lucius Malfoy had used him, the student body had abused him, and both Draco and Daphne had betrayed him. Now one of them was asking for forgiveness just weeks after the school had suddenly forgotten all about their past claims and hailed Harry as a hero once more.

It all made him sick.

"I don't forgive you," Harry said coolly and Draco flinched back and lowered his head. "I'm not sure I'll ever forgive you... but, I won't hold it against you." That head of blonde hair rose again so that Harry could see his grey eyes once more. "We start from the beginning. I'll treat you decently if you treat me the same. We'll see what happens from there. I'm sick of getting stabbed in the back, Draco. I won't be letting it happen again."

"Deal," said Draco, stepping forward and extending his hand. Harry realized how much he'd grown this year. Harry's body was very slowly shrugging off the years of neglect on Privet Drive, but Draco had grown even more than he had. These were the sorts of observations that passed Harry by when the two had scarcely spoken all year.

Draco left him alone in the hall once their handshake was complete. Maybe Harry had been too easy on him; it was difficult to tell, but he remembered what he had told himself that day in the hospital wing while talking to the boy's father. If people were going to use him, sometimes, it was best to let it happen whether he liked it or not. Draco was a Malfoy and there was much a relationship with him could bring --- so Harry would at least try to humour him for now.

"Touching."

For the second time, Harry startled --- he really needed to learn how to detect people nearby. This voice was gruffer than Draco's and belonged to a man who sounded far older.

Harry recognized it and glanced over his shoulder. "Good evening, Professor."

"Evening, Potter," said Aberforth Dumbledore. "Come with me."

"Where are we going, sir?" Harry asked carefully as he trudged several feet behind the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor with his hand still on his wand.

"Just out for a stroll on the grounds. I want to talk to you and I don't want anyone hearing."

They walked in silence until the two of them passed through the large oak doors and out onto the grounds. It was a breezy night for late spring, but the wind was warm and pleasant. It licked more than it bit and its tongue left a comfortable sort of warmth behind.

"What is it you wanted to talk to me about, Professor?" Harry asked once they had travelled some distance from the castle.

"I wanted to talk about you and teach you some history."

"About me, sir?"

"Yes, Potter, that's what I said, isn't it?"

"Of course, sir."

The man paused in the shadow of a large oak tree and turned to face Harry. He was glaring. "I never trust anyone who speaks all that wish-wash. My brother's no better. Most of them are hapless arse-kissers who won't make a thing of themselves, but it's the ones who aren't you gotta worry about."

"You don't trust me," Harry said bluntly.

"Yes and no. I don't think you're malicious."

"But there's something about me you don't like."

"I don't like the path you're on and I don't like some things I see."

"What things?"

"Things like going straight to curses over school yard spats, things like hiding your emotions behind that damned hogwash my brother's been teaching you, things like how your only friends are upper years from shady families who supported Voldemort last time around."

Harry was almost surprised to hear someone other than the Headmaster use Voldemort's chosen name. Dumbledore was the only other person he'd ever heard speak it. He would have been taken aback had it been anyone else. For all the things he could say about Aberforth Dumbledore, he was no coward and his lack of regard was admirable, if foolish.

"Voldemort killed my parents," said Harry. "What do you expect me to do? Become his right-hand lieutenant?"

"Shared traits make for strange bedfellows." Something sinister loomed behind the professor's eyes; Harry was taken aback by how grim he looked. "Trust me, boy, I know better than anyone."

"So you're worried I'll side with Voldemort if he comes back?" Harry didn't ask how Aberforth seemed so certain the man was alive.

"Join him, take up his ideas, model some things after him. Nothing would surprise me. Not after the things I've seen."

"You keep hinting at that but you aren't saying anything. I'm taking it that\'s the history you want to teach me?"

"It is," the man agreed. "You're not the first kid I've seen with talent. There's my dear old brother, but his friend might have been better than he was. It's hard to say."

"Friend?"

"Something like that," Aberforth muttered. There was a stiffness about him now and his eyes appeared almost clouded by something. Sadness? Anger? Grief? It was hard to tell. "You all know my brother as this wonderful hero, but none of you know how close it was."

"How close it was to what?" Harry asked.

"How close he was to running off and making himself worse than Voldemort has ever been --- all because of a stupid goal that didn't even matter. All because he thought he was right over something that he wasn't. All because of *him*."

"I have a hard time imagining the Headmaster being worse than Voldemort."

"Oh, I'm sure, but you wouldn't if you knew what I knew. Hell, you might know soon enough with that Skeeter woman hovering like a damned vulture."

"The biography she's writing, you mean? You don't think that's all going to be lies?"

"It doesn't need to be. She has all the material she could ever want. All she needs to do is find it. If people only knew what my brother did, what our family dealt with." He shook his head. "We've strayed from the point. The point is that you walk down paths in life all the time. You think they're right but sometimes, they're not. The more talented you are, the worse those wrong paths get. Ask my brother about that some time; he'll wax poetic until the skin's rotted off of him."

"I'm not your brother," said Harry.

"You're not --- most people don't come back from what he almost did."

"What are you trying to tell me, Professor?"

"I'm trying to warn you. Monitor yourself and be honest about it. Don't lie to yourself; that's when the real problems start. Once they do, they're hard to stop. You're talented, Potter. I reckon you'll be damn good by the time you graduate --- maybe even as good as my brother was. Use that talent for the right things or you'll have big problems on your hands."

Harry's eyes narrowed as his fingers twitched towards his wand. "Are you threatening me, Professor?"

"Just warning you. It's the freedom and the confidence that kills. They think they can do anything, then it all comes crashing back down." He shook his head. "I came here to watch you. I'm telling you what I see and giving you more honest advice than anyone else will give before I'm gone."

"Gone?" asked Harry. "Why would you be gone? Nothing's happened to you; you've beaten the curse."

Aberforth chuckled darkly as he pulled his black cloak more tightly around him. "Wait for Skeeter's book and then tell me I beat the curse. My brother has enough titles to give up. He'll give away one of them to appease the rioters when the storm blows in and then wait for it to blow over, but he'll never give this up." He gestured to the shadowy outline of the castle behind them. "Me... I won't be sticking around for all of that nonsense. Albus and his wise old ass can keep it."

Harry didn't know what to say as Aberforth walked away and back up towards the castle. It was one of the stranger and more ominous conversations he could ever remember partaking in.

***June 4, 1993***

***The Black Lake***

***1:33 AM***

Harry had awoken from another vivid dream. This was one he could hardly remember upon waking. Voldemort had spoken to someone about their commitment. He had questioned whether they had what it took to do what must be done in the end. The man had looked more terrified than Harry had ever seen anyone look before. Harry thought his face had been familiar, but it was little more than a blinking shadow in his memory now.

Not remembering somehow made it worse. Humans feared the unknown for a reason. It was a terrible and monstrous thing --- cloaked in shadow, immeasurably large, and unimaginably powerful. Its claws reached out every now and then and trapped humans in their vices. Only when the time came for it to reveal a part of itself did it relinquish its hold. That time had not yet come and Harry found that his heart was having a difficult time slowing down.

Harry's memory must have been faulty that night. He hardly remembered dressing and leaving the dungeons, throwing on his invisibility cloak for good measure.

It was even later than when he typically explored and the castle was as quiet as death. Not even the reanimated Mrs. Norris stumbled across his path and since gaining back life and mobility, she had stalked around the castle with renewed vigour.

It was much the opposite of the night he had spent traipsing around the grounds with the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor. The grounds were as quiet as the castle. It was a hot, windless night. The loudest sound Harry could hear was that of his own feet moving as quietly as they could through the grass as he walked down the sloping lawns and towards the Black Lake. There was not a cloud in sight. The grounds may have been quiet, but they were flooded with moonlight.

Harry saw him from far away thanks to said light. A figure sitting near the edge of the Black Lake. No stones were thrown, no water was disturbed, and not so much as a blade of grass seemed to shift around him. The boy was sitting so still that for a moment, Harry thought he had fallen asleep.

When he drew closer, he began to understand. His red hair seemed darker than it usually was tonight and he looked gaunter than Harry had ever seen him.

"You couldn't sleep either, huh?"

He didn't know what made him say it. The two of them had never shared a friendly conversation even though they had never quarrelled the way Weasley had with Draco. The closest they had come was whilst playing Quidditch against one another, but Harry had spent the vast majority of that match trying not to die.

The boy looked up at him with glassy eyes that quickly cleared as recognition filled them, followed by something akin to trepidation. Harry could see the hesitation, the pondering over what to say or whether to speak it all. Finally, Weasley nodded.

"I've barely slept since the chamber."

"Mind if I sit?" Weasley shook his head and moved over to allow Harry a seat. It was a nice view. "Did you know her?" Harry asked.

Weasley took a shuddering breath. "My little sister did. She was around the orchard near our house a couple of times, but I never really talked to her. She was... weird."

"That doesn't make it any easier."

There was an odd fire in Weasley's eyes, almost like Harry had offended him. "How would you know?"

Harry pondered for a moment, drumming his fingers upon his knee as he considered Weasley. What he wanted to do was foolish, but it made sense to him. The one thing he had never managed to let go from first year was the way Longbottom had died. Not the death itself, but the way it had come. It had been his doing and this would be the best chance Harry had to morally wash his hands of the deed.

"You're not the only one who's seen someone die."

"You remember?" Weasley asked.

"Remember what?"

"Well, uh..."

Then, Harry realized what he meant. "I wasn't talking about my parents, but I remember... bits of that night. Not much of it." Harry actually saw Weasley's mouth open before he forced it closed. Doubtlessly, he wanted to ask some kind of question. Harry was in a morbidly cynical mood, so he obliged him. "I remember Voldemort more than them." Weasley recoiled from the name and Harry sighed. "Grow up, you've fought against some form of him twice and survived both times. I don't understand why you're so scared of his name."

"Sorry," Weasley said, blushing. "It's just... I've only ever heard Dumbledore say it."

"Dumbledore told me to say it. He said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. Anyway, I remember him more than anything else. His laugh and his eyes. That's really it, other than a bunch of green light and a bad pain where my scar is."

"Why are you telling me all this?"

Harry cocked his head to the side. "Entirely selfless reasons, I promise."

Weasley snorted. "Slimy git. I doubt the lot of you have done anything selfless in your lives."

"Draco and I went into the chamber." Weasley looked away from him. "There's something else bothering you," Harry said slowly.

"What do you mean?"

"Something happened in the chamber while I was duelling Riddle. I... kind of lost track of everything. Something else is bothering you; it's more than just seeing Lovegood die."

Weasley gave him a strange look. Harry could see that the boy wanted to tell him. He probably hadn't told anyone and was filled to bursting with whatever it was.

"Promise me you won't go blabbing about it? Not even to Dumbledore?"

Harry narrowed his eyes. "That bad, huh?" Weasley just nodded. "If you promise to do the same for something you deserve to know, then you have a deal."

The two of them shook hands and Weasley took another of those deep, shuddering breaths. "I killed her."

Harry stiffened. "You did what?"

"I killed her," he whispered. "I didn't mean to, but... but... the sword. I...I tried to stab the snake, but-but." Tears were rolling down Weasley's cheeks. They looked like liquid glitter in the moonlight as they fell and Harry stared at him, transfixed. This was all so horribly twisted. The luck some people had... the universe had to be playing some sort of cosmic joke. "She was my sister's friend," Weasley was going on, "and I... I..."

"Made a mistake." There were very few things Ron Weasley could have said to make Harry sympathize with him, but he had hit on the biggest one at the moment.

"But-but... she didn't deserve that. I... it's horrible. I'm horrible."

"If you're horrible, Weasley, I'd rather not think of what that makes me."

Weasley's head jerked up, suddenly too surprised to sob. "What?"

"Dumbledore lied to you."

"What are you---"

"He lied to you to hide two truths. One of them, he was afraid of getting out. The other, he hid for my sake." Weasley looked almost hypnotized, peering at Harry with wide, curious eyes. "Neville Longbottom never died in the final chamber underneath the school last June."

Weasley was as still as the moment Harry had first found him here. "You're sure?"

"Positive," said Harry, steeling himself for the worst. "I... I killed him."

Harry expected Weasley to rage at him, curse him, or perhaps even try and kill him, but he just sat there in silence for nearly a minute. "How did it happen?"

"Quirrell came out of that corridor with the Philosopher's Stone and with Longbottom as a hostage. Don't ask me how I was there; it was literally dumb luck. He tried to recruit me before Dumbledore showed up. The two of them had a standoff. Quirrell told Dumbledore to let him leave with the stone or else he'd kill Longbottom."

Weasley was gaping at him now. This was all new to him. Dumbledore had told him none of it and the shock showed clearly upon his face. It made him look like some sort of gaping zombie in the eerie setting and sparkling moonlight.

"I thought I could help." Harry's voice didn't break, but it was a near thing; a hoarse whisper that could have passed for the wind playing tricks on Weasley's ears, yet the boy had heard it. "I tried to ambush Quirrell... he was faster than me. Dumbledore was going to let him go. If I'd left him, Longbottom might still be alive."

Weasley's eyes looked dazed, but he shook his head very slowly as if to clear his thoughts. "Why are you telling me this?" he asked for the second time.

"Guilt. It's the one thing from that night I haven't been able to let go. This is the closest I can get to paying Longbottom back. I didn't know him, but I think he'd want you to know." He hesitated. "You can tell Granger if you want, just... make sure no one else knows."

The two boys sat there in silence as several crickets began to pipe up. Something splashed in the water not far from where Harry sat and he could feel a light spray against his face. It was a nice way to break the heat, but it did nothing to ease the silence between the two second-year boys.

"Merlin, this is so messed up," Weasley muttered.

"Twisted," Harry agreed.

"I don't blame you." Harry's head snapped around. He had been looking out over the lake until Weasley's last words, but he was peering at the boy now. "It wasn't your fault," he said. "You were trying to save him. You're all right with me." He held out his hand.

Harry considered him for a moment before taking it slowly. "And you with me. Lovegood's death wasn't your fault. You were fighting a basilisk. The fact any of us made it out alive is a miracle and you and Draco saved my life. Riddle would have killed me had you not killed the snake and had he not destroyed the book."

"I'll kill him," Ron said quietly. "You-kn... Voldemort."

Harry watched him closely. "Plenty of people tried; he killed some of the best witches and wizards alive." Harry remembered Hagrid's words that first night out on the rock when he had told him the truth.

*"No one ever lived after he decided ter kill \'em, no one except you, an\' he\'d killed some o\' the best witches an\' wizards of the age --- the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts..."*

"I'll die trying if he's out there," Weasley promised.

And Harry knew it was true. The force in his words could not be ignored --- Voldemort really had made an enemy in Ron Weasley and this enemy would not stop trying until he or Voldemort were dead.

***June 19, 1993***

***The Trophy Room***

***9:41 AM***

*Tom Marvolo Riddle*

The name was everywhere in this room. Exam records, acknowledgements of academic excellence, even something called the Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional Spell-Casting.

And, of course, the award for special services to the school --- the one that rested directly beside Harry's.

He wasn't sure if he hated Voldemort. He had once, but he was coming to agree with him about some things. He hated what he had done to his parents and, by extension, him, but the man himself seemed almost unreal to Harry. It was difficult to formulate an opinion on him one way or the other.

What Harry did know was that the thought of becoming another Voldemort made him shiver. It haunted his dreams and crept through his psyche like slow-acting poison.

He needed to be better than Riddle in every way imaginable. He would avoid the pitfalls Voldemort fell into and he would obliterate every one of these records. It was the only way he would ever put an end to the idea that they were similar.

Harry heard movement from behind him and he whirled to face it.

"Harrikins!" called a burly redhead Harry knew well.

Well... he knew the two of them well --- Harry actually had no idea which one was which.

"Terrors," he said with a cold glare. He did not relinquish the grip he held on his wand. "What do you want?"

"Not to fight," said one twin.

"Not with the one who closed the Chamber of Secrets," said the other.

"That would be a death wish!"

Harry gave them nothing. "Aww, come on," said the second twin. "You can tell us."

"I don't make a habit of telling people things after they've made my life hell all year."

The twins exchanged looks. "Uh... funny you should say that," said the second twin. "We're... huh, that is to say..."

"Oh, stop blubbering, Forge," said the first twin, turning to Harry. "Look, we fucked up. There isn't really any two ways about it."

"We thought you were the Heir of Slytherin like a lot of people did and we take things further than most people."

"It's our specialty."

"We'd like to apologize," they both said together.

"Seriously, mate," said the second, "we didn't ever mean for it to go as far as it did. We assumed, it escalated, and... we fucked up. Bad."

"I'll accept your apology if you answer me a question." The twins both looked worried, but they nodded. "Were you the ones who rigged that exploding statue that almost killed me?"

"Er..." said the first.

"Yes and no," said the second. "We always planned to attack you and send you to the hospital wing, but we never planned on *that*."

"Then how did it happen?" Harry asked with narrowed eyes.

The second twin hesitated and the first smacked him upside the head. "Oh, come off it, the kid almost died --- he deserves to know." He turned to Harry. "We hadn't figured out plans yet and then we got a letter from someone offering help. They said they were a Runes expert and that they could rig something to take you out... we didn't realize they meant permanently."

"We did the setup," said the second twin, "but the runes were all them. We just figured out where you usually walked, rigged the trap, and waited."

This was actually even more disturbing. At least if it had been the twins, Harry wouldn't have needed to consider any new and dangerous enemies. This was troubling. Someone who was more vicious than them after him? Something lurked at the corner of his mind, a half-formed idea that he couldn't quite put together.

"Who sent you the letter?" he asked.

They exchanged looks one final time before speaking words that would set Harry's anger ablaze, words that would make Harry crave vengeance for the first time in his life.

"Daphne Greengrass," they said as one.

***A little over an hour later, atop the Astronomy Tower...***

From the top of Hogwarts' highest tower, one could see the Hogwarts Express pulling out of Hogsmeade station and beginning to slither away from the castle like a great, crimson snake. The day was fair but unremarkable. It was warm and windless, but clouds covered the sky far above and hid the sun from sight. The bright train with its golden letters stood out starkly in the conditions even from afar as a pale figure wearing black robes stained with silvery blood watched it pull away.

"I thought I might find you here," said a familiar voice from behind the ghost. The Bloody Baron did not turn. He simply waited for his counterpart to glide soundlessly up beside him and take his own post looking out over the castle's grounds, Hogsmeade, the mountains, and the speeding Hogwarts Express.

"A wise guess then," said the Baron in that deep, carrying voice he so seldom used.

Nearly-Headless Nick chuckled from beside him. "My dear Baron, it was hardly a guess at all with how much time you've spent here as of late."

"It is a quiet place where I can think."

"Yes, we've all noticed you haven't been rattling those chains of yours much lately."

The Bloody Baron finally turned to glare at his transparent companion. "What is it you want, Nicholas?"

"To ask if you have taken leave of your senses."

"You dare---"

"Yes, Baron, I dare. Do you forget what happened the last time we meddled at this castle? Lest we forget what happened the last time one of our number spilled secrets they ought to have kept to themselves?"

"Helena was coerced---"

"Far too easily---"

"Enough!" His voice cut through the air with efficiency the axe swung at Nick centuries ago had never had. "You push too far. I am not Helena! I have not been charmed by some foolish child with delusions of grandeur. I have watched longer than you, Nicholas, watched since before your living spirit was even thought of. I care naught for your warnings, nor for your lectures. Make your point and leave."

"I think you have made a mistake involving yourself in the affairs of the students at such a critical time."

"If I had not involved myself, there would be no students here to speak of."

"Perhaps not, but perhaps that would be for the best. You know what is to come as well as I do."

"His return will not herald the demise of this castle. He treasures it too deeply and respects its master too much."

"And what if it is not him I speak of?"

The Baron's eyes flashed. "Guard your tongue---"

"No, open your eyes. It is happening again just like it happened fifty years ago. Do you not see what the boy is? Do you not see what he is to become?"

The Bloody Baron stared at Nearly-Headless Nick with those dark, unblinking eyes. "What of it?"

Nick spluttered. "What of it?" he asked incredulously. "Baron, you know what they say of the last of your students to ascend in such a manner! You know what he has done! You know what he is!"

The Baron met Nick's eyes one final time before speaking his parting words and gliding back down the tower.

"I know that history is written by the victors, Nicholas. You will come to learn in time that not all creatures of darkness come forth to spread evil."

***June 21, 1993***

***Little Hangleton***

***12:00 AM***

Harry hated being so frail. There was nothing worse than the feeling of panic that had gripped him as the slender woman had lowered him gently into the cauldron.

The liquid had looked just like water, although it felt like anything but. Harry heard the loud hissing sound as he held his breath and submerged. He began to tremble almost at once. The potion ripped at him like a thousand leeches and the worst had not yet begun. The frailness made him rage. Any human would have been able to tolerate this, but it was among the worst pain Harry had ever felt, eclipsed only by that fateful night his power had been lost.

Something floated down into the cauldron. Harry felt it caress him on the way down, but he paid it no mind. Opening his eyes was something he did not dare do --- despite the potion's appearance, it was anything but water.

He could feel it heat up around him as though to illustrate his point. There was now irritation as well as pain. His scaly skin itched more persistently than a niffler digging for gold.

He turned his mind inwards --- he was the greatest sorcerer alive with a grip on the Mind Arts no one could match; this process would not conquer him.

His mind was forced clear of all but the excitement surrounding what was to come by the time he heard the splash. Harry felt it brush up against him and he recoiled. It was disgusting. No part of his feeble servant should touch him.

Yet he was too weak to move away on his own and by the time the blood taken back in January trickled into the cauldron, his concentration had broken, though it mattered not.

No amount of Occlumency could have prepared him for what came next. It was that horrible Samhain all over again. Every part of him exploded outwards as an indescribable pain gripped him and he was torn from the pathetic shell. It was all for the pursuit of greatness, but that did not lessen the pain. For a split-second, Harry wished for weakness again. Anything but this; he would suffer through anything to end this all-consuming pain.

It was over as fast as it had begun. The sound of hissing steam filled his ears as sensations other than pain returned to him just as he realized he could rise at long last.

He did so reverently, surveying all around him with those red, pupil-less eyes.

The graveyard was just like he remembered from all those years ago. Tombstones were arrayed in simple lines and all was quiet but for the steaming cauldron and the caw of a raven somewhere off in the distance. It was difficult to see through the clouds of thick steam, but Harry thought he saw the one who had sacrificed for him lying on the grass and cradling the place where a finger had been for all his life.

Then the steam billowed, taking with it the unnatural heat that had swaddled him and exposing him to the world for the first time in nearly twelve long years.

The first breeze of summer tickled his milk-white skin as he peered out at the few faces around him and smiled with glee the likes of which none had ever known, glee the likes of which one could never know until they had seen Death, spat in his face, and returned to the might they had once wielded.

So good it was to feel the soft air against his bare skin, so good it was to smile with real lips, so good it was to be whole once more.

**BOOK 3:**

**HARRY POTTER AND THE LOOMING OF SHADOWS**

**COMING LATER IN 2022**

**Author's Endnote:**

**It feels quite surreal to have finished the second book in this series. I'm sure many of you have put a lot of things together about this year. For those who haven't, it will all be explained in book 3.**

**Following that same line of thought, I will be recording a podcast soon during which I answer fan questions about book 2 and the story in general. If anyone has questions for that, either message me on here, leave it in the reviews, or join my Discord server, where there are dedicated channels for this kind of thing. I will also definitely be writing a blog post in which I discuss book 2 at some point. I'll be announcing that's release when I write it via Twitter and Discord, so feel free to join the server and/or follow me on Twitter.**

**I know some people have trouble with the Discord link, but this is most often because you need to update your browser. If that doesn't work, find my website via a generic Google search of my pen name and use the direct link on the homepage. There are over 3,300 people on there who are always willing to discuss any number of things, so I encourage everyone to check it out. They will also get book 3 chapters AT LEAST a month before FFN or AO3.**

**I should probably mention that the scene with Nick and the Bloody Baron was probably inspired by the one in *Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin.* I don't remember that scene well, but I can't confidently say mine wouldn't have happened without it, so credit where credit is due.**

**There will be a meaningful delay in posting between books whilst I outline the third instalment of this series, but I'll try not to keep you all waiting for too long. My current goal is to begin posting book 3 here in the summer, but that is by no means set in stone and may very well change.**

**If you don't want to wait, the first five chapters of book 3 are already posted on my P\*T\*E\*N page. I'll be consistently updating this story over there and it will not be posted here until I finish book 3 or at least get close to doing so.

** Until then, enjoy my other works and stay tuned for the twists and turns still to come.**

**Please read and review.**

**Thank you to all of the lovely Discord Editors who left edits on early-access drafts over on the Discord server at some point during the course of book 2:**

**ArtyWords, Asmodeus Stahl, Bart, Gamerin4d, Idefix, Kaido, Mrs. ACI, NB, Newuser, PrideInMoi, Rabul, rawmeat898Deprogrammer, Sakkiko, The Darkling, and Zare**

**A massive thank you is also extended to my Othrian-level patron, ShadowWolf, for his incredibly generous support on that platform!**

**PS: THERE WILL BE A DELAY OF SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THE START OF BOOK 3, BUT THAT WAIT CAN BE CIRCUMVENTED BY SIGNING UP TO MY P\*T\*E\*N PAGE. CHAPTERS WILL BE POSTED CONSISTENTLY OVER THERE. DISCORD MEMBERS WILL ALSO STAY AT LEAST A MONTH AHEAD OF FFN AND AO3 DURING BOOK 3, SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO JOIN THE DISCORD SERVER IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY.**

These do not appear until much later in the year and they are not sexual in nature, but I thought it was worth prefacing. This choice was made because they contain some sensitive subject matter I won't post on here. I have written them so that they are not essential, but they add a fair bit of additional context. There will be ANs marking those chapters.**

**Book 3: The Looming of Shadows**

**Chapter 1: Dangerous Secrets**

***July 8, 1899***

***Godric's Hollow***

***3:14 PM***

Godric's Hollow was a quaint little place that reminded Gellert of Kirchdorf. A squat town square made up the village's centre, surrounded by dense thickets of trees. Muggles dwelled here just like back home. Gellert's lip curled. *Their taint is everywhere.*

Britain was just as bad as Germany. Gellert had arrived here just last night and asked his aunt whether or not Godric's Hollow was made up only of witches and wizards. She had laughed and told him that the nearest purely wizarding settlement was miles away in a place called Hogsmeade. *Disgusting.*

This was the first time Gellert had been so close to muggles in years. How he craved to draw his wand and dole out justice. He could use one of them. The experiment that had him thrown from Durmstrang need not have been wasted. It would be merciful --- better that than to live without magic.

Gellert turned off the cobblestone walkway and up to the front door of a small home surrounded by a high fence whose wood was peeling. It looked a sorry sight, but he could feel the magic saturating every inch. *These people have sense keeping the muggles away. Aunt Bathilda keeps decent company.*

Gellert knocked thrice upon the door, then waited. No sound came but it soon opened, revealing a thin boy who brushed auburn hair away from piercing blue eyes. *There's a sharpness in his stare*.

"Good afternoon."

"Good afternoon. You are Albus Dumbledore?"

"I am, yes. Who might you be?"

"My name is Gellert Grindelwald. I believe you know my Aunt Bathilda?"

"I do. She's been a good friend of the family. Has she sent you?"

"She offers your family invitations to join us tonight." Keeping his voice level became difficult. "She believes the two of us will get on well."

The first thing his aunt said upon his arrival was how much he reminded her of this Albus Dumbledore. No one had ever been like Gellert. Why his aunt thought differently now, he knew not.

Dumbledore's face twitched. He looked bitter, but only for a heartbeat.

"Is something the matter?"

"There are just things that might make attending more difficult than it ought to be."

*This boy's not like me at all. Nothing would stop me from doing as I wanted.* The longer he watched, the more he thought he was missing something. Dumbledore looked wary. *Does he know of me? Has my reputation spread, or is my aunt a blabbermouth?*

Gellert looked up and met those eyes again. A small girl wept beneath a canopy of bright green leaves. The leaves began changing --- green, then orange, then brown --- and tumbled from the trees, dead by the time they reached the ground.

Sharp pain stabbed behind his eyes. He caught it and twisted, reaching out for another strand of memory. His psychic fingers were brushed aside. *An occlumens.*

Those blue eyes widened, but then Dumbledore's expression smoothed. "Tell your aunt that I, at least, will attend. My sister is sick and I'm unsure whether she or my brother will make it."

Gellert bowed his head. *He is more than I expected.* "Good day to you, Dumbledore."

"Grindelwald," Gellert tilted his head to the side. "I expect you won't treat my family so invasively if and when you meet them."

A thin smile crested his lips. "I would never dream of it."

"I'm surprised you waited as long as you did to start showing me memories again," said Harry, peering around the tower cell.

"I am generous to those who deserve my courtesy."

"So you knew Dumbledore before the duel?"

"I knew him better than anyone alive except perhaps his own brother."

"What was he like?"

"Albus?"

"No, Aberforth. He taught Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts last year."

Grindelwald tilted his head. "And you were not fond of him?"

"I don't know."

"How is this?"

"It's a long story. He just picked a rough way to go about things."

Grindelwald's lips twitched. "That sounds characteristic."

"I never knew he had a sister."

"I am unsurprised. Albus always liked his secrets. That one was guarded closely." Grindelwald peered out from between the bars covering his window, then looked back at him. "Do you have any more questions?"

Harry chewed his words, trying to choose the right ones. "When you walked up to the door, I could feel magic; it was all over the house."

"It pleases me that you noticed. What did it feel like?"

It suddenly struck Harry how mad this all was. The way they talked, it was like nothing had ever been wrong. *Get over it; if he wanted to kill you, you'd be dead. Think how much you'll learn.* "It felt... thick, maybe heavy. I don't know how to explain it."

"Oppressive."

"Yeah, that." There was a pause. "So what was that all about?"

Grindelwald interlaced his fingers. "There was a collection of wards. I had mastered the ability to sense magic --- you experienced that in the memory."

"Sense magic?" Harry remembered feeling waves of something rolling off the Mirror of Erised. *Was I doing it then without realizing? Like how I made things happen before Hogwarts?*

"The craft is invaluable but immensely complex. You will master it in time."

Harry perked up. "Will I?"

"You will."

"How?"

Grindelwald smirked. "I intend to help you master many things now that we are on such open terms."

***July 11, 1993***

***The Burrow***

***9:12 AM***

Ron nearly slammed his head against the kitchen table, his mother's scream echoing inside his skull. He grimaced, shutting his eyes against the noise. *One of these days, she'll break a window.*

Something did break. Percy flinched, slamming his hand against a cup and sending it tumbling to the floor. Ron's elder brother flushed. He would be able to fix things like that with magic in just over a month, but not quite yet.

"Arthur!" Molly shouted. His father was moving towards the door to leave for work. "Arthur, come back! We won!"

Ron heard his father's footsteps halt. "Won?"

"Yes, Arthur! Won! The galleon draw! We won!"

Ron suddenly realized that his mother was crying. He exchanged uncomfortable looks with the twins as the sound of their father's footsteps returned. *Galleon draw?*

"Did we really?" he asked once back, moving behind his wife's chair and reading that morning's *Daily Prophet* over her shoulder. "Merlin, we really won."

Ron watched as his mother leapt up and hugged his father, sobbing into his chest.

*This is nice and all, but do they have to do it here?* A grin spread across his face regardless.

Smiling felt odd. That expression had been so scarce since leaving the Chamber of Secrets that Ron had almost forgotten what it felt like.

The only times he had smiled were when Cedric was over, much like last summer. *If only he knew what really happened.*

Thinking about that just made him remember blonde hair pooled around an innocent face, crimson fingers reaching from her chest, spreading across the dark stone floor.

His nightmares made those memories worse. Ron wasn't alone in his suffering, though regret tugged so hard at him that he felt it in his stomach. Luna had been one of Ginny's oldest friends. Never had they been thick as thieves, but he still heard her sobbing from her bedroom the first few nights and knew how it felt to lose a friend. He ought to have gone to her, but what would he say? *I can't even figure myself out; it's not like I could help her.*

*Idiot! Snap out of it! First good thing that happens all summer and you're ruining it.* "What are we going to do with it?" his mother was asking.

"We need to save," his father said, scratching his balding head. "Merlin knows we can't let ourselves get so low on gold again."

His mother tutted. "Yes, but it's seven hundred galleons! We can save half and still do something special."

"Let's think about it; there's no need to do anything rash." His father looked out the kitchen window while he straightened his robes. "I really must be off."

"Yes, yes, get to the ministry."

Something special? *Weird. Mum's always nervous about spending money.* Then he looked across the table and saw the shadows beneath Ginny's eyes. The pain in his stomach returned, tenfold now. *It's because of everything that's happened... Merlin, why is everything my fault?*

***July 17, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***8:53 AM***

Harry was fond of the dining hall at Black Manor. Probably because it was the opposite of the one he'd grown up with on Privet Drive. Vernon and Petunia\'s was bright, flanked by white walls. The one at Black Manor was set before towering windows made from black stained glass dimming any light that entered.

Harry sat waiting at the table, lit by a handful of floating candles. The loud crack accompanying Kreacher's appearance no longer startled him. "Can Kreacher be making Master Harry breakfast?"

Harry smiled, still bemused. *Merlin*, he thought, *we've come a long way in a month.*

***Earlier...***

The train slowed, King's Cross Station looming up ahead. *No kidnappings this time; I'll take that as a win.* The entire journey felt like a dream. Tension still remained between Harry and Draco, but being able to talk with Pansy and Theodore made up for that. *I can't believe how natural it feels after so much time.*

The platform was full to bursting. They all filed behind Crabbe and Goyle, who forced a path through the crowd of bodies.

Draco went to his father the moment they found him, but Theodore placed a hand on Harry's arm. "I might not see you for a while."

Harry raised an eyebrow. "Why not? Are you and your father travelling again?"

Theodore's face was unreadable. "No, I don't think so. Father just wants my help with some things."

Images flashed behind his eyes. Tiberius Nott sitting at a long table, curtains drawn across the window behind him. The world bathed in billowing steam, blissful air tickling chalk-white skin.

A shiver ran up Harry's spine. *What was that last one?* "Hopefully he doesn't keep you busy all summer," said Harry, feigning a smile.

"I'm sure I'll slip away for your birthday." Theodore held out his hand and Harry took it, shaking firmly. "Take care, Harry."

"You too, Theodore, have a nice summer."

Not until Theodore and the Malfoys left did Harry remove a raven-shaped pendant from his pocket. "Toujours Pur."

Something tugged behind his naval. His heart raced, breath caught in his chest as the world blurred around him. *Get a grip! This one was planned; you're not being kidnapped!*

Harry's feet slammed against a well-polished floor. *This must be the entrance hall.* Obsidian pillars flanked towering windows obscured by dark curtains. A mosaic sprawled across the floor; a field of blooming roses beneath a star-filled sky. Plinths were interspersed around the hall's edge, each topped with a raven carved from stone.

*CRACK!*

The oldest elf he'd ever seen appeared. Wispy white hair sprouted from its ears, its teeth past rotting and its grey skin hung in places.

"Kreacher's new master is here, and what a master he is, tainted by muggle filth. They say he lived with them. What would my mistress say?"

"Something foul if she was sensible." The elf looked up, wide-eyed. Harry almost laughed. "Did you expect me to defend them?"

Kreacher's ears perked. "Master doesn't seem tainted to Kreacher."

Harry scowled. "You can't live with muggles and not be tainted."

Kreacher frowned. "Kreacher is confused by his new master."

***Back in the present...***

"Yes, please. I'll take some eggs with bacon and toast."

Kreacher bowed so low his nose scraped against the floor, then he was gone with another loud *CRACK.*

"I don't know how you've won him over so quickly," said Regulus, sipping at his tea.

Harry shrugged. "It wasn't that hard. I just acted like a pureblood and let him know I hated muggles."

"That does go a long way in this family, yes."

"Your mother's portrait probably didn't hurt."

"No, I imagine not." Regulus chuckled. "My dear old mother would die another death if she realized she was teaching a halfblood."

Regulus said his mother had gone insane, but her portrait here was done long before that happened. Harry could see the seeds of madness, but she was relatively sane. There had only been a few outbursts whilst she taught him the finer points of wizarding etiquette, and none about him. The moment Regulus introduced him as a pureblood heir and the best friend of Narcissa Black's son, all had gone smoothly.

Regulus had still been concerned, warning him before that first meeting. *"So long as you don't bring up muggles, muggleborns, Grindelwald, the Dark Lord, or my brother, you should be fine."*

*"Is that all?"*

*"Probably not, but those are the important ones. Best not mention that you're a halfblood, but we've covered that already."*

"What are you reading?" Harry asked as he took the chair nearest Regulus, who held something too thick to be that morning's paper.

"I ordered you a copy --- here." The Black Lord withdrew his wand and gave it a flick, summoning a rectangular box. Harry frowned and opened it.

His breath caught. An auburn-haired teenager stared out at him from the cover with familiar blue eyes, arm in arm with a blond-haired youth who could only be Grindelwald.

Harry removed the book, turning it to read the back cover.

*Stripping away the serene facade of silver-haired wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals all. A disturbed childhood and lawless youth, lifelong feuds forming from a suspicious demise, guilty secrets leading to the death of millions --- all of this and more is uncovered in the riveting* Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore*.*

***July 18, 1993***

***The Headmaster's Office***

***9:00 PM***

A strong summer wind blew outside, rattling panes of glass. Fawkes lifted his head and peered at Severus, then out the large window. The sky was a deep shade of purple and the light was fading fast.

A clock chimed and Dumbledore looked up from a heaping stack of papers. "I apologize for my tardiness. Thank you for coming, Severus."

Severus inclined his head. "I am here to serve, Headmaster."

"A fact for which I will always be grateful." *His smile is too strained. His news is dire.*

Severus curled his lip. "I presume you have not brought me here to offer the position I have long thirsted for?"

Dumbledore smiled a sad smile. "I'm afraid not. You are much too valuable; I would not leave you to the mercy of Lord Voldemort's curse."

Severus suppressed a shudder at the Dark Lord's name. *He says it with no regard for those around him.* "What of your brother? He is safe and whole; I see no obvious signs of a curse."

Dumbledore opened a desk drawer and removed a thick book, his own face smiling up from the front cover. "Have you paid Miss Skeeter's work much mind?"

"I have read some. My faith in her writing is low."

Dumbledore sighed. "She has done well this time around. I fear how she learned these pages' secrets, but many are true."

Severus studied him. "You fear how she learned them?"

"She writes about things only three living people know of. I told her nothing, nor did Aberforth."

"Who is the third?"

"Bathilda Bagshot. A delightful woman who is well past her age and vulnerable to the whims of youth."

His lip curled again, bile rising in the back of his throat. "Have you not reported her?"

"Not while Lucius Malfoy holds such a tight grip on much of the ministry. Reports may be seen as flustered defences. That is the last thing I need after the school's recent fiasco."

"What does any of this have to do with your brother and the curse?"

Dumbledore put the book down on his desk. "This book taints Aberforth as well as I. He knew it would when it was announced and resigned. Had he stayed, the parents and governors would have forced his hand."

Severus narrowed his eyes. "Does it not slander you more fiercely?"

"It does."

"And you intend to remain at Hogwarts?"

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "I have advantages Aberforth does not and am not so easily replaced, if you will pardon my arrogance."

*The two greatest wizards I have ever known and the difference between each is so stark.* "If you wish to blame the curse for Skeeter's writings, then very well. What is it you summoned me for?"

"I wished to ask if there were any signs pointing to Lord Voldemort's return?"

Severus crushed a flash of shock and kept his face schooled. "Signs?" Something nagged at him, but it slipped through his fingers each time he reached for it. *Strange.*

"Yes. I think it is suspicious his evil has touched Hogwarts two years in a row. That is saying nothing about Tiberius Nott's newest accessory."

Severus paused. "Newest... accessory?"

"Tiberius wears a glove any time I have seen him in public. It is a queer choice that I consider suspicious."

*Why must the world's greatest wizard be so utterly mad?* "I fail to see a connection between the Dark Lord and a glove."

Dumbledore's smile returned, bitter this time. "Do you? Answer me something, Severus. If you were to concoct a ritual that might return Voldemort to his powers, how would you do it?"

*Ah... ominous.* "There would be blood," he admitted.

"Sacrifice, yes, one of the few things powerful enough to achieve what he seeks. I suspect many might be surprised if they looked beneath that glove."

His pulse quickened. *Bloody hell.* "So you think the Dark Lord has returned?"

"I am unsure. The ritual could simply have returned him to a rudimentary form. When I faced him in that corridor more than a year ago, he was scarcely a shadow."

Severus cleared his mind; he had bargained for none of this. "I have heard nothing. None of the old guard trust me completely. People like Lucius remain amiable, but many consider me a traitor."

"Yes," said Dumbledore, scratching at his beard. "I had hoped for other signs, though I don't know what they would be." That nagging returned, but Severus ignored it. *My mind is playing tricks, how strange.* "Do keep your eyes peeled and watch out for Harry."

Rage built inside him. *How am I to watch a boy who cares nothing for himself?* He sneered. "I hope only that Potter has heeded my warnings."

Dumbledore shoved the book back into the drawer it came from. "Is that what you call them, Severus? I have heard you were most unpleasant this past year."

"If the boy would read between the lines, he would know that I am advising caution and responsibility. It is all good so long as Lily's magic protects him, but there are others to consider. I hoped that pairing him with the Crabbe dolt would prompt greater consideration for those around him."

Dumbledore's lips curved down. "You have strange ways of making your point. Regardless, watch him for me?"

Severus stood, bowing before he left the room. "Always."

**Book 3: The Looming of Shadows**

**Chapter 2: Black Tidings**

***July 24, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***4:13 PM***

Heavy black curtains were pulled shut over towering windows, plunging the Black family library into darkness except for the candles and torches burning throughout the room. The shelves reached up so high that some of them were lost in shadow. They reminded Harry of the tunnel leading to the Chamber of Secrets. *This place is probably about as dangerous.*

Regulus had warned him about the Black family library the first night of summer. *"It might be the country's largest collection of books on twisted magic."*

Most of his time here hadn't been spent reading any of the Blacks' books, but *The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.*

The book had divided public opinion. Rita Skeeter had droves of devoted readers who took everything she said as gospel. They were a raging mob, shouting for Dumbledore to relinquish his positions of power.

*"Do you think they'll get their way?"* Harry had asked Regulus over dinner.

Regulus just shook his head. *"Not a chance. Dumbledore has too much power and support. It would take something catastrophic for him to lose his positions unless the ministry or Wizengamot actively pushed for it."*

*"And neither of them are?"* Regulus shook his head again, chewing his steak. *"I would have thought people like Lord Malfoy would take the chance to try weakening Dumbledore's base of power."*

*"You're learning, but slowly."*

*"What do you mean?"*

*"Plenty of idiots believe everything Skeeter says, but plenty more have functional minds and think for themselves. Skeeter has spouted off too much nonsense over the years for people to believe all this. It's a start. If something else happens, Dumbledore would have a hard time fending off the masses. He might still give up a position for the sake of public appearances, but no more than that. People like Lucius will be hoping for something bigger to happen while Dumbledore is more vulnerable than he's ever been. That's when they'll pounce. Not over a book full of rumours."*

*If only people realized most of the rumours might actually be true.* Dumbledore really had been friends with Grindelwald. How far that had gone, he did not yet know, but there had been something there.

***July 20, 1899***

***The Dumbledore Family Home***

***6:22 PM***

"Believing any trail to them remains here is foolish."

Days had been spent together since that first dinner. The two of them had bonded from the moment his aunt mentioned the Deathly Hallows. Gellert's obsession had reignited with another believer onside, and they had talked of little else since.

Now they sat in Albus's living room and rehashed the old debate. It never ceased to frustrate Gellert. *Never have I met anyone so controlled by their own closed-mindedness.* A fire swirled inside his chest, purpose unlike anything he had ever known. *I must break these barriers --- for him and the world.*

"Why are you so insistent on this?" he asked. "This is the resting place of the most successful Peverell. Surely you do not mean to tell me you believe the tale's fancies about Death after all this time?"

"I've found the same sources and drawn the same conclusions you have about the Peverells."

"Then why would this not be the beginning? Ignotus once called this place home. The others might have for all we know. There must be traces."

"I have told you already that I've known of the Hallows for longer than you. I heard the story years ago."

"As did I."

"But I didn't wait. Patience has never been a virtue of mine. I searched everywhere I could. You don't think I've scoured Ignotus Peverell's grave? You don't think I've searched every corner of this infernal place?"

Gellert smirked. "Perhaps I just think I'm more gifted than you are and believe that I can do something that you could not."

"Then you're more arrogant than I took you for."

"What one man calls arrogance, another calls confidence. It has always served me well; I see my paths and speak them into being."

Albus's lips thinned. "I have never been fond of Divination."

"Why not? There are records that prove its power."

"A small number of records over thousands of years. My point isn't that Divination doesn't exist. My point is that so few have the gift that the subject is all but obsolete."

Gallery smirked again. "How shortsighted of you."

"I prefer to call it pragmatic."

Gellert laughed, a cold and wild sound that poured from his lips. *I never realized how rarely I laughed; the sound has changed since I was a boy.*

"Do you, Albus?"

Gellert's head snapped around. The voice came from the sitting room's entrance.

Standing at the threshold was a boy who looked remarkably like Albus; he had the same long face, auburn hair, and the same piercing blue eyes, but he was shorter and not quite so thin. A girl hung from his arm. Gellert thought for a moment that she was a partner, but then he looked closer and remembered her sitting beneath a canopy of dying leaves.

"Your siblings?"

"Yes. Aberforth, Ariana, this is Gellert Grindelwald. He is Bathilda's nephew and has become a dear friend of mine."

"That explains a lot," snarled Aberforth, scowling. "I've never seen you so neglectful."

The air grew frosty. *Neglectful? What nonsense is he speaking?*

"Aberforth, there is a time and a place---"

"That time is now. Look at her!" He turned the girl towards her older brother. *Frail is not the half of it; Albus understated.*

"Ariana, what's wrong?"

The girl trembled, tears welling in her eyes. Gellert watched as his friend deflated. *There is more here than I realized.*

*"Tell your aunt that I, at least, will attend. My sister is sick and I'm unsure whether she or my brother will make it."*

Gellert's pulse quickened, anger boiling beneath his skin. *Another wizard made a slave to lesser beings. When does it end?* Albus agreed about the muggles. Those talks always made him uneasy, but he agreed. *Why let them control him? He must know there's nothing he can do for her.*

Gellert formed tendrils of magic and reached out towards her. The gesture was small and subtle; just enough to brush her mind.

Flaming daggers descended inside his skull. A short breath escaped him and his hand drifted towards his wand. Albus must have noticed; he would attack at any moment.

Nothing came. The girl was looking at him with wide, fearful eyes. The boy beside her still stared at Albus. *Impossible; she's a child.* There was no other explanation. *A natural occlumens? How can she possess such skills but be so broken?*

"I'll leave." There was nothing to be done. Albus would see reason in his own time; he had to. "It was a pleasure meeting you both." He smiled at the youngest Dumbledore. "I hope your health improves, Ariana."

"You don't need to leave," said Albus. Gellert almost grinned at the look on his face. *Yes, he will learn soon; he resents it already.*

His stomach twisted. Thinking of Albus like he did others always made him feel sick. He was better than them --- the only person who ever made Gellert feel whole. *It will be better for him; you act for the greater good.*

"It's all right. I'm sure we'll talk soon."

"I'll owl you this evening; our discussion is unfinished."

Gellert threw a careless grin over his shoulder. "I look forward to your letter."

***Back in the present...***

*I'd ask him to speed the memories up if it wasn't letting him win.* Giving Grindelwald inches worried him. Giving him the chance to take a mile was almost unthinkable. But Merlin, he was curious. *How did they go from being so close, to the greatest duel of all time?*

Skeeter wrote about Grindelwald fleeing after Ariana's death, but he hoped that was untrue. If Grindelwald had been the one to kill her... that did odd things to his mind when he considered how similar they were, often surfacing another memory.

*"We're similar, you know. Both halfbloods, both orphans raised by muggles unfit to lick the hems of our robes. We were both sorted into Slytherin House and quickly became prodigies in our own right. We're probably the only two Parselmouths who have come through this school since the great Salazar Slytherin himself and we even look somewhat alike."*

*Shut up, Riddle! I'm nothing like you! I'm better --- I'll prove it!*

***Meanwhile, in Cairo, Egypt...***

"I dunno how you put up with it," Ron told Bill as the two of them trudged through a sea of sand that smouldered under a blistering sun. "That portkey was awful."

"International ones are never pleasant, but getting paid to take them helps."

"Guess it would, yeah," Ron grunted, wiping sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand.

Bill had greeted them an hour ago, waiting at their point of arrival. Having spent the past handful of years working here, he knew the land well and had taken time off work, sans a few low-risk expeditions he said would take little time.

Bill had been staring a hole right through him from the moment they'd arrived. *The hell did mum tell him?*

"Is it always this hot?" Ron asked.

Bill pushed sweat-soaked hair back from his eyes. "You lot chose the hottest time of the year to pay me a visit, but it's never exactly like back home."

"Somewhere in between would be nice."

"Funny how things usually don't end up that way. How have you enjoyed Hogwarts?"

That was a trap question if he'd ever heard one. *Blimey, Bill's the one I always got on well with.* "Snape's as big a git as any of you said, and Quidditch is great."

Bill snorted. "Youngest seeker in a century they've taken to calling you?"

Ron blushed. "They did in first year. The nickname died a bit when I lost to Potter."

"I heard about that too. Something about a cursed bludger?"

"It wouldn't leave him alone. Chased him no matter what he did. Fred and George have never let me live that down; the fact I lost to someone who was busy flying away from a bludger the whole game."

"Not your finest moment, no." Bill came to a stop and withdrew his wand, conjuring a blanket and taking a seat, gesturing for Ron to do the same. "We've been walking for almost an hour. It's best to rest in this heat."

"I'm fine," Ron defended, wiping more sweat from his face.

Bill gave him a hard look. "Poor choice of words."

"What---"

"You're a lot of things, but I doubt fine is one of them. Not after how your last two years at Hogwarts ended."

Ron's cheeks burned. "Have Mum and Dad---"

"No one's put me up to anything. If you must know, they did write to tell me what happened, but nothing more than that." He gave Ron a pointed look. "I first saw a friend die during an expedition *after* I graduated."

Ron sobered. "Sorry," he muttered. "I never knew that happened."

"Every cursebreaker sees it. We got too close to a violent ward; he was the closest." Bill removed two flasks of water from his bag, handing one to Ron and taking a deep pull from the other. "That day popped up in my dreams for months, and I wasn't eleven."

Ron hunched his shoulders. "That was more than a year ago. It was really hard, but I've had time."

Ron shifted beneath his brother's gaze. *Did I mess up?* "I was under the impression that Neville Longbottom fell down a flight of stairs."

Cold seeped through his veins despite the blazing sun. *I definitely messed up.* "What---"

"I said that I watched someone die and you implied you went through that same thing after his death."

"I didn't mean---"

"Didn't mean to tell me? No, I imagine not." Bill took another sip of water while Ron fussed with his robes, heart pounding against his ribs. "Since you've been bottling it up for a year, do you care to actually tell someone how Neville Longbottom died?"

"I didn't see it. Honest, I didn't."

"So you were proxy to it; it's close enough."

*Why does he have to be so bloody smart?* "I can't."

"Why not?" asked Bill, lying down on the blanket and peering up at Ron. "You know I'm not the type to run off and tell Mum or Dad."

Ron wrung his hands. "I promised Dumbledore I wouldn't say anything to anyone --- even my family."

"Did you now?" Bill asked with a frown. "Serious business, then. Is it at least safe to say what happened was no simple accident at school?"

Ron nodded. "It wasn't, no. I... wish it was."

Bill scowled. "Then you're a fool."

Ron's eyes widened. "What---"

"If it was no accident, then it meant something. Some stupid fall down a jinxed set of stairs is meaningless. It doesn't do the person justice. I don't know how Longbottom died, but your reactions tell me it had more purpose than that."

Ron swallowed a lump in his throat. "It... yeah, it did."

"There you go. What about Lovegood's?"

Ron blinked back hot tears. "I saw that one."

It was so close. Ron could feel the truth on his tongue. The moment was perfect, but something gave him pause. The last thing he wanted was for Bill to think him some sort of fool. *And that's if he doesn't think I'm a killer.*

"And that's the worst part for you?" He nodded. "There's no easy advice to help with this one. All I can say is that you'll work through it and that you should learn from it."

Ron swallowed hard again. "What do you mean learn from it?"

Bill shrugged. "It's hard to say without knowing more. I know that you were in the Chamber of Secrets with that supposed Heir of Slytherin. It must not have been a pleasant thing to see, but there was probably a lesson to be learned. Something that can be taken away from it that will make you better."

Another lump formed in Ron's throat. "I'll think about it," he rasped. "I just don't want to think about it all that much."

"Distractions are nice." Bill took his longest sip of water yet, but his eyes never left Ron. "Do you remember what you said when I first told the family I wanted to be a cursebreaker?" Ron shook his head. "You said that you were going to become one, too." Bill grinned. "If professional Quidditch didn't work out, of course."

Heat flooded his cheeks again. "It sounded cool."

"Does it still? Even after I've told you about colleagues stumbling to their deaths?"

"That doesn't make it any less cool. It just means it's more serious than I realized as a kid."

Bill chuckled. "You're still a kid whether you like it or not. You'll tell me I was right in two years, then again in another two, then again two years after that."

"Yeah, yeah, whatever. So, what were you saying about cursebreaking?"

"The sites I'll be off to whilst you lot are here have already been examined. It's simple work. Go in, take down some wards, and remove whatever they're protecting."

"So?"

"If you wanted the distraction and any of those expeditions landed on days the family wasn't doing anything interesting, I was going to offer to take you along."

Ron's jaw fell open. *Merlin...* "You'd take me?"

"So long as you promised to listen at all times and stay back until told otherwise."

His heart sank. "Mum would never---"

"I'm sure I can talk her around."

"Are you?"

"I am. You need it and she knows that."

The two boys sat in silence for a long time. "Thanks, Bill. I need all this."

***Malfoy Manor***

***1:07 PM***

It felt strange being back at Malfoy Manor. Nearly a month of summer had passed, but finally Harry's friends were all freed up from whatever had been keeping them busy.

Harry was the first to step from the fireplace and was fawned over by Narcissa until Pansy's arrival not long later. The dark-haired girl was practically vibrating with excitement as she chattered away at a hundred words per minute.

Crabbe and Goyle arrived just seconds apart, but the arranged meeting time came and went before Theodore finally stepped from the fire.

*He looks different.* His skin was a touch too pale. His eyes too looked wrong, too blank and guarded.

"Summer taking a lot out of you?" Harry asked, quietly enough so only Theodore would hear whilst they all walked outside.

"Just tired is all." Theodore fidgeted. *He doesn't look tired to me...*

"Quidditch?" Draco asked Harry, Crabbe, and Goyle. *Guess he figures the others won't be interested.*

Harry shot one last glance back at Theodore before agreeing. Theodore must not have expected it because his expression slipped. *Something really is wrong,* Harry thought as he mounted his Nimbus. *I've never seen him look so worried.*

***July 28, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***9:04 AM***

Theodore's expression plagued him those next few days --- mixed with his worries about Grindelwald and half a dozen other things. A string of beautiful days all dawned, bright and vibrant, but none of them washed his worries away.

Those worries were strong this morning, so Harry made his way down to the sitting room to eat breakfast with Regulus, who usually said something interesting to take his mind off things.

This morning, that thing was Quidditch. "I just don't really know anything about professional Quidditch," Harry admitted.

Regulus sipped his tea. "You enjoy the game, though?"

"Yeah."

"You'd love watching professional Quidditch."

"Probably. I've just never had the chance. I don't even know all the teams."

Regulus smirked. "You hardly need to know all the teams. Teams like the Chudley Cannons haven't been relevant in a century."

"Aren't Chudley the orange ones?"

"That's them." Regulus grinned. "See? You know more than you realize."

Harry shrugged. "Not really. Draco just mocked Ron Weasley loads for supporting them."

"Probably one of his better reasons for mocking someone." A shadow passed across Regulus's face. "Your father and his group of friends sometimes went around the halls loudly supporting Chudley for the sake of being contrarians." Regulus shook his head. "That and starting fights."

Harry laughed as Kreacher popped into the room with that morning's mail. Harry's laughter ceased the moment Regulus glanced down towards the *Prophet's* front page.

It was like all the blood vanished from his body for how quickly he paled. His hands trembled so badly he was forced to set down his cup of tea.

*That's not good.* "Regulus, what---"

"I'm sorry, Harry. I'll be in my study. Call for Kreacher if you need anything."

Never had Regulus dismissed him so soundly. It stung worse than expected, but he ignored it and reached for the paper while Regulus rushed off. *What the hell could make him react like that?*

A handsome face stared out at him with eyes so much like his brother's. Long black hair tumbled past his shoulders, grinning like he knew some secret no one else did.

***Malfoy Manor***

***8:44 PM***

It had been a strange day. Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban had rocked the nation and Regulus remained shut up in his study.

Harry knew who Sirius Black was but found himself feeling disconnected. He had never grown up fearing his name and could not make himself hate a man for killing a dozen muggles. *Maybe I am like Voldemort.*

*No!* he told himself. *There's nothing wrong with hating muggles; you're no Voldemort, you'll be better.*

The day grew stranger when an owl from Narcissa arrived that afternoon. Harry frowned as he read, something felt off. She wanted to meet with him that night. *Why does she sound so worried? It's like she's afraid something big will happen before we meet tonight.*

He was no less perplexed by the time he stepped through roaring green flames and into the Malfoys' opulent manor.

*CRACK!*

Harry's hand drifted towards his wand when he saw the familiar, filthy pillowcase, but he relaxed when he realized this was not Dobby.

"Master be here to see Mistress Narcissa?"

Harry nodded. "She told me to come and talk to her after I was done with everything for the day."

"I be taking you to her now."

They walked through a maze of winding halls that gave way to a large sitting room. Setting sunlight streamed through windows stretching from floor to ceiling, pooling around Narcissa as she paced back and forth. A nervous prick pierced Harry's confusion. *I've never seen her look nervous before.*

"I be bringing the young master to you, Mistress Narcissa."

Harry's nerves hardened when she spun a fraction too fast. *She's jumpy, too.* "I see that. Begone; ensure no one interrupts."

"Is everything all right?" Harry asked once the elf was gone.

"I wish I could tell you that it was."

*She sounds like she expects an explosion, or something.* "What's wrong? Does this have something to do with Sirius Black?"

It was like the fatigue of a long day caught up with her all at once. "Everything."

*Why is she so worried by Black? He's on the same side as her husband.* "What is it? I wouldn't have expected you to be so worried about him."

"It's not him I'm worried about, it's you."

Harry hesitated. *Me?* "How much of what we talked about in the hospital wing did Lord Malfoy tell you?"

"I am aware of the conversation. You know that Lucius faithfully serves the Dark Lord in whatever way he can."

Harry studied her. "He said that the Dark Lord doesn't want me to fear him."

"That's true as far as I know."

"Then why would I need to worry about Sirius Black? Everyone says he was the Dark Lord's lieutenant."

Narcissa twirled a lock of hair around her finger. "Everyone says plenty about situations they know nothing about." Her voice lowered.

"What is there to know? Black killed a wizard and a dozen muggles in broad daylight."

"So did most of the Dark Lord's followers. My own sister did worse before being sent to Azkaban."

"Your sister?"

"Bellatrix Lestrange."

"Oh, right. She was a Black."

Narcissa gazed back out the window. "She was."

"Wasn't she the one arrested for torturing the Longbottoms?" Harry had researched the Longbottoms after Neville's murder in his first year. The story had filled his nightmares until Grindelwald took them over.

"Along with her husband, his brother, and Barty Crouch's son, yes."

His pulse quickened. *She must be using Occlumency. No one looks that calm a few seconds after being so panicked. Merlin, what's going on?* "So what is it about Black that has you so worried if it isn't what he did?"

"Not to the muggles or to Peter Pettigrew." She lowered herself onto one of the couches, hands folded in her lap. "I think it's best if you sit." Harry sat with bated breath. Whatever made her speak so gently must not be good.

"I've told you that your father was part of an infamous group of delinquents whilst at Hogwarts."

Harry nodded slowly. "I remember."

"What I haven't told you was who his friends were."

Dread coiled in the pit of his stomach. "Black was a Gryffindor, wasn't he?" Narcissa nodded. "So Black was friends with my father?"

"Him and Peter Pettigrew, along with another boy named Remus Lupin." She appeared to chew her words. "The reason I didn't tell you is because Black's allegiances in the Purity War were more complicated than most would have you believe."

Harry tilted his head. *Complicated?* "They seem obvious."

"Black wasn't always loyal to the Dark Lord. He was driven from his parents' house as a teen and spent the next few years living with your father."

"So he joined Voldemort after school even though he was friends with my father?" There was something else. This was all new but meaningless. What did he care if his father once lived with a madman who may not yet have been mad?

"The first group Sirius joined was a vigilante organization run by Dumbledore. They were more effective in fighting the Dark Lord than the ministry for most of the war."

"What changed?" It was the only question left, but he dreaded the answer. What could have turned Black away from his best friend and into the open arms of Voldemort?

Narcissa wrung her hands. "No one knows. I'm sure the Dark Lord did before he attacked you, but it's not as though anyone has been able to ask him."

"So he just joined him?"

Narcissa's mask cracked. *Here we go...* "It wasn't that simple."

Harry scowled. *Get to the point.* "None of this seems to be simple."

"I know, but it's going to get worse."

"Just say it."

Narcissa closed her eyes. She looked like a porcelain statue as she pondered. "Have you ever heard of the Fidelius Charm?"

Harry opened his mouth to answer no, then remembered something Dumbledore had once told him.

*"It was much more complicated than that, but yes. It was first sent to Gringotts while I ensured certain protections were in place at the castle. Other things were considered, too. The Fidelius Charm was taken under strong consideration, but I dismissed it. Nicholas has participated in the charm's casting as many times as a person can and I confess, I wanted to save my available usages of it for a later date."*

"I've heard it mentioned. Something about available usages?"

"It's a very complicated spell. It involves two people --- the caster and the secret keeper. The caster casts the spell and it's bound to the secret keeper. Anything the spell is cast on will be hidden so completely that it's impossible to find."

Harry's suspicion rose. *That seems like it would have been a better protection for the stone.* "Why isn't that used all the time?"

"The available usages factor you mentioned plays a part."

"I don't actually know what it means. I just heard someone say it."

Narcissa toyed with her hair again. "It means that no one can be the caster or the secret keeper more than once."

"Wait, what?"

Narcissa shrugged. "The theory is beyond me. Very few witches or wizards have ever successfully cast it."

Harry hated that his first idea was to ask Grindelwald about the spell. He shivered. *Stay on-topic, this is more important right now.* "What about Black? What does this have to do with him?"

"Have you not guessed?" Harry shook his head. A pained look crossed Narcissa's face and unease slithered in his stomach. *This won't be good.* "Your parents went into hiding under the Fidelius Charm. Your mother was the caster and Sirius was the secret keeper."

Numb shock washed over him. It all made sense. Why Narcissa had been so worried, why she had wanted to be the one to tell him, and even why there was so little information about Sirius Black as a Death Eater. This meant...

Heat stirred beneath his skin. "So he betrayed my parents?"

"Yes."

Something was building in the pit of his stomach. Something hot and vile that threatened to burn straight through his flesh and spill out across the floor.

"Why?" was his only question.

"The only one who ever knew was the Dark Lord."

"This was why you wanted to tell me. Because you were afraid if I learned from someone else, I would think... something."

"I don't know what you're thinking now or what you would have thought, but this is a family matter. It should be handled with family, and it should be family who support you."

Harry ran a trembling hand through his hair. His Occlumency wavered. How he craved for the power to suppress his emotions.

"Is there anything else?"

"Are you all right?" Narcissa asked, moving closer.

*No! There's nothing worse than a traitor!* "I just... I need time to think."

"I think it's best if you're not alone."

"We can talk again, I just... is there anything else? I need to go."

"Harry---"

"Tell me!"

Narcissa pulled back. Guilt tried forming in his stomach --- he should never have yelled at her --- but the anger burned it to ash. It was winning, chipping at his defences brick by brick. Soon they would crumble and he would explode; he had to leave.

"Some people think that Black had personal reasons for betraying your father. It would explain why he went after Pettigrew and I've heard it said he would have killed you when he got to the house had Dumbledore's man not beaten him there."

Dumbledore's man had been Hagrid. Harry remembered the giant telling him how he had carried him across the sea the night his parents died.

Then it struck him what Narcissa was saying and he almost exploded right there. This was all too much. First Voldemort, then Grindelwald, and now this? It wasn't fair! None of this was fair! *When will everyone leave me alone?*

Tears stung the corners of his eyes. Every part of him trembled, rage seeping from every pore. "And now Black might come to try and finish the job, whether the Dark Lord wants him to or not."

"He will fail. We're here for you. Me, Lucius, Regulus, Diana, Draco, all of us. No one is going to hurt you --- no matter how hard they try." The tears were no longer silent. It was overwhelming.

He almost leapt from his skin when he felt her touch him. Harry leant back, but Narcissa was faster. She snaked her arms around his back and held him close. He stilled, shivering when cool fingers stroked his hair.

*It's too much.* The shaking worsened as weakness crept through him. His body collapsed and he buried his head in her shoulder, wracked by furious tears.

***July 30, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***The Library***

***2:33 PM***

It had been a long two days.

Harry had not returned home that night, instead sleeping at Malfoy Manor in the room he had occupied the previous summer.

The dreams had been awful.

Dreams of waking to that face looming over him, smiling the way it had in the *Daily Prophet's* photograph before everything vanished in a flash of green light.

Black had consumed his thoughts that next day; angry thoughts that boiled his blood and sent raging shivers up his spine.

*Why?* he'd thought. *I don't get this mad when thinking about Voldemort. Why does Black bother me so much worse?*

Both had played their parts in killing his parents, and both together had doomed him to a decade of hell on Privet Drive. The differences in how he felt about each of them confused him for a time, but it began making sense the longer he pondered.

Voldemort had acted to preserve himself. Harry's existence had been a threat to his own. *I can understand that.* What would he have done had he held the power to kill the Heir of Slytherin when his life was so threatened down in the Chamber of Secrets? *I can't blame him for being paranoid.*

Black's crimes felt more personal. *He betrayed them; he was their friend and he betrayed them.* The thought made him sick. How many times had Harry been betrayed? The Dursleys, Gemma, Draco, Daphne, the list went on and on. Each betrayal cut deep and left scars harsher than the ones carved by his parents' death. *I'll never forgive a traitor.*

Duelling lessons had resumed with Lord Corban Yaxley and he was improving fast. *Not fast enough --- I need to be ready when he comes for me.*

He looked around the library, considering the shadowed shelves with a frown. "*It might be the country's largest collection of books on twisted magic."*

*CRACK!*

Harry's head whipped up as violent fancies faded. "Kreacher?"

"There's a letter, master."

Harry leapt from his seat when he saw the bright orange envelope. Something so lurid could only have come from one man.

*Good day, Harry,*

*I'm afraid I've been quite inundated by letters these past few weeks, so I must apologize for the tardiness of my reply.*

*I will not claim my youth was savoury, nor even shout of blasphemy from the rooftops. Miss Skeeter's book is well-researched, just know that some things have been dressed up for public consumption.*

*Ariana's death was a tragic accident born at the end of a strife-filled summer. I wish Miss Skeeter would have let the dead rest --- there is no honour involving them in politics like this --- but there is certainly some truth in what she writes.*

*Thank you for your concern and I look forward to seeing you back at Hogwarts.*

*Kindest regards,*

*Albus Dumbledore*

*So it's true --- all of it is true.* Dumbledore meant to avoid the question, but he had given enough. *I can't blame him. It's not like he realizes I've already seen the start of that summer and can put the rest together.*

He closed his eyes but opened them the moment Sirius Black's face swam before his vision. *Damn him! I need a distraction!*

A tragic accident, Dumbledore had said? What sort of tragic accident could kill his sister and end a friendship he had once cherished? It was true, then --- it had to be; there was nothing else that explained everything so succinctly.

Grindelwald's pendant felt heavy against his skin, its metal cooler than usual. Or maybe that was just the cold that crept through him any time he considered leaning more on Grindelwald. If there were any doubts the memories were fakes, this disproved them, but giving the once dark lord an inch still unnerved him.

High, cold laughter filled his thoughts. His grip on the letter became vice-like as he closed his eyes. *Grindelwald might not have driven me mad, but thinking about Black for long enough will.*

"I did not expect you."

Harry opened his eyes and stared unblinkingly at Grindelwald. "I want another memory."

Grindelwald studied him. "Another memory?"

"Yes." He hesitated. "There's been a book published. It's about Dumbledore and it talks about what happened that summer."

"And you wish to know whether what it says is true?" Looking at Grindelwald suddenly became much harder, so Harry stared past him and out over the waters of Lake Königssee far below. "I must arrange flowers for the author if her work is what has piqued your interest."

Harry scowled. *Dumbledore is right; she should have left things alone.* "She's probably drowning in them already. Dumbledore has a lot of enemies and people are talking."

"I'm sure it means little to them compared to what it means to me. Their squabbles are petty, your interest might change the world. It is precious beyond anything they will ever own."

The room faded.

***August 4, 1899***

***The Dumbledore Family Home***

***3:21 PM***

Albus watched him for any sign of doubt as he so often did, but he would find none. "You truly mean to do everything you say? To unite the Hallows and then the world under a single banner."

Gellert trembled, excitement coursing through him. "Under the banner of those fit to rule. You have said it yourself. We are ruled by creatures who are made inferior."

"And you understand how difficult that will be?"

*Of course it will be difficult. There would be no need if it was easy.* "Of course it will be difficult, but you know my plans."

Albus gazed out the window. "You can't believe that old tale."

Gellert scoffed. "I think we've both made it clear that we believe the tale."

"But to believe possession of all three Hallows makes one---"

"The Master of Death? No, we both understand how foolish that is."

"Then what---"

*Why does he play these games? He understands this all himself.* "It is not about becoming the Master of Death. Think. Think what we could do with the Death Stick under our command, or with a stone powerful enough to raise armies of the dead."

"It would take decades if it was possible at all."

"Alone, perhaps."

"We've been over this before. You know I can't---"

"Then don't."

Albus blinked. "I beg your pardon?"

"You cannot leave your sister behind because she is too broken by what those muggles did to her." It had been days after first seeing Ariana when Albus explained the truth. All it did was make him surer that Albus would join him. *He must crave it just as deeply --- anything else is impossible.*

"You are correct."

"Then don't. Take her with you. She will be safer with us."

Albus laughed without mirth. "Safer whilst we oppose everything those with power believe in?"

Gellert sneered. "I scoff at their power. Political prestige will mean nothing when the systems that value it are torn to the ground. Magical prowess will mean nothing against us. We are better and you know it; the two most gifted sorcerers in the world. One of us will control the Death Stick whilst the other leads an army of the dead. No amount of might will save them then!"

A faraway look crossed Albus's face. "The cloak."

Gellert frowned. *What?* "What of it?"

"The cloak never fit into our plans."

"Why would it? It grants an ability we already have."

"An ability my sister lacks."

Gellert's chest swelled with glee. "Yes! That's it! See? You have no reason to turn down fate. We are destined to rule; everything fits so smoothly in place."

"Does it?"

Albus leapt from his chair. "Aberforth! What have I told you about entering uninvited?"

The foolish boy glared. "You want to lecture me, Albus? You talk of neglecting Ariana and you want to lecture me?"

"When did I ever---"

"Who would care for her whilst you two chased fame and glory? What would happen when she had an episode? Would the cloak hide her from her own disease?" Gellert clenched the arms of his chair so tight that his knuckles paled. *Fame and glory? Does the boy understand nothing? There would be no need to hide --- his sister would have justice!* "Admit it, Albus! You can't answer."

"There is no question to answer!" Gellert raged. "Think before you speak, boy. Think before you accuse---"

"Gellert, no!"

He glanced to his left and saw that Albus was tense and glaring. His stomach writhed. *How dare he choose that fool!* "Fine. I will leave you to quarrel with this lackwit yourself. Good day, Albus."

"Gellert! Wait!" Gellert had already left the kitchen and was most of the way to the door. He strode from the house without a backwards glance, pausing only when he saw her sitting cross-legged on the front lawn.

She looked up at him but shrank back from his glare, teary-eyed. *How is she so weak? How could such pathetic creatures break her so easily? They tested me and I grew stronger. She's gone through so much less and is frailer than a child.*

***July 31, 1993***

***Malfoy Manor***

***8:36 PM***

Grindelwald's memory had not provided the distraction Harry had hoped for. No longer did he obsess over Black and how he could work towards his destruction, but he was consumed by a new question. *Is it more dangerous to want Black dead, or to sympathize with Grindelwald?*

Harry walked the lawns of Black Manor the morning of his thirteenth birthday, hoping the fresh air and bright sunrise would lift his mood. It helped some, but he was aided more by Regulus, who was waiting for him in the dining room by the time he came back inside. The Lord Black had hidden away since his brother's escape from Azkaban, but today he was all smiles. *It's almost like it never happened.*

The day and its festivities did a better job still at taking his mind off things. A heaping breakfast greeted Harry and his friends at Malfoy Manor, followed by an afternoon out on the grounds playing Quidditch, chasing each other around the lake, and finally lounging near the water's edge.

The water had darkened and become split by a line of fading sunlight by the time they were summoned inside for dinner, joined now by the respective parents and their partners.

The feast left Harry full and sluggish, but presents stirred him just moments later. Books and trinkets dominated the haul, but all that changed when he opened the Malfoys' gift.

"The World Cup?" he asked, his heart fluttering.

"Britain is hosting next summer," Lucius explained. "These were devilishly hard to get ahold of, but I thought you might enjoy attending. I purchased tickets for us as well," he gestured to himself, his wife, and his children.

Harry grinned, glancing at Regulus, who looked a fraction too pleased. *I bet that talk about professional Quidditch was him gauging my interest for Lucius.*

The final gift was from Regulus and it was no chain this year; the box was much too large.

"Open it, then," said Regulus.

Draco gasped aloud when something red and gold rolled out. A second passed during which Harry wondered whether Regulus had pranked him with a Gryffindor-themed gift, but then he saw it.

"What is this?" he asked, running his fingers along the smooth, polished surface of a racing broom with red-coloured twigs. All he knew was the name, printed on the handle in golden letters.

"State-of-the-art racing broom," Regulus said with a grin. *I've never seen him look so happy*. "Some of the top World Cup teams will be using these next year. They're supposed to be miles ahead of any Nimbus and aren't technically in stock yet. Getting ahold of this one was a nightmare."

*Merlin...* "How much did this cost?"

Regulus waved a hand. "I was a seeker. No one is willing to spend more money on a broom than a seeker."

One awkward hug later, he found himself reacquainted with his friends' parents. *Thank Merlin for that portrait's lessons. They must have thought I was an idiot last summer.*

He finally extricated himself and slipped from the room, making for the nearest balcony. *I need some air.*

"Harry!"

Harry's hand drifted towards his wand. He might have jumped had he not recognized the voice. "Draco?"

"Something's wrong."

Harry's eyes narrowed. *I'm too stressed for this right now.* "What do you mean?"

The blond began fidgeting. "Father... he keeps looking at you. I don't know, it's just wrong."

*What is he on about?* "Looking at me?"

Draco wrung his hands. "Yes! It's like... I don't know. It just... I don't know. Something's not right."

Harry's heart fluttered. "What's his expression like? What makes it look wrong?"

"I don't know! He looks exhausted every time and my mother just left about ten minutes ago. They were whispering together when she stormed out. She didn't look pleased. Something's going to happen, but I don't know what."

Harry shifted from foot to foot, his hands on his wand. "What could happen? It's a birthday party."

"I don't know, just... Harry. I'm scared."

"I beg your pardon, masters." The squeaking voice made Draco jump and draw his wand, but it was only a house elf.

"What?" snapped Draco.

"It be Mistress Narcissa, sirs. She wants to see the young master." The elf bobbed its head at Harry. *It looks nervous, too.*

Harry looked from Draco to the elf. Could this be another betrayal? Had Lucius planned this whole thing with his son? *I don't think so. I believe him; he's never been good at hiding things.* Which meant that if Lucius and Narcissa had argued, this summons may be against Lucius's will. *I trust Narcissa more than him. She might be leading me away from whatever trap her husband set.*

"Where is she?" Harry asked.

"I be showing master if he follows me, sir."

Draco grabbed his arm once the elf moved away. "Be careful!"

Harry faked a smile. "Always."

Harry was led down the familiar path of corridors leading to the same room he had met Narcissa in earlier in the week. His nerves calmed some when they reached the room's entrance, but his head had begun aching.

"S-she be inside m-m-master." *What is it with the Malfoys' elves being so nervous about everything?*

Black curtains were drawn across the windows Narcissa had paced near the last time Harry was here. There were no torches or candles; the room was so dark that Harry could barely see the sofa. *This headache isn't helping anything. Merlin, it's getting bad.*

"Narcissa?" he asked as the pain swelled. He shook his head but no relief came, nor did it grow worse. Harry closed his eyes against the pain... the pain that came exclusively from his scar. Oh... *fuck!*

"I'm afraid she won't be joining us."

He clasped his hand over his scar as it exploded with pain. Suddenly he could see better and his head loomed higher, watching the boy shrink back. *Strange. Does my presence pain him?*

Harry forced his mind clear and the pain receded some. He removed a shaking hand and raised his eyes, staring across the room.

A pair of red eyes fractured the darkness, illuminating a chalk-white face that began moving closer...

**Harry Potter and the Perversion of Purity**

**Book 3: The Looming of Shadows**

**Chapter 4: Face to Face**

***July 31, 1993***

***Malfoy Manor***

***9:03 PM***

Harry drew his wand but knew it was hopeless. Days had been spent lamenting how he was not yet ready to face Sirius Black, and Voldemort was an entirely different monster.

The Dark Lord chuckled. "Do you mean to kill me, Harry?"

"You killed my parents." He was surprised how calm his voice sounded. "Why shouldn't I?"

"Such childish words, should and shouldn't. Who is to say what you should and shouldn't do? The Ministry of Magic, the most corrupt magical organisation in the country? Is that who you defer to in times like this?"

Harry took a deep breath. "You don't always need to be told---"

"You never need to be told. Not those of us with power. Should and shouldn't, right and wrong; they are cut from the same cloth of lies. Why *should* someone with power bend to the whims of those who are weak? Why *should* they not do what is best for them and instead do what they're told?"

The pain in his scar was still blinding. Harry clamped down harder on his emotions and the pain receded, still present but less violent. It was like he had unblocked a river; his mind was moving again. *Not that it's helping. How can I answer a question I've asked myself before?*

"Lucius Malfoy told me I have no reason to fear you."

"And what do you think?" Voldemort asked, his voice soft and quiet.

*I can hardly think at all.* "It doesn't make any sense."

Harry heard Voldemort move but could still see nothing. *Enough of this; if I'm going to die, it won't be in the dark.* He lit his wand, shocked and horrified by the sight before him. Scarlet eyes stared out from a chalk-white face, bald and noseless. *It's like he's half man, half snake.*

Voldemort spread his hands; skeletal things with long, pale fingers that were like spider legs made only from bone. "Do you see what you have accomplished, Harry?"

"A-accomplished?"

"I have conquered death, yet my defeat still haunts me. This body reminds me every day of what happened that night."

Every nerve screamed for him to run, but he held his ground. Fleeing would result in nothing but death; surely Voldemort would never take that chance. "So why are you talking instead of killing me?"

Voldemort spread his hands. "Magical blood is precious, every spilled drop is a tragedy."

Harry forced down the urge to scowl. "That's never stopped you before. Why should it now?"

"Is that what they've told you?" Voldemort's voice remained quiet but he might as well have shouted for how hard his words hit home. *It's like what Grindelwald said the first time we met. The* Dark Lord looked angry for the first time as he stood, waiting. "Answer me."

"I don't---"

"Is that how they label me? A tyrant who killed for sport and pleasure?"

*He wants the answer, and something tells me lying would be a bad idea.* "Sort of," he admitted.

"Explain," the Dark Lord demanded.

Harry forced himself not to muss his hair. "People's stories are different. No one seems to say the same thing, but most people think that. They say you wanted to kill anyone who wasn't a pureblood."

"Do they now?" Voldemort moved towards the window, pacing back and forth. Harry watched his every step and realized that Voldemort wasn't even looking at him. "Do you remember what I told you the night we met at Hogwarts?"

*How could I forget? That's the night that started everything, the night I started thinking for myself.* "You talked about muggles and how they fear what they don't understand. You mentioned that they were dangerous and that the Statute of Secrecy would fall. You've said it's come close before."

The words were like chalk on his tongue. They had kept him up for days back then, but he had ignored them. Now it was impossible. *How can I ignore them after what I've seen?* A broken girl lay in a pool of snow and blood, disfigured past recognition. Flames crawled up dry wood, licking at the hem of dark robes as a crowd of muggles cried for blood. *He's right --- everything he said about them was right.*

Bile rose in his throat. Why was the world so broken? Why did it make him agree with men like this? Harry wanted it all to go away. Voldemort, Grindelwald, all of it...

*Do you?* a small voice asked. *Do you really want them gone? Look what they're making you.*

"Muggles," hissed Voldemort. "The operative word is muggles. Where in what I told you did I mention the purity of blood?" Harry opened his mouth, but closed it. "Speak your mind," Voldemort commanded. "Now is the time to ask your questions. I will strike you down for none of them."

Wariness remained, but he decided to ask anyway. *Not that I have much choice.* *Sod it, Grindelwald surprised me, maybe he will, too.* "Tell me the truth, then?"

Voldemort ceased his pacing and turned his crimson stare on Harry. "The truth?"

"You seemed upset over what I'd heard about you and the war. Tell me the truth. What should I know? Convince me."

Voldemort's misshapen lips curved into something Harry thought was supposed to be a smile. "I have told you already what I want."

"Tell me more clearly." It was a mark of how far Harry's Occlumency had come that he was able to speak like this. *One wrong word might mean death.*

Voldemort considered him. "I wish to eliminate muggles and the threat they pose. That has always been my goal."

Harry's heart raced, but his voice stayed level. "What about your followers? Most of them were famous blood supremacists."

"What of them?" asked Voldemort.

*He sounds so casual.* "You say that you don't care about blood supremacy, but then you keep them around."

"Why should their opinions matter to me? All I care about is how well they serve. Those witches and wizards pledged themselves to me. I don't track every step they take because I have nothing to fear from them. If the job is done and done well, why should it matter if they go the extra mile?"

*This doesn't add up. Everything I've read says he's a tyrant. At least some people argue Grindelwald meant well.* "What about people like my father?" Harry asked, scrambling for anything to throw at Voldemort. "He was a pureblood and you killed him."

"I did." Voldemort's voice was calm and casual. *Should it bother me how easily he talks about killing them?* Harry had never known their faces back on Privet Drive. *Am I a monster because I don't cry for people I never knew?*

"Why?" he asked, unsure what else to ask.

"They opposed me. There was no malice, only purpose."

*I still think of Privet Drive anytime I look at him, but I can't hate that answer.* How could he hate someone for trying to survive? Harry wondered what he would have done in Voldemort's place, but thinking about it made his skin crawl. "So you only killed them because it helped your cause?"

"Yes."

"And you would do it again, wouldn't you?"

"Of course."

"Then why am I different?"

"Why would you not be?"

"I know about the prophecy." Voldemort's expression remained unchanged. "It said that a child born as the seventh month died would be the one to vanquish you. Dumbledore says you thought it was me, which is why you killed my parents and then attacked me."

Voldemort spread his hands. "And I was right, was I not? You were born as the seventh month died, and just as the prophecy foretold, you vanquished me. That is the end of it; the prophecy has been fulfilled and we are free of its bindings."

Harry's mind blanked. "We're... what?"

"Vanquished, not destroyed. My powers were shattered by magic I never considered. I was weaker than a ghost, scarcely a shadow drifting through distant lands. Does that not sound like I was vanquished? Did the prophecy not already come true?"

"Dumbledore made it sound---"

"Like there was more? Like it was your duty to throw yourself between him and I?" Harry said nothing. "Dumbledore has always been content letting others die. Grindelwald broke Europe while he sat comfortably in an office and marked my essays. I rose up years later and challenged everything he stood for, yet he never fought me. His servants died, but did he ever lift a finger?" Voldemort smiled again --- an image of cruelty that chilled Harry to the bone. "Why would Dumbledore fight now when he has the perfect pawn? One who has already taken a king off the board?"

*That's impossible, Dumbledore would never use me like that...*

*He did leave you with the Dursleys,* a dark voice whispered. *Even now he's admitted that he's not telling you everything. Why not? Does he not trust you, or does he not trust what you would do if he told you?*

*"The Malfoys might view you as a tool, but that doesn't mean all of us do."*

*I won't be used again, not unless I'm getting something out of it.*

"So you still want me to join you?" asked Harry. Thinking of that was easier than contemplating his own paranoia.

Voldemort smiled. "I want it more now than ever."

Harry forced himself to remain calm and ignore the blood rushing in his ears. "Why should I believe you? Why should I believe that it isn't just some plan to kill me?"

Amusement danced in Voldemort's eyes. "Think, Potter. We have been alone in this room with you at my mercy. If I wanted to kill you, you would be dead."

"My mother's sacrifice---"

"Is not all-powerful. There are always ways. I cannot touch you --- fine. I doubt that blessing would stop me from conjuring a storm of fire and burning you alive."

*Stop using logic that I can't just disprove.* "What about you manipulating me? How can I trust you're not doing that?"

Voldemort smiled. "That's better. I have no use for fools." He spread his skeletal arms again. "Ask anything of me and you will have it, so long as it doesn't weaken myself or my cause."

Harry's mind blanked. *He can't be serious.* He cleared his mind at top speed. "So you're bribing me to join you?"

"I am offering you a compromise and giving you a reason to take it. I'm not demanding your loyalty, I am asking for a chance to earn it." *That has to be a lie; Voldemort would never want to earn anything he could just take.* "We want the same things. You will see that soon."

*This sounds too good to be true.* "What if I refuse? What if I run back to Black Manor and write a letter to Dumbledore?"

"Then you die and waste the opportunity of a lifetime." His red eyes gleamed. "There are things I can give you that no one else can, not even Dumbledore."

Harry felt like his breath had frozen solid. Muscles ached each time he breathed. Could he do this? *There's no way he'll just let me take the offer and* *hang around forever. He'll demand my loyalty eventually. How long will he give me?*

He thought of his parents again and what they would think. He imagined their disappointed faces and expected to feel sadness. Instead he felt rage. *If they were worth anything, they'd want the best for me. But is this best? The risk is so high...*

A broken corpse lay in reddening snow, surrounded by discarded rocks and screaming mobs. Wood snapped beneath his feet as white-hot flames licked at the hems of his robes. The world faded, lost to the unimaginable pain of the Cruciatus Curse. A cupboard door slammed and darkness swallowed him, bitterness clawing at his chest.

That was when he decided. *The risk is worth it --- anything to never feel helpless again.*

***August 3, 1993***

***Egypt***

***1:48 PM***

Ron had expected it to be cooler underground, but it was just a different kind of heat. His skin no longer burned, but the air was so thick and stuffy that it was difficult to breathe.

"We're getting closer," said a tall man with dark skin and long black hair.

Bill had kept his word and convinced their mother to let Ron go with him on this job. Ron had half-expected that her mind would change, up until the moment he portkeyed away with Bill. *I still don't know how Bill convinced her.*

They had met up with the others and taken a flying carpet to their excavation site. Ron had never been on a flying carpet and remembered his father complaining that they were illegal back home. *Doesn't beat a broom, but I'd buy one if I could.* A sea of sand spread out beneath them, dotted with small towns and scarce mirages that were there for a heartbeat, then gone.

Bill had rolled up the carpet and shoved it into the bag slung over his shoulder when they'd landed. "Can't you just shrink it down?" Ron had asked.

"No," said Bill. "Altering its properties like that would disturb the runic array. We wouldn't be taking it back with us if I did that."

*I didn't even know what that meant a few weeks ago.* Percy asked Bill runic questions often and Ron had taken to listening in. Most of it was beyond him, but he had gathered some basics. *Wonder what Hermione would say if she knew I was going out of my way to learn stuff.* His bubble of pride popped when he remembered the electives he'd chosen. *Stupid, stupid!*

"It's darker than hell down here," Ron complained in a whisper, squinting through the black void ahead. One of the cursebreakers' wands was lit, but Ron hardly noticed.

"That's typical," Bill explained. "One of the most common wards we deal with is one that blocks light. It's a nightmare to cast, but the Egyptians were *good*."

"Couldn't you, like, I don't know, break it?"

One of Bill's colleagues laughed. Another --- a quiet, older man --- was more serious. "It's not worth the risk. If it's tied into a larger scheme, we could trigger much nastier traps."

"Left or right?" one of the men asked when they came to two branching paths. Sand made up the floor while rough stone of the same colour comprised the walls and ceiling.

"Left," said the man who'd assured them they were getting close. How he knew any of that as they sloped further down into the darkness, Ron knew not.

***August 7, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***10:32 AM***

Harry could hear his robes flapping in the wind as he soared in a great circle around Black Manor. He swerved hard to avoid Regulus, who had been flying the same circle but in the opposite direction.

Harry righted the broom; he had swerved too hard and flown off course. *I thought my Nimbus was responsive. It's like this thing reads my thoughts.*

Regulus signalled for them to land, so they swooped down, touching down just feet from the manor's front door. Both ran hands through windswept hair and grinned.

Few grins had crossed his face these past few days, so lost he was in troubled thoughts. Voldemort's red eyes and pale skin haunted his nightmares, whilst Harry dwelled on that final choice and how it made him feel in his waking moments.

*Not enough... I should feel more, more than just worry it will backfire.* Maybe Grindelwald's visions had done more than he realized. *I still don't want them to stop... oh, Merlin, what's happened to me?*

"What are you thinking?" Regulus asked once the pair stepped inside. Harry made a face; the inner conflict must have shown in his expression.

*If he wants to know, then fine.* "Did you know?"

Regulus frowned. "Know what?"

"Did you know that Voldemort planned to trap me alone on my birthday?"

Regulus paled, but his expression remained calm. "No."

Harry wrung his hands. "You serve him, don't you?"

Regulus stared past Harry and out the nearest window, a far-away look in his dark grey eyes. "I think you knew that already."

*I want to believe him... everything he's ever said seems so honest.* Black Manor was the first home he'd ever known outside of Hogwarts. *I just want this to work out.*

Harry shrugged as casually as he could. "I wanted to see how you answered."

"Clever. If I lied about one, then I lied about the other." Harry nodded. "May I ask whether the Dark Lord asked for your loyalty?"

Harry met his eyes, his stare unblinking. "You swear you didn't know?"

Regulus stared right back. "I swear it."

**Book 3: The Looming of Shadows**

**Chapter 5: Daunting Paths**

***August 6, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***9:33 PM***

Wind rattled the windows, raindrops pounding against the glass. Thunder boomed and Harry looked up from his book. Towering shelves cast long shadows that crawled through pools of flickering torchlight. He had once mistaken those shadows for movements in the corner of his eye, but he had grown used to them.

Until tonight, when all the old ticks returned.

Harry looked out the window to take his mind off things. He could see nothing through heavy sheets of rain but for the tops of distant trees.

He glanced down at his book but grimaced at the first spell. He had stayed away from the more gruesome tomes for over a month, but Voldemort's return changed everything. *I have to be ready. It's the only way I'll ever be free; the only way I won't always be afraid.*

Harry had done well that night and really did believe that Voldemort had no plans of killing him, but he knew that plans could change. The longer he pondered, the clearer his path became. His heart raced just thinking about it --- a long, treacherous path cloaked in death and shadows.

*It's not like I have better options. I could go to Dumbledore, but what would it get me?* House points and less time, he guessed. Would the headmaster still take time to teach him while busy combatting Voldemort? And if he did tell, Voldemort would know... *I hate feeling trapped. I hate being afraid.*

Harry's choices were two pits of vipers, but at least one offered prizes for taking the plunge.

He glanced back down at his book, steeling his nerves.

*Ossio Exploso*

Harry looked from the spell to its diagram, face unchanged by the shifting images of exploding blood and gore. *It doesn't bother me like it would have before.* Harry thought back to a cold, winter's day, stood atop a mountain overlooking Lake Königssee. Gone were the fear and worries about sliding down a slippery slope. All that remained was anger and an iron purpose. *I never want to be like her... I'll never feel helpless again.*

***August 13, 1993***

***Egypt***

***5:57 PM***

Ron looked around one last time. A small village lay behind him, whilst in front, the sand appeared to stretch on forever, covered in long shadows as the sun began setting. A hot breeze blew, kicking up sand that broke against his cloak.

Ron wouldn't miss the sand. It got everywhere and was impossible to clean without magic, but it and the heat were the only things he looked forward to leaving behind.

This trip had been the happiest he'd been since Neville's death. People like Cedric had tried to help, but Bill had done more in three weeks than any of them had in more than a year. Ron found talking with Bill easy. Bill listened and never treated him as if he were made of glass. *I'm gonna miss him.*

A hand landed on his shoulder and he looked up. "You don't look thrilled to leave," said Bill.

Ron swallowed a lump in his throat. "I'd have liked to go on another job or two."

Bill smiled. "Those don't come around all that often, not ones like the last. Most of them would be too dangerous to take you on."

Ron wrung his hands. "But I actually learned stuff this trip --- important stuff, stuff that'll actually help me."

"Study," Bill told him.

Ron grimaced. "It's not the same. I like doing things, not reading about them. I'm good with that sort of stuff and it feels like I was just getting the hang of runes."

Bill raised an eyebrow. "You know you could take them at Hogwarts?"

Self-loathing gnawed at him as he looked down towards the sand. "I can't. We picked our courses ages ago and I chose Care of Magical Creatures and bloody Divination. I just wanted easy classes, I never thought of how useful stuff like runes is."

"You can always ask McGonagall if she can change your timetable."

Ron looked up. "I can?"

Bill let out a long sigh. "She's your Head of House; things like this are exactly what she's there for."

Ron had never thought of it like that. McGonagall had always just been their Transfiguration Professor. *Guess she just doesn't feel like our Head of House compared to Snape running around and giving Slytherins points for breathing.*

"What about Arithmancy? Should I take that, too?"

Bill pursed his lips. "Why do you want to take Ancient Runes?"

Ron scratched his head. "Well, they're dead useful, aren't they?"

"A lot of things are useful. What about their use appeals to you?"

Ron wiped sweat from his forehead. "Wards are important, and you said runes can be used in duels, right?"

"It's an unusual approach, but I've seen it done."

"There you go. I want to take care of myself." His eyes fell back towards the sand. "I want to take care of my friends."

Bill squeezed his shoulder. "Then stick with runes. There's plenty of use for Arithmancy, but it's not the weapon of men who want to fight."

"Ron, hurry!" called his mother, beckoning for him to come back over to where the others gathered around a weathered old saddle.

"Go," said Bill. "Just remember you can write. I'll try and make sure I reply whenever I can."

Ron hugged him before walking off towards the rest of his family, jumping when a hand landed on each of his shoulders.

"Ancient Runes, Ronikins?" Fred asked in a low voice just before they reached their mother.

***August 14, 1993***

***Diagon Alley***

***12:04 PM***

Harry stepped through emerald flames and into a dimly-lit room. A well-dressed waiter rushed over. "Welcome, sir, we..." he trailed off, eyes lingering on Harry's forehead.

*Why does everyone stare? It's just a scar.* "I should be under a reservation made by Lord Lucius Malfoy," he said, ignoring the man's stare.

The waiter swallowed. "Right this way, sir."

Draco and Diana were already waiting for him, as were Crabbe, Goyle, and Cassie. Theodore, Cassius, and Pansy had yet to arrive.

"Pass along my thanks to your father," Harry told Draco when he sat down between Diana and Cassie. Draco smiled, but there was no hint of his usual smugness. *Weird. His father probably spent a fortune on this place, I was sure he'd be insufferable.*

Theodore arrived next. Harry watched him closely. *His smiles look strained.* The Notts were notorious blood supremacists and close with the Malfoys. *Is it Voldemort? Is that why he looks so awful?* Harry shuddered at the thought. Surely Theodore's father would keep him away from all of that.

His eyes flicked towards Cassie. She was the oldest in the room, plus the best duellist. *If anyone in our group's gonna be involved, it's her.* The Yaxleys had never been linked to Voldemort, but that meant little, especially when most of Lord Yaxley's friends had been.

Cassius entered, calm as still water. Pansy too looked normal, if a bit flushed.

"I never thought I'd meet anyone less punctual than Cassius," Diana said when Pansy arrived.

Her nostrils flared. "I was being lectured by my parents."

Theodore smirked; it was the most normal he had looked all summer. "That sounds like a convenient way of saying that makeup took longer than you expected."

Pansy rounded on Cassius. "How long were you here before me?"

He shrugged. "About five minutes."

"See? That's not that bad. What was your excuse?"

Cassius grinned. "Flying."

"Flying?" Pansy asked, whirling back to Diana and Theodore. "You have the nerve to give me grief after his excuse was flying?"

"Flying is a perfectly good reason to be late," Draco said with the hint of a smile, turning his grey-eyed stare on Harry. "Don't you agree?"

"Completely."

Pansy huffed. "You're all menaces. No one's safe from the lot of you."

*Oh, Pansy...* His eyes went from the Malfoy siblings to Theodore, and then to Cassie. *You have no idea how right you might be...*

***Hours later, in Knockturn Alley...***

The day was spent shopping and gossiping.

*"Father thinks it's different than last year,"* Draco had said when asked about their next Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor. *"He doesn't think Dumbledore's playing any games at all; he really does think no one wants the job."*

*"Can you blame them?"* Pansy had asked. *"No one's made it the full year since the late sixties."*

*"Skeeter didn't help anything,"* Diana added. *"She brought even more attention to the curse last year, and I bet her book on Dumbledore hasn't helped."*

*"They say he's going to resign as Chief Warlock tomorrow,"* said Theodore.

*"Do you really think any of it's true?"* Pansy asked. Harry forced down a lump of cold. *More than you know.*

Diana nodded. *"Some of it must be. The details are too fleshed out for them all to be fake, but it's Skeeter, so I'm sure plenty of it is nonsense."*

*"Do you think he was really friends with Grindelwald?"*

Harry schooled his features. He alone knew the truth but would say nothing. Those were questions he wanted no part of.

*"It wouldn't surprise me,"* said Cassie. *"Gifted people connecting is pretty normal. Father's been trying to convince me I should start writing to the Romanov heiress. She's apparently a duelling phenom at Durmstrang."*

*"I've thought about trying to write Viktor Krum,"* Draco admitted.

Harry seized the opening to change topics. *"He's the teenage Quidditch phenom, isn't he?* *The one who got subbed in for Bulgaria's World Cup qualifying matches back in June and hasn't missed a snitch?"*

*"That's him,"* said Cassius. *"He's brilliant --- one of the best I've ever seen."*

Pansy's throat clearing halted their conversation before they could get too carried away. *"And what about Dumbledore and Grindelwald?"*

*Damnit, Pansy.* Harry chewed his words. *Careful. "We know Dumbledore had connections. Wasn't he in contact with Flamel before graduating?"*

*"That much has been known for years."*

The sun had begun setting when Cassie proposed a stroll down Knockturn Alley. Harry's heart had missed a beat. His stare became suspicious. *It's like she waited until it was almost time for my meeting there...*

It was the first time Harry had been to Knockturn Alley without an adult, and the first time at night. The buildings looked ugly and grotesque in the light of day, their displays odd but unimpressive. That changed at night, when most of the alley's light came from its larger and more well-lit neighbour. Things that looked comical before lost their humour and made hairs rise on the back of Harry's neck. He fingered his wand, ready to draw at a moment's notice.

No need had come by the time the sun dipped below the tops of nearby buildings. Harry looked around, heart racing. Most of his friends looked unsurprised when he excused himself. Only Pansy asked after him whilst Crabbe and Goyle looked confused. The others were all hard to read.

Harry moved down the dark and deserted streets alone. Briefly he had considered wearing his cloak, but he had dismissed the idea. *If I can't handle walking down an alley, how will I ever be ready for someone like Black?*

Harry stopped in the shadow of a tall building that looked fit to collapse. Plaster peeled from rotting walls and mould crept across grease-stained windows.

"A charming place, isn't it?"

This time he had warning --- Regulus had given him the invitation days ago --- but still the voice made Harry shiver.

"You look different," he said, turning to face the man he knew was Voldemort. Gone was his chalk-white skin and gleaming red eyes, replaced by a strong jaw and carved, handsome cheekbones.

"Coming here would be ill-advised if I looked the same as when we last met."

"You have a good memory. I doubt I could remember what I looked like years ago well enough to recreate it."

If the comment surprised him, Voldemort showed no signs. "You would be surprised by the things a man remembers."

"Occlumency, right? Something about improving memory recall?"

The Dark Lord smiled. "Or maybe you would be unsurprised. Has Dumbledore begun teaching you Occlumency?"

Harry knew his expression had given him away and saw no reason to lie. "It was the only way he'd tell me the prophecy."

"The old man always liked his secrets." Voldemort raised a hand and Harry could feel... something change. *Weird. It's like the wards in Grindelwald's memory, but I can't sense magic like him.* "Occlumency can be used to recall memories perfectly."

*Bloody hell, that sounds useful.* "Passive Occlumency, I'm guessing?" Voldemort nodded. "I haven't learned any of that yet."

"What would you say if I pointed out that you were using it as we speak?"

*What?* Harry frowned. "Probably that I don't know what you're talking about."

"Any time you force yourself calm or inspect your own emotions, you're using a form of Passive Occlumency." Riddle's blue eyes sparkled. "The form is just less interesting than others you could use."

"What would you do if I asked you for that? If my one request was for you to help me master Occlumency."

Voldemort spread his hands. "I would see you become among the world's best."

A bitter taste coated his tongue. *He and Grindelwald talk the same way. It's like they already know their goals will happen just like they plan.* It was hard not believing them.

Voldemort leant forward. "Is this what you're asking of me?"

"I don't know yet," Harry admitted. "I'm still thinking."

"So you have not yet come to a decision?"

"Not yet." The path looked clear, but that last step was daunting. There was still one thing he planned on doing before taking that leap.

"You have until the summer's end," said Voldemort, turning away from him. Harry watched him step into the shadows and vanish without a sound. *Why does everything have to be so complicated?*

***August 18, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***8:56 PM***

Harry sat atop his bed and peered out the nearest window, lost in thought. *Thinking so much about dark lords can't be healthy.* First it had been Grindelwald with his memories, and now it was Voldemort with his return.

The worst part was that, by now, his thoughts just went in circles. *One choice makes Voldemort an enemy and gives me nothing, the other gives me almost anything I want.* He pulled a face. *So why is choosing so hard?*

Could it be his parents? *I never knew them.* Harry tried imagining their disappointed faces and felt naught but anger. They would want the best for him. *If they turned on me for making the smart choice, then they're not worth thinking about.*

No, his parents\' memory wasn't holding him back. *I'm paranoid and don't know what to ask for. I don't know what could be worth the risk.*

Grindelwald's pendant burned beneath his shirt, yet still it felt icy cold against his skin. *This is mad,* he thought, fingering the pendant.

Long hours had been spent lamenting his lack of freedom. Grindelwald wanted to use him more than anyone. *Why doesn't that bug me if I hate being used so much?* Grindelwald had the decency to be honest, which was one thing, but there were other reasons. *He wants to use me for something good, not just so he can be powerful again.*

It was the one problem he had with Malfoy's manipulations. Harry had gained and would say nothing so long as that continued, but he saw what was really going on.

"I wondered when you would next come."

"But you knew I would." Harry looked across the tower cell, watching the man staring at him from atop his battered cot. *I'm not nervous anymore. The memories are working. That should bother me.*

"I expect your return each time you leave, but always I wonder whether I may be wrong."

Harry swallowed a lump in his throat. "I don't think you'll be wrong any time soon."

A smile split Grindelwald's face. "It gladdens me to know you have considered what I have shown you and that my time has not been wasted." He steepled bone-thin fingers and let his smile fall. "I presume you have something for me to consider tonight."

Harry mussed his hair. "I know you can get things out of the cell if you want." Grindelwald remained still and made no attempts at lying. "If I tell you something important, will it stay a secret?"

"You are my last chance to change the world. I would not throw away that chance and your trust for the sake of gossip."

*Merlin, he's telling the truth, I can feel it.* Harry took a deep breath. "Voldemort is back."

"Back?" Grindelwald asked.

"Back," Harry repeated. "No one knows except a few of his followers."

"And you. How is it you came to know his most treasured secret?"

Harry shifted from foot to foot, a cool breeze blowing through the bars and splaying hair across his forehead. "It's complicated. I'm friends with Lucius Malfoy's kids and he's one of Voldemort's followers. There was a party at his manor, but he set up a meeting between Voldemort and I without me knowing."

"Yet you live."

Harry chewed his lip. "I don't think he wants to kill me."

"Explain." It was the sternest he'd ever heard Grindelwald speak.

Harry drummed shaking fingers against his thigh, deciding where to start. "I met him at the end of my first year. He was a wraith or something---"

"A wraith?"

"Or something. He lost his powers when he couldn't kill me. All he could do was possess people or animals. He possessed a professor and tried stealing the Philosopher's Stone."

Grindelwald took it all in stride. "So be it. What was he like?"

Harry frowned. "Kind of like you, but not. He gave me a speech about how awful muggles were and how the Statute of Secrecy was gonna fall. He could have killed me, but he wanted me to join him."

"And I presume he offered something similar upon your recent reunion?"

"Kind of. He wants a chance to win my trust, sort of like you did, but he's offering me anything I want as long as it doesn't go against any of his plans."

Grindelwald's face was unreadable. "A generous offer. Tell me, what do you think of him?"

That was a very loaded question. "What about him?"

Grindelwald closed his eyes. *He looks sad.* "You have not considered the things I asked you to."

Harry blushed, knots tightening in his stomach. *Why do I feel guilty?* "I have," he argued, "I've just been busy with the chamber and now this."

"You must consider things more closely. What is it you dream of? What differences do you plan to make in the world? Answer those questions and judge the merit of others against your own ambitions." Grindelwald waited for that to sink in. "So I ask you again, what is it you think of Voldemort? What does he intend and what do you think of his plans?"

Harry considered. *He really doesn't make it easy.* "He told me that muggles were dangerous and that they should be feared."

"You have no love for muggles. Less, I imagine, than when we first met." Harry scowled and nodded. He thought he'd known evil on Privet Drive, but now when he thought of muggles, he thought of punctured corpses and burning flesh.

His anger boiled and his hands curled into fists. "But they don't scare me."

"Don't they?"

"No," he insisted. "I just wish we weren't hiding. If they find us, everything that happens will be our fault."

A shadow flashed across Grindelwald's face. "Not ours. I have done everything to ensure us a position of power and, in time, I think you will too."

"Do they scare you?"

Grindelwald scowled. "They scared me the day I stood upon a burning pyre, but scarcely since. They are a threat to our existence and must be treated seriously, but the threat can be handled if only we act."

"I think Voldemort's afraid of them. He talks about the Statute falling like it would be a huge disaster. I think he wants to make sure it never happens."

"He is a fool. Someone so powerful should not be so defeated. Does Slytherin not house the ambitious?"

"So you don't like his plan?"

"His plan is meek and futile. The Statute will fall."

Harry shivered. "How can you be so sure?"

Grindelwald studied him. "I have foreseen it."

"Foreseen it?" Harry asked.

"You sound doubtful."

"I just don't think of Divination much, I guess." The words sounded weak, even to him. *You know of at least one prophecy that's true, why can't there be another?*

"Divination is scarce and unwieldy, but that does not mean it is without merit."

Harry nodded. *That should have been obvious.* "What did you see?"

"A shadow wreathed in fire, standing over their foe's charred corpse. A single hurdle stands between them and salvation, a hurdle beyond them or the weapon they carry despite its great power."

A shiver ran up Harry's spine. *If he was anyone else, I'd call him mad.* "You thought it was you," he said instead.

Grindelwald nodded, peering out the window. "It fit. I obtained a weapon of great power and knew I would one day face my greatest foe again."

"Dumbledore?"

"It could be no other."

Harry fidgeted. "But he beat you."

"Only fools believe they can bend the whims of fate. My naivety made me unworthy and I paid for it dearly."

*Weird way to describe it, unworthy.* "That's why you're helping me, isn't it?" he asked. "You think that could be me."

Grindelwald just shrugged his shoulders. "You or another, it matters not to me. I have long-since learned not to meddle in the affairs of fate. I shall not work to further the vision, I will do only what I think is best for the world."

*Him and his riddles...* "And you think what's best for the world is helping me?"

"I do."

"Then what would you do if you were me? What would you do if Voldemort made you an offer?"

"I would seize the opportunity with great caution, lustful of its rewards but wary of its giver."

A part of him breathed a sigh of relief. *That's what I've been thinking for ages.*

"You wish for something else of me," Grindelwald said, watching him. "Ask it."

Harry let out a long breath, running a hand through his hair. "I don't know what to ask from him. I feel like it should be something I can't get from anyone else. I could ask how he survived the backfiring Killing Curse---"

"He would not tell you."

Harry nodded. "That's what I thought." Frustration gnawed at him. "There's so much I could ask for, but I can't think of anything good."

A strong wind blew through the open window, rattling the bars. "There is something. Something that only Voldemort could give you if the whispers are true."

***August 22, 1993***

***The Black Library***

***3:44 PM***

Harry's mind calmed some after his talk with Grindelwald, but it remained plagued. There was no doubt how he felt about muggles, but talking of plans and opinions had gotten him thinking. What was the best way to handle them? *Grindelwald's sounds better. It can't be that hard to take them over --- we have magic.*

Harder to answer were the questions about Sirius Black. A dozen old copies of the *Daily Prophet* littered the desk in front of him. Lucius had been able to get him every paper that ever mentioned Black, but none had been helpful so far. *Narcissa wasn't kidding --- him switching sides really* does *feel random.*

*CRACK!*

Harry looked up with a sigh. *A break might not be the worst thing.* "Hello, Kreacher."

The elf bowed low. "Someone wishes to see you, young master."

Harry frowned. "Who is it?"

"They be telling Kreacher their name is Nott."

Harry had yet to talk alone with Theodore all summer, but every time they had met, he looked troubled. *This should be interesting.* "Send him in, but take these papers first. Leave them in my room, please."

Kreacher bowed and popped away; the papers vanished with him.

Harry walked to the nearest window and peeled back the curtains. The sun was drifting westward and towards a distant forest. The trees' shadows lengthened the further it sank.

The door opened soundlessly behind him; he could sense it despite hearing nothing.

"You look tired," said Theodore.

Harry rubbed at his eyes. "I haven't slept much," he admitted.

"I'm not surprised." Theodore stepped up beside him. "How are you handling everything?"

"Everything?" Harry asked.

Theodore glanced around the room then lowered his voice to a whisper. "We both know he's back." Harry tensed. *At least that answers the question whether or not he knows. Figures. If there was ever an obvious Death Eater, it's Tiberius Nott.* "There's no point pretending we don't."

His heart beat hard. "What else do you know?" Harry asked.

"What else do *you* know?" Theodore returned.

"Probably more than you." Theodore said nothing. "Fine." Now it was Harry's turn to look around the room despite knowing it was empty but for them and several thousand books. "I probably shouldn't need to say this, but let's keep this between us."

Theodore snorted. "I wouldn't have said anything if that wasn't the plan."

Harry collected his thoughts. *Here goes nothing.* "I know he's back and that he's keeping it quiet, and I know that a few of his followers know but that most don't." He looked away from the window, instead watching Theodore. "What about you?"

Theodore wrung his hands. "I know he's trying to recruit you and hoping for some kind of answer soon. Nothing else, really, besides that they're planning something."

Harry rubbed his eyes. "I doubt they're ever not planning something."

"Father's been gone more the last few weeks and he looks tired any time he's home."

"What happened to his hand?" Harry asked, remembering the glove he'd worn at his birthday party.

Theodore looked away. "I don't know. I haven't seen it since getting home from Hogwarts."

Something about that bothered him. *It's like the answer's on the tip of my tongue, but that makes no sense.* "Any guesses about the plan?"

Theodore looked away again. "Something involving Black, maybe? I doubt it's an accident he broke out right after the Dark Lord's return."

Harry scowled, rage churning inside his stomach. *And here we go again with Black...* "You're worried about me now that Black is out, aren't you?"

"We all are. Black was dangerous. There's a reason he was given life in Azkaban."

"I doubt V-the Dark Lord broke him out." Theodore's eyes were wide, his face pale. *Way to slip; you'll have to clean that up if you plan on taking his offer.* "If the Dark Lord broke him out," Harry went on, "I wouldn't need to worry about him, not if he wanted to recruit me."

"I don't know," said Theodore. "Azkaban's an awful place; most prisoners go mad."

Harry clenched his fists so hard, his palms grew hot. "I'm not afraid of him." All he felt was rage akin to the night Aberforth had made him kill the lamb, the night he had brutalized Cadmus Yaxley and revealed he was a Parselmouth.

Theodore sighed. "You're going to go after him, aren't you? The same way you went after the Heir of Slytherin?"

Harry imagined himself standing over Black, his wand aimed at the traitor's chest. A hungry beast roared inside his stomach, calling for blood. *Merlin, I'm just a kid and he's a murderer. What chance do I have?*

*None yet,* another voice whispered, *but with Grindelwald's help...* "I don't know."

Theodore screwed up his face and reached into the pocket of his robes. "At least take this. It might help."

"What is it?" Harry asked, scanning the blank cover of what looked like a very old book.

"One of the books from our family library." Theodore's voice became a whisper again. "Only Notts know the spells in here."

*So the rumours about old families and their magics are true?* That made the book priceless. "Theodore... you're sure?"

Theodore only nodded.

***August 29, 1993***

***Knockturn Alley***

***9:00 PM***

Voldemort was waiting in the shadow of the same building they had last met beneath. The Dark Lord was once more wearing Tom Riddle's face and drumming his fingers against the building's peeling wall.

"Was I late?" Harry asked, frowning.

"No," said Voldemort, removing his hand from the wall. "It's just that I have never been a patient man."

Harry took a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heart. "I still have questions."

"Ask them. I have waited long enough."

Harry steeled his resolve. "You once told me that you worried about the Statute of Secrecy. How do you plan to make sure it never falls?"

"The first step is seizing the ministry. I can begin severing ties more easily then."

*Severing ties? Does that mean the two governments work together?* Frustration gnawed at him but he kept it down. It was a well-worded answer. "What do you want from me?"

Voldemort tilted his head. "I have told you already. I would like an open mind and an opportunity to convince you my ways are right. I mean to one day offer you a place at my side."

Harry studied him, watching for any signs of deception. "So if I say yes, all you expect is that I keep in touch and listen?"

"I expect much from you, but I will not ask for it yet. Not until a firmer relationship has been agreed to." Harry looked for traps in Voldemort's words. "This agreement does not obligate you to fight for me, nor to take my mark."

Harry cleared his mind, steeling his nerves. *Here we go...* "Then I agree."

Voldemort's eyes gleamed. "Excellent. What is it you ask of me in return?"

***September 1, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***9:24 AM***

Raindrops drummed against the tall windows. It was hard to see much through the stained glass, but every few minutes, lightning would paint the grounds outside in a wash of white. Harry remembered the first day of school last year and how bright it had been. *That year wound up being a mess, so hopefully this is a good sign.* There was Sirius Black to deal with, but better him than Voldemort. Anxiety clamped down hard on his chest. *If he wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already. It's going to work out.*

"It's going to feel different without you," Regulus said, sipping at his tea.

It would feel different; the whole summer had felt different. *It's the first year I wasn't counting down the days until Hogwarts.* "It's gonna be weird leaving." A shadow crossed Regulus's face, aging him ten years. "Is everything all right?"

Regulus put down his glass. "I owe you an apology."

Harry frowned. "An apology for what?"

"The way I've handled my brother's escape from Azkaban."

"I get it," Harry assured him, "you don't need---"

"Yes, I do. You started off wary of me. I felt like I was making good progress, then I handled everything like a brooding child."

"It's all right," said Harry, blushing.

"None of how I've acted was all right," said Regulus. "I'm not your father and I doubt you want me to be, but you are my ward. I had a responsibility and I neglected that." That same shadow lingered atop his face. "Nothing about that is all right. I'm sorry."

*I don't think an adult has ever apologized to me before.* Dumbledore had, but not so plainly. *I think he regrets how the Dursleys acted more than anything. He wasn't sorry for sticking me with muggles.* The thought made him seethe, but the anger cooled while he stared across the table.

"Thank you," he muttered, unsure what else to say.

Regulus pushed hair back from his eyes. "My parents made many mistakes. Neglecting Sirius and I is just one of them, but I won't repeat it. There are things you should know before you leave."

His pulse quickened. "What kind of things?"

"Things that will help you if my brother attacks."

Harry straightened in his chair. "Like how he fights?"

Regulus looked past him and out the large windows, silent until another flash of lightning came and went. "I can't give you much there. Sirius fought for the Order of the Phoenix before I ever joined the Dark Lord."

Harry frowned. "The what?"

"The Order of the Phoenix. It's what Dumbledore called his vigilante group, but that's not important."

Harry made himself nod, quelling a rush of disappointment. "Right, Sirius."

"Sirius isn't the world's best duellist. They say the Dark Lord trained him, and maybe he did, but I doubt that's changed. Your father was better and so was Snape, but my brother could go toe-to-toe with either of them."

"Because he was smarter?" It was the obvious answer.

A sad smile played across Regulus's lips. "Not exactly. My brother was a Black and a Gryffindor. That's a dangerous combination. All our family's ruthless cunning with a stubborn boldness that goes against all of it."

*That just sounds like it contradicts itself.* "I'm not sure what you mean."

"I mean that predicting what Sirius will do is impossible. People like you and I might expect him to lay traps, then he'll jump out and face you in the open before you're ready. Then you'll learn and play on his pride next time, only for him to order a tactical retreat." Regulus pushed away his glass of tea. "My brother was the closest thing I've ever seen to chaos, and there's no predicting that."

*That sounds like a nightmare.* Harry studied Regulus across the table. "I thought you said you never fought him."

"I grew up with him. No one knows him better than me."

Harry remembered what Theodore said the last time they'd talked. "Theodore says Azkaban might have driven him mad."

"Theodore may be right. Sirius might have changed, but not that part of him. Madness can only change a man so much."

*It sounds like he's said that before, or at least thought it.* "So have a plan, but be ready to change it."

"Exactly."

Harry could do that. There had been no plan last year and still he had prevailed. *So what if I had help, I still did it.* There had been first year, but... *I'm better than that now.*

"Is there anything else?" Harry asked, wiping those dark thoughts from his mind.

Regulus's expression grew grim. "Have you ever heard of the term Animagus?"

***About two hours later, on the Hogwarts Express...***

Harry and Theodore made quiet small talk whilst they waited for the others. Draco arrived first, flanked on either side by Crabbe and Goyle. They had grown this summer; Harry had never seen a pair of third years so large.

"You're later than usual," Theodore remarked once Draco sat down.

"Father talked for longer than usual." It was the second time this past week Draco had missed a chance to look smug when talking about his father.

"Bad news?" Harry asked carefully.

Draco looked out the window. "I'll tell you once Pansy gets here."

Pansy arrived just seconds before the train's departure. Harry noticed that her hair and makeup were perfect --- she looked better than he remembered. *Weird, I just saw her in Diagon.* He shrugged it off. His planned meeting with Voldemort had loomed over him all day; he hadn't exactly been at his best.

Draco's lip curled when Pansy walked in. "Would it kill you to be on time?"

She made a face at him then leaned over Harry to place her luggage in the overhead compartment. Their bodies rubbed together. Pansy shifted but it only made it worse. Harry tried leaning away, but Pansy moved again, still fighting with her trunk. *You're over people touching you and she's just putting up her trunk, calm down.* He forced his mind clear and waited for her to finish, fighting down a blush.

"I don't think it would kill *you* not to be insufferable," Pansy snapped back at Draco once she'd finished, now sitting beside Harry.

"Being insufferable is half the fun. Being late just drags everyone down."

Theodore smirked. "Speaking of being insufferable, are you planning anything for Weasley?"

"No."

Theodore raised an eyebrow and Harry too was surprised. *That was a pretty short answer.* "Are you all right, Draco?" Theodore asked. "Do we need to take you to Pomfrey once we get there?"

Draco sneered. "I've grown up, Nott. You should try it sometime."

*That touched a nerve.* "I *still* haven't heard anything about the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher," said Pansy, pouting. *Good timing.*

Everyone looked at Draco. "Father hasn't mentioned anything; I don't think he knows."

"Dumbledore's leaving it late again," said Theodore.

Harry's thoughts drifted towards the memory of two boys and their talks of muggles and Hallows. "I know we talked about it in Diagon, but I bet Skeeter's book hasn't helped."

"That book really is something," Pansy said with a dreamy smile.

Theodore snorted. "You would think so. Skeeter must be your idol."

Pansy clicked her tongue. "I would never pick an idol with such poor fashion sense." She wrinkled her nose. "That jewellery makes me sick, and don't even get me started on the glasses or the hair---"

Harry cut her off. "There was something you wanted to tell us, Draco?"

Draco looked cross. "I'd hoped to wait a bit longer. It isn't pleasant news."

Harry grimaced. "The news I have is probably worse, so we might as well get it all over with."

"If what you have is worse, we're in for a long year."

"The world doesn't have a habit of doing nice things for me."

Pansy swatted Harry on the arm. "Bad joke," she chided.

Harry blushed. "Sorry."

Draco waited for quiet. "There are going to be guards at Hogwarts this year."

"Guards?" Harry asked. "What's so bad about guards?"

Draco grimaced. "I don't mean aurors."

Pansy paled and Theodore looked ill. "You can't mean---"

"Dementors."

Harry picked through his memories. "I don't know much about dementors, just that they guard Azkaban and that the *Prophet* mentioned they were helping aurors look for Black."

Pansy shivered. "They're awful creatures."

"Effective ones, though," said Theodore.

"What is it they actually do?"

Theodore shifted in his chair. "They feed on happiness. Father... well, he was held there after the Dark Lord fell while he waited for a trial."

Harry's eyes narrowed. *That can't be legal.* "They held him in Azkaban to wait for a trial?"

"Don't sound so surprised," Theodore said darkly. "The ministry didn't play fair last war and they knew they'd been infiltrated. Pretty much anyone they thought might be connected to the Dark Lord got that treatment."

"So he's met them first hand then?"

Theodore nodded. "He says the cold is the worst, says there's nothing like it; like your blood turning to icy water."

"I've heard they make people relive their worst memories," Pansy said quietly.

Now it was Harry who shivered. *Bloody hell. I hope Occlumency works against that.* Wylla Nurmen screamed and seeping blood spread slowly across a field of reddening snow.

Draco who nodded. "Father says they've driven men mad."

"But they won't do anything like that to us, right?" Goyle asked.

"That's not how it works," said Crabbe, surprising all of them. He blushed, looking down at the floor. "I like magical creatures."

Theodore made a sweeping gesture. "No, please, go on."

Crabbe's blush deepened. "Dementors don't see. They just kind of feel around and can't tell most people apart."

"And Dumbledore's letting them guard Hogwarts?" *That doesn't sound like him.*

"I don't think old Dumbles had much choice," said Draco. "His influence isn't what it was. That book has done a number on him. He stepped down as Chief Warlock, but some people still want him off the ICW."

"I'm shocked he's still headmaster," said Pansy.

Harry shook his head. "I'm not. Dumbledore would do anything before giving that up." *And Aberforth was right; he has enough titles to give up so people stay happy.*

"I never thought I'd wish that Dumbledore got his way," Theodore said with a scowl.

"Dementors must have a weakness though, right? Like how boggarts can be fought off with the Riddikulus Charm. They'll probably teach us all how to fight them."

Theodore smirked at him; it was a mirthless expression. "I forget how new you are to all this sometimes. It's cute you're so confident."

Dread crept through him. "You mean there's no way to fight them?" *It would explain why no one had escaped before Black, but that can't be right...*

"There's a spell, but they won't teach it. Father mentioned it once and said it was way beyond NEWT-level. Plenty of aurors can't cast it."

"What's the spell?" Harry asked.

"No idea, I just know there is one."

"Do you still think your news is worse?" Draco asked, leaning back in his seat.

Harry winced. "I wish I could say it wasn't, but I think Sirius Black being an Animagus is pretty bad."

Pansy screamed so loudly beside his ear that he smashed his head against the window.

***Meanwhile, in another compartment...***

Ron leant forward, a card between his fingers. The compartment was quiet as he reached out, waiting to see if the pile of cards would explode. Raindrops drummed against the train outside, but Ron focused on the cards. *Come on, come on.*

"Gah!" A small shape lunged, knocking the cards to the floor and pawing Ron's arm aside, rushing towards Scabbers, who tried scampering away. "Get away from him!" Ron yelled, kicking at the cat.

"Don't kick him!" Hermione shouted.

"Then get him the hell away from Scabbers!"

Hermione huffed but scooped Crookshanks off the seat and into her lap. Scabbers trembled beside Ron. Susan hid a giggle behind her hand whilst Hannah looked nervously from Ron to Hermione. Cedric just stared out the window while the cat's large eyes continued watching Scabbers.

***That evening...***

Their mood remained low, unhelped by the view outside. Rain-soaked trees sagged beneath the weight of dripping leaves and grass lay flat against sludge-filled fields.

Only after the trolley lady's appearance and a brief visit from their older friends did the mood lighten.

"What classes are you taking, Harry?" Pansy asked.

"Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, and Care of Magical Creatures."

Theodore raised a hand across the compartment. "I'll see you there."

Pansy pouted. "I'm only going to see you in Care of Magical Creatures."

"You took Divination?" She nodded. Harry had dismissed that class when choosing back in April, but he was less sure now. *Even if Grindelwald's vision is fake, it's hard to argue with him about magic.* He supposed it mattered not; there was no time for him to take a fourth elective.

Draco looked troubled. "I took the same classes as Pansy, but I think I'm going to ask Professor Snape to change my timetable."

Pansy screwed up her face. "To change it?"

Draco nodded, staring out the window. Now they sped beside a muggle road so covered in water that it reflected dark trees and the grey sky above. "I've reconsidered over the summer; Father's had a lot to do with that." Harry eyed his expression. *I'll bet the Chamber of Secrets had more to do with it than his father.*

Crabbe and Goyle were in the same classes as Draco but had no plans of swapping. Guilt twisted inside his stomach each time Harry looked at Crabbe. How could he have known him for two years and only now realized he liked magical creatures? *The most I've ever talked with him is in Potions, and that's just giving instructions.* The guilt sharpened.

The sky outside darkened and their chatter settled down. Dusk fell then gave way to night. The sky ahead was darker; it made Harry feel like they were nearing the mouth of a great, black tunnel.

Draco was sipping his water when the train lurched. It spilled out over the floor and onto Theodore's robes beside him whilst Draco fell into a fit of coughing. Harry paid them no heed. *Something's wrong.*

"We shouldn't be stopping," he muttered, standing to get a better view out the window. "Damn, I can't see a thing."

"Lumos," Pansy slid nearer, pressing her wand against the glass. Harry squinted through the night. It was like the darkness swarmed every ray of light and snuffed it out. It was like staring into the deep sea long past twilight.

*"My brother was a Black and a Gryffindor. That's a dangerous combination. All our family's ruthless cunning with a stubborn boldness that goes against all of it."*

*"I'm not sure what you mean."*

*"I mean that predicting what Sirius will do is impossible. People like you and I might expect him to lay traps, then he'll jump out and face you in the open before you're ready. Then you'll learn and play on his pride next time, only for him to order a tactical retreat. My brother was the closest thing I've ever seen to chaos, and there's no predicting that."*

"Wands out!" Everyone drew their wands. Harry found himself surprised. *I didn't actually think they'd listen.* The words had come unbidden, spoken without thought.

Still he squinted out the window. *Something's out there, I can feel it.* Had Black learned the dementors would be at Hogwarts? Did he think his chances were better now, before they arrived?

Theodore stepped beside him. "It's blacker than Death out there; I don't know how anyone---" he cut himself off; the train's main door had opened.

Harry drew a finger across his lips and silently aimed his wand towards their compartment door. *Let him try; I'll bury him in curses before he casts a spell!*

Someone screamed from further up the train, then there was silence. Harry pricked his ears, waiting for more. Not so much as a footstep came from outside their door, but Harry could sense someone moving outside.

The compartment opened silently and someone stepped across the threshold.

"OSSIO EXPLOSSO!"

The spell slammed against Black's chest. Glee lit inside Harry, burning away all but itself and a sick satisfaction. *Everyone was so worried about him. Azkaban must have made him---*

His mouth fell open. Black continued walking --- no, gliding --- towards him. *It can't be Black,* Harry realized as the pieces came together. A hooded head loomed near the ceiling and its owner moved with inhuman grace.

A long, rattling breath came from beneath the hood. The torches died, Pansy's Lumos charm went out, and cold crept beneath Harry's skin. *A dementor.*

Pansy slumped back into the seat behind her and Theodore stood, frozen and trembling. *Great* --- Theodore had been the most knowledgeable of them when it came to dementors.

Harry looked at the others. Crabbe was slumped on the compartment's floor, his knees pulled up to his chest. Goyle looked lucid but cowered in a corner whilst Draco... *Merlin, he looks bad.* His wand had fallen from nerveless fingers and he trembled worse than any of them.

*"Father says they've driven men mad."*

*Why not me?* Harry stared towards the creature's head. Memories came, but he remained unbroken. Starved nights in his cupboard on Privet Drive, the awful sound when Longbottom's neck snapped, pale snow drinking Wylla Nurmen's dying blood, white-hot flames licking up his legs. His scar throbbed, but he felt little else. *Maybe Grindelwald really did drive me insane and I just didn't realize.*

Harry threw another spell at the dementor. It winked out against its chest, but the monster turned its head towards him. "Leave!"

The dementor cocked its head. It did not retreat, but neither did it advance. Harry stepped forward, brandishing his wand.

The dementor lurched, arms raised wardingly towards Harry. *What the...* There was nothing else for it. "I said leave!"

The dementor glided wordlessly from the compartment. Torches burst back to life and the door slid shut.

Harry sagged back into his seat, wincing and exhausted. Every inch of him felt heavy and his eyelids fluttered beneath his burning scar. *What are the odds? Of course Voldemort just happens to do something big right while I'm in the middle of all this nonsense.*

***September 1, 1993***

***Hogsmeade Station***

***9:09 PM***

The train buzzed with students speculating about the dementor. Harry's friends talked too, but their tones were different.

"Merlin," Theodore breathed in awe, "Harry, you just... I've never seen anything like it."

"That was incredible!" Pansy praised.

Draco had only the strength to nod. *The dementor really got to him.* His scar gave another throb, but Harry ignored it. *Why not me?* he thought for the hundredth time. *I've gone through much worse than Draco.*

The rain was falling hard when they stepped off the train. Thunder boomed and lightning lit the silhouette of Hogwarts in the distance, veiled by heavy sheets of rain.

Harry was grateful for the weather. It offered an escape from the praise and questions since his friends could hardly hear each other, even when nestled in the carriages.

They were all soaked and shivering by the time they finally stepped inside. Harry nearly ran head-first into Weasley being led away by Madam Pomfrey. *What the hell is that about?* He looked over his shoulder to watch and saw that Granger was walking in the wrong direction too, following in the footsteps of Professor McGonagall. *Merlin, what have they gotten into this time?*

"Harry, a word?"

Harry smiled and waved his friends on. "Sure, Cassius, what's up?"

Cassius glanced back over his shoulder and Harry took the hint, picking through the crowd and into the alcove beneath the marble staircase. Harry hissed quietly and the doorknob appeared.

Cassius shivered. "Merlin, that's creepy," he said once they'd entered the passage and closed the door behind them.

Harry rubbed at his scar. The pain had largely faded, but a stubborn prickle remained. "What is?"

"You know... the hissing."

Harry shrugged. "All of Slytherin knows I can do it. There's no point in hiding it so long as only you lot are around."

"I'll get used to it, it might just take a while. When anyone like us thinks about Parseltongue..." The rest went unsaid --- they thought about Voldemort.

"Well, I'm not him."

"I know," said Cassius, looking away, "just... there have been rumours."

*So Cassius really doesn't know.* Harry wondered once more just how many of his friends knew what was happening. "I get it, just don't expect me not to use it."

Cassius gave a nervous half-smile. "Yeah, of course. How are you holding up?"

Harry frowned. "Me?"

"Yeah, you know... the dementor. It got me pretty good and I think we've both been through some stuff. I just figured..." he let his voice trail off.

*Cassius might be the best friend I have.* No one else had ever checked on him this way --- no one but Diana, whose loyalties remained unsure. "It didn't seem to affect me," he admitted.

Cassius looked puzzled. "Didn't affect you?"

"I don't know how else to say it. It got to everyone else, but I was fine. Colder than hell until Crabbe told us to eat some chocolate, but that was about it." Cassius looked pensive. "I know Occlumency, maybe that was it."

Cassius wiped stray drops of water from his brow. "Maybe. I've only ever heard of Occlumency, so I can't say much. You figure some of the prisoners would know it, though, and they say dementors get to all of them in the end."

*It makes no sense.* "It was only in the compartment for a minute. Maybe it would have gotten to me if it stayed longer."

Cassius nodded, but he was still frowning. "We should get to the feast. No good to miss the sorting and all that."

They slipped silently into the hall partway through the sorting. A thousand plates and goblets gleamed beneath the cloud-filled ceiling. The ghosts appeared brighter than usual against the bleakness outside; all except the Bloody Baron, who stood silent as ever.

"Did I miss anything interesting?" Harry asked, sitting between Theodore and Pansy.

Pansy yawned. "A few new first years, but no one that interesting. Millicent's younger brother, Arthur, the Avery heir, and one other. Daphne's---"

"Greengrass, Astoria!"

Pansy cut herself off; there was no need to finish.

Harry watched Astoria's path towards the stool. Her head was high but he noticed her shoulders shaking and saw that her hands were in her robes. Her hair was darker than her sister's and she was shorter than Daphne had been at that age.

Harry felt the stare and turned, meeting narrow, sapphire eyes. Her hand gripped the table's edge, knuckles white against the emerald cloth. *She doesn't like the idea of me being around her sister.*

Harry smiled mockingly then turned back around just in time for the hat to shout "SLYTHERIN!"

*Interesting,* Harry thought, watching Astoria walk across the hall. Daphne's betrayal still weighed heavily in his thoughts. Watching her sister brought all those feelings back. *She probably hates me; Merlin only knows what Daphne's told her.* But if she didn't...

A Macnair, a Rowle, and a Thicknesse joined Slytherin. Harry recognized the first two names, and Pansy mentioned that there was a rising ministry official named Thicknesse working in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.

The sorting concluded when a dark-haired girl named Romilda Vane was sorted into Gryffindor.

Dumbledore rose from the staff table, but the hall did not quiet. A wall of chatter wafted through the hall, breaking against Dumbledore like snow against the castle walls. *I've never seen anyone look so unbothered by something like this.*

"We are a restless bunch tonight," Dumbledore said once quiet prevailed. "I will not try and hold back the tide. Let the merrymaking begin!"

The scents of beef and bacon intermingled with the smell of gravy, fresh fruit, and a dozen other unnamed things. They all wafted through the hall, hanging in the air like the rain-filled clouds outside. Chatter soon erupted, whistling through the room like a gusting wind, taking all decorum with it.

"You never did explain what happened with her," Pansy whispered in Harry's ear, jerking her head towards Daphne.

Harry swallowed a mouthful of mashed potatoes. "I'd rather not."

Pansy made large, puppy eyes. "Please?"

Harry sighed. He had planned to keep his friends out of it since he doubted Daphne would involve them, but Pansy talked with her often. *She has the right to know.* "She tried poisoning me in November, then rigged an exploding statue later in the year."

Pansy clamped a hand to her mouth. "What? Why?"

Harry scowled. "She thought I was the Heir of Slytherin."

"Then why was she still glaring at you? She knows that isn't true now."

That was an interesting question, but Harry thought he knew. *She's so sure she's right, just like Voldemort and Grindelwald.* Daphne would never be their equal with a wand, but she was probably the smartest witch at Hogwarts. *Anyone that smart is always so sure they're right.* Harry had learned that while dealing with the two dark lords.

"I guess you'd have to ask her," he said instead, sawing at his steak.

Pansy huffed. "I don't think I will."

"You're friends, aren't you?" Harry asked without looking up.

"We *were* friends, but not anymore." She smiled. "You were always better than her."

"That girl could be the world's greatest spy if she learned to hold her tongue," Theodore said while Pansy visited with other friends further up the table.

Draco set down his goblet. "I don't think she could. She's too emotional."

Theodore laughed. "Look who's talking, Draco."

Draco sneered. "I told you already, I've grown up. She hasn't yet, and neither have you. You learn from your mistakes once you do."

Theodore sneered right back. "Some of us don't need to transform ourselves to be decent human beings."

Harry ignored them, focusing on the food. *I feel like a fat slob or something.* No one around him was eating half so much. Then he remembered the dementor and wondered again why he had been so unaffected.

Pansy soon returned, vibrating with excitement. "Have you heard?" she asked them.

"Heard what?" asked Theodore.

"About Weasley?"

Draco yawned. "Which one? There are about a dozen of them and I don't expect that woman's done making more."

"Oh, cut it out, you know which one I'm talking about."

"King Weasley?" Theodore asked, smirking. Many Slytherins had taken to calling Ron that after his fumbled catch during their Quidditch match last November.

"Yes, him."

Draco scowled. "I can't say I've cared enough to pay attention. Why? Should I have heard something?"

Pansy giggled. "He had a fit on the train; he fell off his seat and everything! The big, bad Quidditch star was afraid of the dementor! Someone even told me he wet himself!"

Harry ignored them again. Never before had he played these games and he would not start now --- certainly not whilst remembering a night sitting out near the Black Lake. *I don't remember them being so cocky when the dementor walked in, and Weasley has a better reason to be afraid.*

The food vanished, replaced by desserts of all names. Harry smelt chocolate, cinnamon, and a dozen other things that he could name. The hall grew louder in the minutes to come, reenergized by the sugar. Crabbe had limped through dinner all night, clearly still plagued by the dementor's effects, but he burned through dessert with a fervour that Dudley would have envied.

Harry looked away. *No one should have that much in their mouth at once.* He looked up at the staff table and noticed only one difference. A man in tattered robes sat beside Professor McGonagall, his hair streaked with grey. Harry frowned. *Is he the new professor?* The man looked like someone he would stumble across in Knockturn Alley.

Harry tapped Pansy on the shoulder. "Who's that?" he asked, pointing.

"He must be the new Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor."

"I gathered that. I was wondering if you knew who he was."

"Oh," she blushed. "I don't think I've ever seen him before."

"It doesn't matter," said Theodore, who must have been eavesdropping. "Dumbledore will tell us soon enough."

The desserts vanished not five minutes later, taking the gilded plates and goblets with them.

This time the hall quieted more quickly when Dumbledore stood. "Welcome! I sense you are wearier than usual, so I shan't keep you long.

"First years should note that the forest on the edge of the grounds is called the Forbidden Forest for a reason. It is not a place to be trifled with and anyone caught sneaking through it will be punished.

"Those interested in playing for their House Quidditch teams should present themselves to their heads of house by the end of next week. Tryouts will be arranged by your respective captains sometime this month. I look forward to a full and exciting year of Quidditch after its forced cancellation last May."

One of the Weasley twins whooped from the Gryffindor table and soon the hall was filled with raucous applause.

Dumbledore smiled. "I hope you're as enthusiastic for your new professor." Quiet muttering replaced the cheers and Dumbledore waited for silence before continuing. "This year, Professor Lupin will be taking on the daunting prospect of teaching you all Defence Against the Dark Arts."

There was polite applause, but nothing like the stir Aberforth's hiring had caused last year.

"On to less pleasant news. As you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are here on Ministry of Magic business." *He really isn't happy; he went out of his way to make sure we know it wasn't his fault.*

"They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds," Dumbledore continued, "and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises --- or even invisibility cloaks." Harry kept his expression still.

"It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors."

Ringing silence rang through the hall. Not even the Weasley twins stirred.

Dumbledore smiled again. "Now, you are all weary and I fear that I have troubled you. Off to bed with you all."

Harry stepped up beside Draco whilst they moved towards the stone steps leading down into the dungeons. "You actually respect him, don't you?"

"Who?" Draco whispered back, glancing around them. The only ones nearby were the rest of their friends, but they had fallen several paces back.

"Weasley."

Draco sneered, but it looked half-hearted. "Something like that," he muttered, looking away and slowing his stride so that the others caught up.

"Excuse me?"

A tall girl blocked their path. *Not that tall,* Harry realized, eyeing the Head Girl badge on her chest, *just older.*

"Yes?"

"You're Harry Potter, right?" *As if she doesn't know.* He nodded. "I've been told to give this to you." Harry took the offered parchment, wondering why she, of all people, had been sent to pass it on.

*Harry,*

*It would be my pleasure to speak with you this Friday evening if you would indulge an old man and his whims. We have much to discuss with such a chaotic year ahead of us and I think it would behoove both of us to do so promptly.*

*Yours truly,*

*Albus Dumbledore*

*PS: After many years of procrastination, I have finally tried and taken a liking to Fizzing Whizbees!*

Harry nearly snorted. Someone as brilliant as Dumbledore was bound to have some quirks, but Merlin, did that man ever have his.

***August 19, 1899***

***The Dumbledore Family Home***

***11:33 AM***

That morning dawned brightly. Leaves bathed in warm sunlight beneath a deep-blue sky and the grass was soft underfoot. Everything appeared starker in this sunlight; the grass was greener, the trees more lush, and the sky a perfect shade of blue.

None of it made Gellert regret their plans. They would leave on the morrow and head for France, where Nicholas Flamel had arranged Albus a meeting with the French Minister for Magic.

The man knew naught what Albus planned to say, nor that a friend would accompany him. That had been when Gellert knew he'd won. *Albus would not risk that connection if he was anything less than devoted.*

*"There is no better place to start,"* Albus had said. *"We must try to win world powers to our side with words."*

Gellert would have agreed to anything. It had taken time to convince Albus this was their only course. The world would be better for it, but Albus thought too often of the smaller problems that their pursuit would fix in time.

Everything was decided. Albus's siblings would stay with a friend he'd met at school --- a strange fellow named Elphias Doge. Aberforth had raged, but Albus had not wavered. Gellert had smiled at Aberforth just before he left the room. *Foolishness never wins.*

"I can't believe we're leaving," Albus muttered, looking up and over the tops of distant trees.

"The time has come," Gellert said with reverence.

"Part of me still wonders how you convinced me."

Gellert smirked. "You knew that I was right. Little convincing was needed." It was untrue, but better to let Albus believe. *His recent decisiveness does him credit.*

A door slammed behind them. Gellert tensed but kept his eyes forward until Albus gasped beside him.

He turned his head. The fool boy was back, but that was not what stilled Gellert's heart. *No! This can't happen!* The girl hung limply in his arms, mouth ajar and pale strands of hair splayed across her forehead. Panic seized him, but not for the child. *No... not now, not this close.*

"Aberforth!" Albus rushed forward and took the girl from his arms. "What happened?"

"Your plans are dead, you won't be running off with him." Aberforth spat the last word like it was something foul, glaring at Gellert over his brother's shoulder. *The mounting anger pours from him in a last-ditch attempt.* Nothing scared him worse than the idea that it might just work.

*He cannot be allowed to ruin this.* "You watch your tongue, you hear me?" Gellert spat back, his blood pumping. "Do not ever---"

"Gellert! That's enough!" Gellert growled then fell silent. Albus looked up, still kneeling over his sister. "Explain yourself, Aberforth."

"Explain myself?!" the boy raged, spit flying. "Look at her! Does she look prepared for the care of your dim-witted friend?"

Albus took a deep breath. "Elphias is sharper than you realize. You will speak of him with respect---"

"I will speak how I choose!" The boy was shaking now, soundless tears rolling down his cheeks. Gellert's stomach nodded, but not for the boy.

"Aberforth, listen to me---"

"No, Albus! I've listened long enough. Look where it's gotten us! LOOK AT HER!" Albus's eyes fell towards his sister and Gellert watched his shoulders sag. "You know I can't control her during the fits. This is your fault. You must stay behind and care for her. Her death will be on your hands if you leave."

"You go too far!" Gellert roared, drawing his wand. "Your incompetence should shackle no one."

The boy's own wand appeared in his hand. "It isn't about competence, Grindelwald! Albus has practised, I can't---"

"Excuses!" Aberforth's hand trembled and his wand's tip sparked. *Give me a reason, you worm.*

"Excuses? Is that what you'll tell your victims' families?"

Albus looked up. "Aberforth! You will hold your tongue!"

"No," said Gellert, "go on."

"You would watch my sister rot if it got you an ounce of what you wanted. No one means anything compared to your goals. You know nothing of love; all you know is greed and dominance."

"Aberforth!" snapped Albus. "I said that's enough!"

"No," said Gellert, his voice low, "he's right."

Albus's eyes swivelled towards him. "Gellert... you can't mean that."

Gellert banished the last of his restraint. *I can't believe this is happening.* "If love is what shackles you and blinds your brother, then he is right, I know nothing of love."

"See?" Aberforth shouted, brandishing his wand. "He admits it!"

"Not to all of it. You think I wish death upon your sister? Her state means more to me than you will ever understand. It represents our failure. Every fit she has pulls at my heart and makes me wonder why I wait here and do nothing."

"You don't care!" Aberforth hissed. "It's all about you and your ambitions."

"My ambitions dwarf all; everything I do is for the greater good."

Half a dozen curses leapt towards him, but Gellert cast wordless counters and they sparked out before reaching him. Another spell built in the boy's wand, but Gellert flicked his hand and knocked him flat against the grass.

"Stop this!" cried Albus, his voice cracking like weathered stone.

Aberforth sucked in a long breath, rising from the grass. "No! He dies here!"

Gellert neutralized the boy's next spell. An invisible whip cracked and the child went sprawling again. *Pathetic.* Gellert readied his wand.

The boy lunged. "AVADA---"

"CRUCIO!"

He cast without thinking, unprepared to hear the Killing Curse's first verse. The Unforgivable plucked Aberforth from mid-air. For a moment he hung --- suspended and thrashing --- before falling to the grass, writhing like a snake with its tail caught beneath a hunter's boot.

Blood thundered in Gellert's ears. *Let him suffer; let him learn what it is to play with the Unforgivable Curses.*

A rocky spire jutted up between them, breaking his concentration.

Gellert turned slowly, facing a familiar face whose wand was trained on him. "Leave."

Ice seeped through his veins. *He can't take his side.* "Did you not hear the spell your brother---"

"I said leave, Gellert. You've done enough."

*You bastard!* Something shattered inside his chest. "Our plans---"

"Can wait --- if they still go on at all. Just... go."

Silence hung between them but for their robes flapping in a late-summer's breeze. "You would abandon our ambitions?"

Pain slashed across Albus's face. "They are my family, Gellert. I can't just leave them."

"And what of the muggles who did this to your family?"

"Ariana's accident was our fault. If we had been more careful---"

"YOUR INCOMPETENCE IS NOT THE POINT!" Gellert hated him! A hundred daggers buried themselves hilt deep in his chest. *Why does it hurt so much?* He took a deep, shuddering breath. "I loved you." Silent tears stung his eyes and blurred his vision. "We were to unite the Hallows and become Masters of Death. My life's work, Albus; I was willing to share this with you."

Gellert saw the pain in his best friend's eyes, saw Albus steeling himself for what would come next. "I was mistaken to agree. I will no longer be part of your plans, Grindelwald."

The knives burned inside his chest. "Then we duel."

"No!"

*You've made your choice.* "Fight me!"

"NO!" Albus slipped his wand back up his sleeve. "Go!"

Gellert studied him, the heat still eating at his chest. "You would let me leave, knowing what I plan?"

Albus stared back at him. "Yes."

His hands curled into fists. "The weaklings will ask for your aid. We will meet again."

The wind blew strands of auburn hair across his friend's forehead. "Perhaps."

Gellert closed his eyes and snuffed the building heat. "We end this now."

"No."

"Yes." Aberforth crawled out from behind the jutting stone, clutching at the hem of his brother's robes. "Albus, listen to what he's saying. We should take him. Together, we could do it."

"No."

Gellert levelled his wand at Albus, his sister's slowly stirring body the only thing between them. "Arm yourself, Dumbledore!" Albus remained still. "Arm yourself now!"

Albus looked away. "I will not fight you, Gellert."

His heartstrings tugged. *Must I do this?* "Fine; have it your way." Gellert let his wand's tip fall, now aimed down at Ariana. "Crucio."

The girl screamed and Albus drew his wand. Gellert ended the spell. The spire exploded. Shrapnel intercepted Gellert's curses then burst into flame, pelting back towards him.

Gellert banished himself a dozen feet back and thrust his wand above his head. The fire streamed skyward, now a single molten sphere that fell towards Albus like a shooting star.

Grass burned and stone smouldered, giving way beneath the fire. A flaming tornado surrounded the spot where Albus had stood, sending waves of heat rippling out in all directions.

Gellert lowered his wand, wincing as his skin stiffened against the heat. Something panged inside his stomach, raising bile to his throat. White-hot needles prodded at his cheeks. He turned to leave. "No!" Aberforth screamed. "You bastard!"

"It is finished." Sweat rolled down Gellert's face.

"Like hell it is!"

Gellert spun and batted away the first curse. Spells flew back and forth until Aberforth was blasted back again. Gellert sneered down at him, this creature who had ruined everything. Green light seeped from the end of his wand, the curse building.

The blazing twister broke apart, sent skyward for a second time. Gellert whirled just in time to see it vanish in the waiting maw of a dragon made entirely from water, looming higher than the houses or trees. The dragon collapsed, rolling towards him in a single, destructive wave. It slammed against a silver shield that wavered. Gellert strained and grimaced.

The water reared back, once more a roaring dragon preparing to strike.

*This is no animation. This is Drochuisc*. Fear gnawed at him for the first time that day. *One of the four elemental incarnations of hatred --- I thought them no more than myths.*

Gellert grunted and slowed time.

*Thump, thump!*

Not truly, but close enough. His mind processed things inhumanly swift in this state so that everything around him appeared to crawl. It was a perilous trick and he dared only use it in times like these; when eye-blinks could be the difference between life and death.

*Thump, thump!*

*Five heartbeats --- I dare not risk longer.* His shock ebbed. *Better.* Never had he expected something like this. *If one exists, they all must.* Four meaningless incantations, or so he'd thought. *Albus has greater control than I; my counter must be swift.*

*Thump, thump!*

The world sped back up. "TALAMHOLC!"

Stones cracked with a sound like thunder and a hundred monsters crawled from the earth, made of stone and clay.

The dragon lunged but was met halfway. Gellert's face twisted with pain. It was like the spell was tearing him apart.

Gellert snarled and swept his wand outwards, forcing the spell into a solid mass of earth and stone that absorbed the dragon's strike, then curled around it. Both spells broke; sopping earth crumbled like sand at high tide and water sloshed out across the yard. Tree-sized stones hit the ground so hard it trembled, but Gellert looked past all of that.

Albus stood facing him, wand outstretched. Both of them were flushed and gasping, but Gellert attacked; a simple barrage of curses fired off in quick succession. *I cannot win a game of control; I must beat him this way.* The two exchanged curses so fast that Gellert lost track of whose spells were whose.

Footsteps pounded near. His earlier fear returned. *I must end this quickly; I cannot beat both of them.*

"AVADA KEDAVRA!"

Green light leapt hungrily from the tip of Gellert's wand, but the nearest wall split off and intercepted the spell. The stone shattered into a hundred shards that hung --- momentarily suspended between him and Albus --- some of them blazing.

Gellert dilated again, seeking gaps in the stones through which to fire curses. It was imprecise work; there was no telling whether the stones would fall faster than his spells could move.

He let the world speed up again and fired at the same time as Albus. His aim was true and sailed through a pair of stones that obscured his rival's view. A single spell slipped through a different pair of stones, hissing towards Gellert, who raised his wand.

A shrill scream filled the warm, summer air and a small body slumped against the sopping grass.

The duel ended with her heartbeat. Albus dropped his wand and lurched forward, cradling his sister's lifeless corpse. *She's dead; I saw that spell.* Albus knew it too, though Gellert knew he had not seen it. *I should kill him; he might wonder if I did it, his wrath would be fierce.*

Gellert raised his wand, aiming past the spot where Aberforth sat gaping and towards his brother's back. He could hear the words inside his head, but they melted on his tongue each time he tried saying them. *He could die never knowing that he killed her; there would be mercy in that.* Still his hand shook and now tears stung his eyes again.

*I'm sorry, Albus, for your loss and for the future. It will be harder this way.* The blue sky faded as he whirled, leaving Godric's Hollow far behind him.

***September 2, 1993***

***The Great Hall***

***8:36 AM***

Harry was accustomed to being the first awake, but Theodore had risen first that morning. Harry ignored his stare as he hurriedly dressed, preparing for breakfast. *At least he woke me before the others noticed I was still asleep.*

Harry cast his mind back to last night's vision as they moved up towards the Great Hall. *How did Skeeter get so much right?* Some of the details might be wrong, but it was incredible. *No one's known any of this for almost a hundred years, but she just fished all of it up in a few months?*

Harry moved on; some mysteries would never be solved. The duel had been incredible and he could hardly blame Grindelwald for snapping. *Merlin knows how good an agitator Aberforth is.* The only thing that bothered him was the one thing Skeeter had gotten wrong.

***The previous night...***

The pockmarked grass and sun-kissed sky faded. "You look well."

"You didn't expect me to, did you?" Harry asked, opening his eyes to see a familiar tower cell.

Grindelwald tilted his head. "I was unsure. You have changed these past months."

"It would have made me sick a year ago," said Harry, walking towards the barred window and looking out. It was a long way to the mountain's peak and further still to the waters of Lake Königssee far below it.

"And what does it do now?" Grindelwald asked, watching him, hands folded atop his chest. *It reminds me of how Dumbledore stands sometimes.*

"The Cruciatus Curse on Ariana... that was the bit I didn't like." *Only one bit that bothered me... I really am changing.* All he could do was hope it was for the best.

"It was regrettable." *He sounds like he means it.* "I administered a small fraction of the curse's power and only for a heartbeat. It was impulsive and immoral, I was not thinking clearly."

Harry shook his head. "You recovered fast. That duel... I've never seen anything like it. I wish I could fight that way. I wouldn't have to let other people control everything and just go along with it."

"You will learn." Harry nodded, still peering out the room's lone window. "You doubt me?"

His face twisted into a grimace. "Some of that magic... it just feels impossible." Harry turned back towards Grindelwald. "What is Fiendfyre?"

Grindelwald stood still. "What inspired this question?"

"You compared the water Dumbledore conjured to something you thought of as Fiendfyre, but I've never heard of it."

"I am unsurprised. It is among the most evil of magics."

*Evil? Weird word for him to use.* Harry chewed his words. "I didn't think you considered any magic evil. Haven't dark lords in the past always said magic is just magic?"

"I am no dark lord, I act for the world." Harry nodded; it's not like there was much else to do. "Their words are true, when taken in most forms. I generally believe it is the application of the thing which can be morally categorized and not the thing itself."

"But you called Fiendfyre evil?"

"I did."

"Why?"

"Fiendfyre is unlike other magic. It is autonomous. It is hatred given form; its only purpose is to destroy."

"You thought something like that about the spell you used to counter the water. Something about how much destruction it would cause if you couldn't control it."

Grindelwald rubbed at his temples. "Its function is the same. Fiendfyre, Drochuisc, Talamholc, and Sgriosàile --- the four elemental incarnations of hatred. I call them evil because, in their purest forms, they are manifestations of blind malevolence."

Harry found himself leaning forward. "But they can be controlled?"

"Only by the exceptionally skilled. They were called myths for centuries due to their scarcity. It takes a uniquely gifted magician to master any of them."

Harry imagined roaring winds buffeting wine-red fire and water surging up through broken earth. "What about all of them?"

"It is impossible."

Harry frowned. "Why?"

Grindelwald chewed his words. "Aristotle believed everything was made from elements later named for him. This is, of course, untrue, but his beliefs are not unfounded."

"What do you mean?" The best way to get answers from Grindelwald was to ask a leading question, then listen.

"It is the belief of many that magic found its roots in the creative mind. Some believe that things once sprung into being to match how we perceived the world. Those who support this idea often cite that the creation process is the root of all magic and claim that what we use today is the same force that has been weakened by time and stagnation."

Harry took that in; it was a mad idea. *It all sounds nuts.* "What do you think?"

"There is merit in the idea. Magic and its capacity to create may well be linked to the beginning of all things. I am more sceptical of the idea that it once worked so fluidly, subconscious thought brought concepts into existence, but the truth matters very little. What is important is that the Aristotelian elements are often linked back to this concept."

"Why?" Harry asked again, not yet seeing a connection.

"Because it is said certain kinds of people more often imagined, and therefore created, some elements more than others. None of this matters, in truth. It is commonly viewed as a folktale used to justify our shortcomings. The truth is that one magician can only ever wield two of them. One cannot wield opposing elements."

Harry pondered for a moment. "So if someone could use air and fire, they wouldn't be able to use earth and water?"

Grindelwald waved a hand. "Their use in most conventional magics would be unchanged, but they would be unable to wield them as incarnations of hatred."

"So your two were earth and fire?"

"Yes, my affinities were for earth and fire."

"And Dumbledore?"

"Water and earth, though I suspect that may have changed in later years."

Harry raised his eyebrows. "Affinities can change?"

"I have never known it to happen, but one's Patronus can change and that is the purest representation of the caster one can imagine."

Harry rolled his eyes. "You keep just assuming I know these spells you're talking about."

Grindelwald smiled. "I am using terminology you are unfamiliar with in the hope of fostering further questions."

*Git. At least he's honest.* "Fine. What's a Patronus?"

"A Patronus is the result of the Patronus Charm, the only known defence against dementors."

Harry perked up. "They're at Hogwarts this year."

Grindelwald unfolded his hands. "Dementors are posted at a school?"

Harry took a deep breath, trying to ignore the rage bubbling up beneath his skin. "Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban. He betrayed Dumbledore and my parents in the last war. He sold their location to Voldemort, then joined him. Some say he was his lieutenant near the end. No one knows for sure, but either way, he's dangerous; the only man ever to escape from Azkaban."

Grindelwald's eyes were like blue ice. "You ought to tell me things of this nature."

"Why?" Harry asked. "It's not like you can do anything about it whilst locked up here."

"I need not do anything at all. I need only to prepare you for what may come."

***Back in the present...***

It was hard not being happy with the talk they'd had despite how the image of Grindelwald's wand trained on Ariana made him feel. *That happened a hundred years ago, there's nothing to be done. Focus on yourself.*

The best way of serving himself was working with Grindelwald. The thought still made him nervous, but it was the only path forward. *How else will I ever get free? People using me is helping me now, but it won't always. I need power.*

Harry had said as much to Grindelwald, who had agreed to help him. *"I will help only so long as you continue making the best of my teachings. Laziness will not be tolerated --- lazy men do not change the world.*"

Grindelwald's first lecture had been on non-verbal casting. Harry was to master it by Samhain, which he thought sounded insane. *That's in the sixth-year curriculum and Cassie told me half of them struggle. How am I supposed to do it?* But he had not complained; that was another thing he doubted Grindelwald would tolerate. *At least I know some Occlumency, he said that would help.*

Timetables were soon passed around. Harry looked down at his. It was much fuller than it had been last year. *There's no way I could have taken Divination; it's literally impossible.* That first day alone, they had Transfiguration and Defence Against the Dark Arts in the morning, Care of Magical Creatures immediately after lunch, and then an Arithmancy double to end the day.

Divination would remain untaken. Harry had begun studying some Ancient Runes last year after Daphne demonstrated just how useful they could be. They proved both fascinating and versatile. *Not a subject I'd give up.* Then there was Arithmancy, a fundamental component of magic involved in things like Alchemy and Spell Creation. *I can't give that up, either.* Care of Magical Creatures was the least intriguing of the three, but with dementors at Hogwarts, it felt more important than ever. *Grindelwald can talk about Divination all he wants; I made the right choices.*

When the last of them finished breakfast, Harry and his group began moving towards the Great Hall's exit.

"Potter!"

*Must he do this on the first day?* Harry schooled his features before he turned around. *I won't give Snape any more reasons to make my life a pain.* "Professor?"

"Come." Snape strode off towards the stone steps leading into the dungeons, gesturing for him to follow.

"We'll tell McGonagall where you are," Pansy promised before moving off with Draco, Theodore, Crabbe, and Goyle.

Harry and Snape left the noise-filled hall behind. They walked in silence past the decoy corridor and the Slytherin common room, their footsteps echoing against the stone walls, floors, and ceilings until they reached Snape's office.

It was as dark and dingy a place as Harry remembered. The only noticeable difference was that Snape had acquired several more jars over the summer, each of them filled with a new slimy something Harry did not recognize.

"It is your lucky day, Potter."

*It doesn't feel like it right now.* Surely Snape would only ever say that to mock him. "What do you mean, Professor?"

Snape screwed up his face. *It's like he's trying not to curse me.* "You are an exceptional student --- exceptional enough that you are being bestowed a unique honour." His lip curled. "I personally consider this madness and think it will only inflate your ego further, but choices like these are beyond my authority."

*He's really not happy.* "What honour, sir?"

The professor waved his wand and a desk drawer slid open. Snape withdrew an odd device Harry had never seen before ---something resembling an hourglass hanging from an ornate chain. *It's mechanical though, or something like it. Weird.*

"Do you know what this is, Potter?"

"No, sir."

"This is a time turner. Its function is as advertised. Anyone in possession of this device or any like it will have, at their disposal, a mechanism capable of traversing time itself."

Awe washed over him, all semblances of Occlumency forgotten. "Sir, are you telling me this lets whoever's wearing it travel through time?"

"In a sense." *He really doesn't sound happy. Not that I can blame him --- why would anyone give these to a student?*

"Sir, do I understand right that you're going to give this to me?" Snape nodded curtly. "Why do Hogwarts students get time turners? That seems mental."

Snape's lip curled. "I'm glad to see there is still some sense left in that overinflated head of yours. Rest assured, Potter, that these are not given out lightly. You are one of two Hogwarts students this year being given one. You two will be the first students ever given these devices."

"Ever, sir?"

"Yes, Potter, ever; must I repeat myself so often?"

Harry grasped for control of his mind. *Must you be such an utter twat?* "Sorry, sir, it's just... a lot."

"These are a relatively new discovery made by the Department of Mysteries. There have been several propositions made over the past number of years for Hogwarts students to receive them, but they have all been denied." Snape looked like he was chewing on a lemon. "The Granger girl was granted one this year on the account of her wishing to take extra classes. She was deemed an exceptional student and served as an ideal opportunity for these devices to be tested in an educational setting. I was... displeased by the development."

"Because you don't think students should be given time turners?"

"I am quite correct in saying they should not be, but the bulk of my displeasure came when I heard who would be receiving one." Snape fixed him with his dark-eyed stare. "You are an attention-seeking brat completely lacking in common sense and void of any survival instincts, but it is you who stands atop your year, not Granger."

*So that's why he agreed. He can't stand Gryffindor winning, even if I gain from them not. It's so petty*, he almost laughed.

Snape lifted the time turner, but his grip around its chain remained firm. "It should go without saying that you will be monitored more closely than usual and questioned regularly about your usage of this."

Harry nodded, mind racing with a hundred new prospects. *I can really do it. Between this and Grindelwald, I can work towards being free.* "Yes, sir."

"The time turner may not be used to retake tests or exams, nor in any competitive environment such as Quidditch. If you leave the castle during the spring or winter breaks, the time turner will remain behind with me." Snape stared into his eyes. "Am I understood?"

Harry nodded. "Yes, sir."

"I should dissuade any delusions you may have about bending time to your whims before you try something foolish. The time turner works safely only in one-hour increments. One full turn of the hourglass will transport you back one hour into the past, and back is the only direction you can travel." Harry nodded to show that he was following.

"I am legally bound to inform you that this device should only be used in order to attend extra classes and complete the necessary course material," Snape's lip curled again, "but I am not foolish enough to believe you will follow such restrictions. Instead I will tell you that those who meddle with time rarely find kind fates. No one has travelled further back than six hours. Seven is theoretically possible, but you would be a greater fool than even your father if you tried."

"So only go back a few hours at a time, at most?"

"At most. This is not a toy, Potter, and it has other consequences."

*Here comes the catch.* "What sorts of consequences, Professor?"

"The time turner allows you to be in two places simultaneously. If you travel back in time, two of you will exist before the past version of yourself takes the time turner back, as you did."

Harry swallowed hard. *This sounds like one of Dudley's cartoons.* "I'm guessing I probably don't want to run into the duplicate of myself?"

"Doing so would be ill-thought. You should also avoid others realizing there are two of you. No one is to know of this, not even your closest friends."

*It's weird agreeing with Snape, but he's right about that part. Draco would probably go run his mouth about it.* "I understand."

"There is more than the possibility of colliding with an alternative version of yourself. The time turner does not duplicate you. It instead divides, leaving your mind and body reeling under twice the strain. This is the price you pay for time."

*That could be a problem.*

"I'm warning you, Potter, misuse of this device will be severely punished."

Harry nodded one last time, reaching out as Snape finally handed him the time turner, its metal cold against his skin. "I understand, sir."

***That evening...***

Hermione's eyelids drooped, the scarlet curtains flickering in and out of sight as she scratched Crookshanks behind the ear. Her head lulled and the necklace swung, its metal cold against her skin.

That was what jolted her. She cupped the hourglass and held it up to her face, staring down and battling the storm raging inside her.

*This is stupid! This is so stupid! Why is everything in this world stupid!* The Philosopher's Stone left in a school, aurors uninvolved in fighting threats against children, dementors at Hogwarts, and now this? *How am I ever supposed to be comfortable in a world that makes no sense? Everything is broken!*

Hardly anything worked the way it should. Couldn't they all see that? Couldn't the adults do something about it? Almost everything needed fixing and the world would operate a whole lot smoother if people just slowed down and used basic common sense.

But on the other hand...

A time turner, resting in the palm of her hand. *I can do things with this... so much is possible.* She almost gasped, struck by sudden inspiration. *This is it! This is my chance! I can use this. I'll use it to get ahead --- so far ahead that, by the time I graduate, they'll have to listen*. There was hope yet --- if no one else would fix things, then Hermione would do it herself.

***September 3, 1993***

***The Headmaster's Office***

***8:00 PM***

Harry examined his own emotions as he climbed the spiral staircase. Pleasant memories came with this climb, but so too did knowing long-buried secrets. *Why does what he did that summer bug me more than what Grindelwald did?* It all came back to treachery. *Dumbledore was willing to leave his family... I could never do that.*

"Enter," Dumbledore called once Harry knocked upon his door. The office remained unchanged but for the headmaster's desk, upon which lay the largest pile of parchment Harry had ever seen.

"Busy start to your year, sir?" he asked, taking the seat across from Dumbledore.

Dumbledore shoved aside a sheet of parchment. "You could say that, yes. Dementors on the grounds of Hogwarts come with much paperwork. Funny that the one tasked with said work is the one who opposed their presence from the beginning."

"My friends said you wouldn't like dementors at Hogwarts. They were surprised to see them here at all."

A shadow passed across Dumbledore's face. "They were correct. I have no love for beasts who know nothing but treachery and despair. Cornelius\'s assurances do little to appease me."

"Do you think the dementors are working with Black, or something?"

The headmaster's lips thinned. "No. The dementors will not spare Sirius Black, not now that he has escaped. I doubt even Lord Voldemort could convince them otherwise."

*Careful with this next one.* "But you think Voldemort is coming back?"

Dumbledore looked old all of a sudden. "I believe that his return is inevitable, whenever it may come." He peered out his office window towards the clear night sky. "I fear that day of reckoning may not be so distant. There have been rumblings."

*Dumbledore really doesn't miss much.* Harry hoped he remained ignorant. Things could get very complicated if Dumbledore learned of Voldemort's return. *Caught between the two most powerful wizards in the world... that doesn't sound fun.*

"I believe that's enough talk of dementors and Voldemort," Dumbledore decided. "We have much to discuss. How has your return to classes treated you?"

"We haven't done much except for Divination and Care of Magical Creatures yesterday, plus a double period in Potions earlier today."

"What do you think of your new classes? I heard that Silvanus began his class this year with hippogriffs; such beautiful creatures, they are."

Harry smiled in memory. "It was my favourite class so far. Crabbe thought he might be starting us too fast, but it all worked out."

"Professor Kettleburn has always been fond of grand beginnings. I eagerly await the stories of each new year. What of the others?"

Harry chewed his lip. "I don't know about Divination." That was a lie. *I know it's a complete and total waste of time with that idiot teaching.* All she had done was predict his death by staring into some tea leaves. *Even Grindelwald thinks she's a joke.*

"It has never been my favourite subject." Harry remembered Dumbledore saying that while talking with Grindelwald and suppressed a shudder. "Not many have the gift. Do not take any failures too harshly, and do try and forgive Sybil's eccentricities. She is a kind-hearted woman who means well."

"Yes, sir." There was nothing else to say. *I'll just keep my insults nonverbal.*

"Divination took place during the same time as Arithmancy yesterday, did it not?" Harry nodded. "So you have used the time turner?"

"I did. It was... weird."

"Is it true that those who use them feel no connection to their alternative self?"

"If Snape hadn't told me how it worked---"

"Professor Snape, Harry."

Harry's eye twitched, but went on. "If Professor Snape hadn't told me how it worked, I would never have realized there was another one of me at all." A grimace marred his face. "Until that night. I crashed really hard."

Dumbledore nodded. "That is unsurprising. Professor Snape and I are of the belief that Occlumency can be used to augment your mind in a way that may lessen the strain it undergoes."

"Thought streams, right?"

"Your knowledge has expanded since last we met."

Harry wanted to curse the moment the question left his lips. *Idiot! Voldemort is the one who mentioned that!* "I read about them this summer. There are a few books on it in the Black family library."

"I see." Harry tried gauging Dumbledore's mood, but it was impossible. "I should have known curiosity would get the best of you. Your Occlumency is impressive for one so young. You continued the prescribed exercises over the summer?"

"Yes, sir. They've been helping; I can feel the difference."

"Good. I will no longer keep Passive Occlumency from you, but I do ask that attempted alterations of your own mind be done only while instructed and supervised until you have a grasp on the necessary concepts."

Harry fought a smile. *I'll have supervision, it might just not be what you have in mind.* "Of course, sir."

"I was referring to thought streams, as you guessed. They are, at first, exhausting, but become much less so with time. We believe their usage may reduce the strain caused by the time turner."

"So are we going to test the theory?"

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "You will be testing it later this year so long as you gain proficiency with the technique, though I am afraid I will not be aiding you."

Harry frowned. "But you just asked me not to do those sorts of things without proper instruction."

"And you will have it, just not from me. I will be passing the duty of teaching you Occlumency onto Professor Snape this year."

Harry stiffened. "What? But, sir---"

Dumbledore held up a hand. "Please let me explain." Harry reluctantly sat back in his chair. "Professor Snape is more gifted an occlumens than I will ever be. I feared him too impatient to instruct a beginner, but you are past that stage now. I believe he will be a better instructor than I. It would be selfish of me not to do what I feel is best for you."

"What if I'd still prefer you teach me? Headmaster, you must know that he and I don't get along."

"I am not unaware. It is another reason why I believe this to be wise."

Harry chose his next words carefully. "Sir, I don't mean to be rude, but that sounds completely backwards."

"Does it? We have already discussed Voldemort's inevitable return. Both you and Professor Snape have strong reasons to oppose him. Is it not wise ensuring the two of you can coexist before that trying day comes?"

Guilt clawed at his stomach, but he batted it away. *You're doing what's best for you. That's it. There's nothing wrong with that.* "I guess so, sir."

"Fear not, I won't neglect you this year. We will continue our lessons, they will simply cease being focused on Occlumency."

Harry perked back up. "What will you be teaching me, sir?"

"It is my hope that I will teach you how better to handle yourself in the event that Sirius Black or similarly interested parties gain access to you."

Harry's eyes lit up. "You're going to teach me how to fight?"

"Slowly but surely. We will begin with me teaching you Transfiguration and see how much of the curriculum we can get through. I believe you are ahead already?"

Harry nodded. "I'm probably somewhere into the fourth-year curriculum. I haven't pushed myself as hard in Transfiguration as I have in something like Defence Against the Dark Arts."

"All the better. All it means is that you do not yet understand your potential. I think you will soon surprise yourself."

**Author's Endnote:**

**I can see you all typing away about how foolish it is to include time turners and I understand your concern. They are beyond broken canonically. That is one of the reasons I am including them --- I want to see if I can provide at least a little bit of balance and logic to something so broken. You can see the foundations of that balance in this chapter already. I will promise right now that time turners will not become a major plot device, and that you will not see any moments of import suddenly undone. Their inclusion is a personal challenge to myself; that's really about it.**

**I should also point out that, due to his year-long stay in Azkaban, Hagrid did not get the Care of Magical Creatures position. There's no good way of explaining that in-world since, from the characters' perspectives, him not getting it is normal so they have no reason to ponder it.**

***September 6, 1993***

***The Great Hall***

***12:11 PM***

Harry felt energized at lunch when he entered the Great Hall flanked by Theodore and Pansy. Their last lesson before lunch had been Charms and Harry had stayed behind to ask some more advanced questions. Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle had gone on ahead, but Theodore and Pansy had waited.

Harry and the others had entered that morning to find a blazing sun smiling down at them from the enchanted ceiling far above. It was the first bit of sun any of them had seen since their arrival at Hogwarts. Harry had heard some students muttering about how the dementors had brought with them a perpetual downpour of rain and gloom.

Between the bright weather and their last Charms lesson, Harry was feeling better than he had in days. Flitwick was one of the first professors to let them cast magic instead of slogging through reviews of last year's curriculum, or in the case of Harry's new classes, teaching the basics.

*Or doing whatever the hell Trelawney's doing. What a waste of time. I'd feel cheated if I didn't get a time turner...* Snape had wanted him to take all the classes, but he had refused to sit through Muggle Studies. They had argued, but Harry had won. His four classes were still impossible without the time turner, so there hadn't been much Snape could say. *Guess it means I can't drop Divination, though. Pity.*

Harry's eyes sought out Granger. She was sitting with Weasley and looked unchanged. *Figures, the year's barely started.* It would be interesting to watch the strain on her this year. *She's taking more classes than me and probably doesn't know Occlumency. We'll see how worth it these time turners are.*

"What took you so long?" Draco asked once Harry took his seat.

"I was just asking Flitwick something about a spell we'll learn later this year."

"What was it?"

Harry frowned. *Weird, Draco's never been interested in this stuff.* "I know we'll learn the Cheering Charm this year, so I asked if there was a spell that did the opposite. I think it was the dementors that made me think of it."

Draco pushed away his half-eaten plate. "And what did he say?"

"He said we won't be learning any charms like that."

Draco scowled. "So he didn't answer the question."

"Not really, but I bet there is. He would have just said no if not."

"There is," Theodore said quietly. "It's a curse, not a charm. I'm not surprised Flitwick didn't tell you."

"How do you know that?" Draco asked, his scowl deepening.

Theodore looked around, ensuring others were occupied in their own discussions. "I don't know the incantation or what it's actually called, but Father's always called it the Suicide Curse." Hairs stood up on the back of Harry's neck. *This sounds lovely...* "Grindelwald made it famous in the twenties and thirties. It's how he got rid of a bunch of high-ranking officials who opposed him."

Harry kept his composure, but barely. *Why does that surprise me? Why does every awful thing I hear about Grindelwald surprise me?* Was it because of seeing his past? Had Harry grown too close to him? Had he begun overlooking everything he had done? *I'll get more context soon; he'll definitely show me stuff from the war.*

Draco twirled a fork between his fingers. "I've never heard of it."

"I'm not surprised. I don't recall you having ancestors who fought on Grindelwald's side."

Harry nearly dropped his own fork. *The Notts fought for Grindelwald? Why?* They were among the harshest blood supremacists in Britain and Grindelwald viewed all magicians as equals. *They must have seen an advantage in it somewhere. I'll ask Grindelwald about it; that and the Suicide Curse.*

"If you're all quite finished," said Pansy, sliding back into her spot beside Harry, who blinked; he hadn't realised she had left. "I have gossip."

Draco rolled his eyes. "You always have gossip. No offence, but I personally don't care who was caught in a broom cupboard by the patrols last night."

Pansy sneered at him. "I'll have you know that no one was caught last night, thank you very much, and that this gossip is more up your alley."

"Go on, then," Draco said with a long, suffering sigh. Harry bit his tongue. *He really is a jerk to Pansy. I know he's joking a lot of the time, but he never shuts up.*

"We're going to be fighting boggarts today."

Draco really did drop his fork and Theodore nearly cut himself with the knife he was holding. "What?" he asked, putting the knife aside.

"That's what Lupin has done so far with all the third years. We have his class today, don't we?"

"Right after lunch," Harry confirmed, mind racing.

"A boggart?" Theodore asked, casting his eyes about the Great Hall. *It's like he's looking for a way out.* "Is he mad?"

"He's something," sneered Draco. "I doubt anyone who dresses like that can be sensible."

Harry looked away, remembering the rags he'd worn on Privet Drive. *No. That's over, you're never going back. Think about other things.* The first thing he thought about was fighting a boggart; that was hardly any better.

"How's it going to work?" Theodore asked Pansy. "Are we going to wait out in the hall or something while one of us fights the boggart at a time?"

Pansy chewed her lip. "The others all fought the boggart in the same room, one after the other. They're all talking about each others' fears."

Harry imitated Draco in sneering. *Bloody hell, he really is mad.*

***About an hour later, in the Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom...***

Lupin's classroom was more like Aberforth's than Quirrell's. The walls were bare and his desk was empty but for a stack of parchment. The curtains were pulled back and sunlight spilled through the large glass windows, leaving bright pools on the otherwise empty walls.

Lupin shuffled some parchment then set it down atop his desk. Draco had a point; never had Harry seen a professor look so unfit for the job. His robes were tattered and fraying at the edges, all colour long lost from them. His skin was thin and pale, his hair patched and greying.

Lupin had hardly finished taking the roll when Theodore's hand went up. Lupin raised an eyebrow and pointed to him. "I've heard a rumour that you plan to have us face a boggart."

The professor furrowed his brow. "Whoever passed it along is well-informed."

"So it's true?"

"That's the plan for today, yes."

"Isn't that unsafe?" Greengrass asked.

*Here we go.* Harry sat back and watched. Lupin frowned. "Unsafe?"

"Being thrown at a boggart just seems extreme. What happens if someone reacts poorly? What happens if the experience leads to trauma?"

Harry resisted the urge to glare. *Why must I agree with her? Why can't she just be wrong for once in her life?*

Lupin looked unperturbed. "Boggarts can elicit some strong reactions, but that's exactly why I think it's important to cover them."

Greengrass chewed her lip. "That sounds somewhat counterintuitive, Professor."

"Does it? I would think you'd rather first meet a boggart in a classroom than at random whilst unprepared." Greengrass had no answer for that. "Are there any other objections?"

"I heard you made the others face the boggart in front of the class," said Theodore.

Lupin's lips thinned. "I did."

"I won't do that."

The professor shrugged. "I can't force you to. You may leave if you'd like, but it will be covered on the end-of-year exam and you may want the preparation."

"You really mean to have us face our darkest fears in front of the entire class?" Draco asked with his trademark sneer. "Do you realize how dimwitted that is?"

Lupin appeared frustrated now, fingering the tears along the edges of his robe. "Have you ever thought to consider that I might have my own reasons for overlooking those risks?"

"Did you ever stop to consider that some of us may actually have gone through traumatic experiences we don't want others knowing about?" Greengrass asked.

"I will not have any of you face a boggart alone." Lupin's tone became sharp for the first time. "I understand why some of you may be concerned, but this is the only way I feel comfortable conducting this lesson.

"The more of you there are on hand, the more confused the boggart will be." Greengrass backed down again. Draco muttered something about his father under his breath. "Tell him if you wish," said Lupin, "I'm sure he knows that boggarts rarely take the forms of more serious fears." Harry blinked. *How the hell did he hear that?*

"What do you mean?" Greengrass asked.

"Boggarts become a manifestation of fear, but not always the fear itself. It's easy for a boggart to become a spider when faced with someone who's arachnophobic. It's harder for a boggart to match deeper fears like failure because that doesn't have a single form. I think some of you might be surprised at how little your boggarts actually give away."

Lupin offered them all one final chance to leave. When no one took it, he led them into the staff room. It was large, dark with its curtains drawn and empty but for the class and a cabinet that rattled violently when they entered.

Harry eyed the cabinet. *What is my boggart*? The question had plagued him since lunch, but he had no answers.

Years ago it would have been Vernon, but he was past that now. Many children may fear Voldemort, but Harry knew his boggart would not be the Dark Lord. *Wylla Nurmen, maybe? That feels more like what it would have been last year.*

Harry still had no inkling by the time Millicent Bulstrode faced the boggart. It became a bloodless corpse, its eyes dark, chalk-white hands outstretched. Davis's boggart was a pair of dead bodies belonging to two people who could only be her parents, whilst Moon's became a rabid werewolf.

Harry was beginning to realize by the time the first of his friends moved forward that he would face the boggart unaware. *It doesn't matter; I got* *through Privet Drive, this will be nothing.*

Harry had just enough time to see crimson eyes frame a snake-like face before Lupin stepped in front of Goyle and the boggart became something round and silver. *The moon? Why would he be afraid of the moon*. The better question was why Goyle would be afraid of Voldemort. *I expected people would, but not purebloods whose parents were probably Death Eaters.*

The line of students thinned. Pansy's boggart was tame after Goyle's --- herself, but skeletally thin and wearing robes that made Lupin look well-dressed. Zabini was next, faced with the corpse of a beautiful woman.

Theodore hid a snicker. "The Black Widow's son is afraid of his mother's death? How ironic."

Crabbe's boggart was taller and bulkier than he was, but it resembled him so closely that Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was afraid of himself. Then he realized it must be his father. He made fists so tight that his nails bit at his palms.

This he could empathize with. *It would have been my guardians if we did this two years ago*. A sick part of him was glad, not for Crabbe's pain, but for his own empathy. *I'm changing, but not in bad ways. I can still feel sorry for people --- Grindelwald isn't brainwashing me, or anything.*

Crabbe's hand shook so violently that his wand looked fit to fall from loosely clutching fingers. *It's like when the dementor walked in.* Harry wondered how many dementors Lupin had seen in these lessons. *Not that it will be mine... that whole thing still makes no sense.*

"Next!" Lupin called, realizing Crabbe's plight. Harry stepped forward, but Draco was faster. His legs trembled, but his head remained high. *His might be a dementor,* Harry thought, but then dismissed it. *Probably upsetting his father, or something.*

The boggart was at least as tall as Lucius, but its hair and eyes were too dark, its skin too pale.

Harry restrained a gasp --- Draco's boggart was Tom Riddle.

Draco's arm halted, his wand half-raised. Riddle smiled, holding up his hand. A ring gleamed on his finger, etched with something Harry could not read, blinded by torchlight sparkling off a deep, green emerald.

"RIDDIKULUS!" Blue flashed so brightly that, for a moment, Harry could see nothing at all. When it faded, Riddle remained, kneeling at Draco's feet with his head bowed and wearing house-elf garb.

*Riddle... Draco's afraid of Riddle*. What did that mean? Was it just because of how close they'd come to death, or was there more?

*"Boggarts become a manifestation of fear, but not always the fear itself. It's easy for a boggart to become a spider when faced with someone who's arachnophobic. It's harder for a boggart to match deeper fears like failure because that doesn't have a single form. I think some of you might be surprised at how little your boggarts give away."*

*It could mean a hundred things.*

Harry leant forward when Greengrass faced the boggart. It still sickened him just looking at her. If the last year had taught him anything, it was how much he loathed treachery. *Not to mention she tried killing me... I'll get her for that.*

A young girl screamed, pulling out clumps of brown hair whilst her face twisted in agony. Greengrass waved her wand and there was a flash of blue light, then the girl was smiling, the light of laughter in her eyes. *She looks familiar.*

"Her sister," Pansy whispered in his ear. She had come back around after facing her boggart.

Harry could have smacked himself. That was where he had seen her. *So what? She's afraid of her sister being in pain?* Something told him that was wrong and that this was another less literal boggart. *She didn't want me seeing it, that must be why she pressed Lupin so hard.* A smile split his face. *That's it, that's how I get back at her.* It would need more thought. *I won't hurt a little girl, but there must be another way.*

Theodore moved towards the boggart, his footsteps echoing in the otherwise silent room. He was the final student in line aside from Harry. *What is his boggart? He looks awful.*

The boggart changed. Hovering just feet from Theodore was a green skull from whose mouth protruded a serpent --- Theodore's worst fear was the Dark Mark.

*Why? His father's a Death Eater, he admitted it himself. That makes no sense.*

The dark mark contorted and became discoloured until it was a pale cloud drifting through the dark staff room.

Harry drew his wand. *Let's see what it is, then.*

Lupin stepped between him and the cloud. There was a flash of blue light, then the boggart was gone. "It seems that I've misjudged the time," the professor said, his smile strained. "You all did excellent. There will be no homework today."

Harry felt the stares on his back when they left the room. *Let them stare.* Lupin must have thought his boggart would be Voldemort given his past. Not facing it would make the exam more difficult, but he hardly minded. Seeing the livid look on Greengrass's face when the lesson ended was worth it.

*How does it feel when things don't go your way, Greengrass?* Curiosity gnawed at him despite the victory. *I wonder what it would have been.*

***September 9, 1993***

***The Headmaster's Office***

***8:30 PM***

Ron looked around the circular room, hardly believing he was here. *I doubt even Fred and George have been here*. Percy --- perfect, Head Boy Percy --- probably had been, but it was something to rub in the twins' faces later.

A soft squawk drew Ron's attention. He actually jumped when he saw the phoenix lift its head.

Dumbledore chuckled from behind his desk. "Fawkes inspires the most delightful reactions."

Ron blushed furiously. "I thought he was a statue," he mumbled. The bird had been soundless and sleeping not a heartbeat before.

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "That is certainly a first. Thank you for bringing me something unique. I'm so rarely surprised in my old age --- and when I am, the surprise is usually of the unpleasant variety."

Ron grasped for words. "Uh... you're welcome, sir."

"I think we have talked enough about birds and surprises. Come, take a seat." Ron obliged him, suddenly wary. *What does he want? I haven't done anything.*

"You aren't in trouble," Dumbledore said as if reading his mind. "Quite the opposite."

*Huh?* "The opposite?"

"Quite. I have heard some worrying third-hand accounts involving you and wanted to ask after you."

Ron screwed up his face and thought. The answer came fast. "Lupin told you?" he asked. "He said he wouldn't, he swore no one else..." Ron trailed off when Dumbledore raised a hand for silence.

"It is Professor Lupin. Always address people by their correct names, Master Weasley."

Ron's blush returned. "Sorry."

"It is a lesson many young people must learn; you are not the first and you will not be the last. You can take solace in knowing that Professor Lupin did not tell me about the events of your first practical lesson in Defence Against the Dark Arts."

Ron wracked his brain, trying to think of who may have told Dumbledore. The possibilities were disturbingly numerous. Most of Gryffindor House had been talking about it, sans a few girls who mocked Hermione for her boggart --- herself, puffy-eyed and dressed in tattered robes. That had confused Ron. She said it had nothing to do with being poor but wouldn't explain. *Girls.*

Not that he could judge anyone --- his boggart had reminded him of that in the most painful way possible.

***Earlier that week...***

Ron wondered, not for the first time, what it meant to be brave. Gryffindors were supposed to be bold and courageous, but his knees were shaking and he felt anything but brave.

Thinking about what was coming just made it worse. That horrible cold, those rattling breaths, that slimy grey hand that had protruded from the monster's sleeve...

The boggart began changing and Ron readied himself. *How the hell do I make a dementor funny? I'm not ready! I...*

Someone screamed. Hermione stared up at him through lifeless eyes. Ron stared back, his jaw agape. The front of her robes were drenched in blood, its crimson fingers reaching out across the floor. The wound was in her chest --- a gaping, sword-shaped wound that had already killed her. *Just like it killed Luna... just like I killed Luna...*

Ron gasped for air. It felt like he was flailing beneath icy water while he tried gathering his thoughts. *It's not real! It's not real! It's not real!*

How could one find humour in death? How could anyone think of something to laugh at whilst staring their greatest failure in its lifeless face? Ron's lips moved, but no words came out. His arm began dropping, the room spun past him, torches whirling past his eyes.

"Riddikulus."

Ron stumbled back from the flash of blue light only to find that Lupin had stepped between him and the boggart and was now forcing it back into the cabinet.

The fear was gone, but there was no relief. Ron thought he would rather face the boggart ten more times than feel how he felt now. Nothing was worse than knowing he had failed again.

***Back in the present...***

"I see that you're confused," said Dumbledore, bringing Ron's attention back to the present. "There is no need for you to puzzle out the truth, I intend to tell it to you."

Ron blinked. "You do?"

Dumbledore smiled. "I can hardly expect you to be honest if I myself sit across from you on a throne made from secrets."

Fawkes let out a trill that clawed at Ron's heart. It was cold and unlike the music felt down in the Chamber of Secrets. Guilt twisted at his stomach, but there was nothing to be guilty for. "What was that?"

Dumbledore looked ten years older. "A reminder."

*Barmy, he is. Brilliant, but barmy. "*I, uh, don't mean to be rude, but why am I here?"

"Ah yes, we have strayed from the topic at hand. My apologies. I have never been good at staying topical." Dumbledore slid his half-moon spectacles down his nose and peered at Ron. "I was told about your boggart by Professor McGonagall, who was in turn told by Miss Granger."

Ron jolted. "Hermione?"

"She worries for you. Most children your age fear mundane things they may one day grow out of. What that boggart became is something darker, the root of scars that may never heal. Miss Granger was right to worry."

"So what?" Ron asked, his hands moving restlessly in his lap. "Are you gonna ask me what it means or something?"

"Heavens no. I can guess what it means, but my interpretation matters little and it is not my place to ask such questions. I will listen and offer advice if you ask for it, but I will not press you. I want only to know how you're handling the events of the past two years." His expression soured. "I ought to have had this talk with you long ago. You have my sincerest apologies for overlooking the traumatic end of your first year. That was callous of me."

Ron had been unprepared for this. *What am I supposed to say?* Dumbledore was a mythical figure like Circe or Merlin. "Thanks, sir, but I don't think there's anything you can do. It's just... hard."

"May I ask a potentially invasive question that you are under no obligation to answer?" Ron nodded; what else was he going to do? "What is it that troubles you most?"

Ron's answer was immediate and painful. "That I could have saved them."

Dumbledore closed his eyes; he looked even older now. "You could not have saved them."

"Maybe not Neville," Ron admitted, remembering the true tale of his old friend's death --- a tale that Dumbledore thought he knew not. "I could have saved Luna, though."

Dumbledore opened his eyes; they were wet and filled with sadness. "I was not in the Chamber of Secrets, so I will not argue. I will say only this. Those who experience loss often wonder what they could have done. Your mind might conjure a hundred ideas, but they are nothing more than dreams. Anyone who is good and kind must know they did all they could. It is hard, but necessary. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live."

*This is why Dumbledore's so great.* He was wiser than any man Ron had ever known. *I'd be dumb not to ask while I'm here.* "What would you do if you were me?"

"I would not dwell on those dreams, but I would hold onto them and remember what the lost meant to me. Think of them during times of need and continue forward. Light can be found even in the darkest of places. Remember that, Ronald, it is of the utmost importance."

***Meanwhile, in the dungeons...***

Tonight was Harry's first Occlumency lesson with Snape and he couldn't quite decide how he felt. Harry was ready to endure the worst Snape had to offer, but still he was excited. The prospect of reduced strain was becoming more welcome with each passing day --- a night had yet to pass without Harry completely crashing.

Someone moved behind him and Harry turned, wand raised and ready for Greengrass, one of her plans, or even Sirius Black.

"I should probably have warned you I was coming up behind you."

Harry glared at Theodore. "Do that next time."

"I'll keep it in mind." The pair fell into step together. "Where are you off to?"

A sigh escaped his lips. "Snape's office."

"Lucky you."

Harry grimaced. "I'm supposed to learn something interesting, but we'll see."

The two plunged deeper into the dungeons, nearing the dark room Snape called his office. Harry waited. Theodore was pondering something and would speak when he was ready; Harry knew that about him by now.

"Why did Lupin stop you from facing the boggart?"

Harry took a few more steps before he answered. "He never told me."

"But you know, don't you?"

Harry mussed his hair. "I think he expected it to be the Dark Lord."

Silence hung between them. "Would it have been?"

Harry cast a handful of detection charms under his breath, but they were alone. "You think I would have accepted a truce if I was that afraid?"

Theodore shrugged. "It would be a good way to stay safe."

"It would be a good way to get betrayed." Harry forced himself not to shudder. "I guess that might still happen, but here's hoping." *I just need to buy time. One day, I'll be strong.*

Theodore shook his head. "The Dark Lord would be mad to betray you. He understands what kind of ally you could be."

*Do you understand that, Theodore?* Harry wondered. *Is that why you've been so involved lately*? Things had begun adding up. First the book of Nott family magic, then continuously choosing him in small ways over Draco, then his attentiveness to the smallest of Harry's needs.

Harry rid himself of those thoughts. *Don't be so paranoid, you're friends.* "What about yours?" he asked.

"My what?"

"Your boggart. It was the Dark Mark, but I don't understand why."

Theodore's next step was awkward and he nearly stumbled. "The Dark Lord... wasn't pleased with those who used the Imperius Defence," he said. "He saw it as a sign of disloyalty. I still worry that he might snap at Father."

*Liar.* Harry knew not why he was so sure, but he was. *There's something more he isn't telling me.* There was no point in prying; Theodore would reveal no more than he had already. *Add it to the list*, he thought, remembering the other fears he would be investigating.

Hermione strained to watch him through the crowd, marked by a head of unruly black hair. A first year squeaked when she shoved him roughly aside, but she paid him no heed. "Potter!"

His steps stuttered and he glanced over his shoulder, fingers flexing. "Granger?"

"Can I have a word?"

Surprise passed across his face, but not for long. "Sure. Follow me."

They wove through the bustling crowd on its way down to dinner and around the next bend, through a tapestry Hermione had never noticed and into a secret passageway hidden behind it. The crowd's bustling was still audible, but muffled by the walls and tapestry.

"This good enough?" She nodded. "All right, then. What was it you wanted?"

Hermione reached beneath the collar of her robes and withdrew the golden hourglass. "You have one of these." It was not a question.

She waited for him to fidget, but instead he smiled. "Caught on, have you?"

She narrowed her eyes. *Is he mocking me? I can't tell.* "I noticed the first week, but wanted to be sure." She crossed her arms, frustration mounting when his smile turned anger. Her cheeks flushed with sudden knowing."You knew I had one!"

His smile faltered. Now he ran a hand through his hair, finally discomforted. *Good.* "Snape told me the day I got mine."

*That's horribly unfair!* Professor McGonagall had made no mention of another time turner inside Hogwarts. She scowled; it was just another example of Snape's blatant favouritism.

Her scowl deepened. "How do you look so calm? This is insane!"

His expression smoothed. "Yeah," he admitted, shifting from foot to foot. "That's about what I thought when Snape gave me the time turner."

"That's it? You just thought it was insane and moved on?"

His look made her eye twitch, the look of someone inspecting a slow child. "Granger, what else was I supposed to do? I wasn't going to complain and give it back."

"It doesn't bother you that they'll just give these out to children?" She placed her hands on her hips, glaring slightly up at him. "What about the dementors, or the blood supremacy, or everything else wrong?"

His face twitched but he hid his thoughts well. *Too well,* she thought, resisting a shiver. *That's not natural.*

"It bothers me," he admitted. "Less the time turners and more some of the other things, but we're students. We can't do anything yet."

Her heart quickened, visions of change swimming behind her eyes. "Do you think things can be changed? Do you think people like us can make this world make any sense?"

Potter appeared to chew his words, his face void of all emotion. "There are always ways to change things, but they're usually messy."

**Harry Potter and the Perversion of Purity**

**Book 3: The Looming of Shadows**

**Chapter 11: Looming Clouds**

***September 2, 1899***

***Cairo, Egypt***

***8:33 PM***

Gellert appeared surrounded by sprawling sands and blood-red skies. The air was thick and humid, but the burning heat was retreating with the slowly setting sun. Long shadows lounged in the sand as the sun neared the horizon, making the few buildings Gellert could see far off in the distance look like shadowed peaks rising up to hide the glowing star.

Gellert glared up at the sky. Anything resembling blood would set him off. Blood was what he should have shed two weeks ago. *It will be worse now.*

He had fled England following his duel with Albus and slunk around the German countryside whilst deciding where next to go. That part of his plan remained unchanged. *I must be prepared, both for Albus and for conquest. I cannot fail, the greater good dies with me.*

It would be better once that final battle came. *It will be kinder. Albus will no longer wonder and the world will be rebuilt. All I must do is win.*

Gellert recalled the duel for what must have been the thousandth time. His findings were the same. *Albus was more skillful.* Gellert had been more seasoned and a better traditional duellist, but Albus's control over elaborate magic was something Gellert had never seen. *And there is Drochuisc. How did he come to know it?*

It mattered not. They would fight again and experience would no longer be on his side. Age would even out that field. *I must win in other ways, learn magics beyond imagination and come armed with the ultimate weapon*.

That journey started here, amidst what remained of a once-great empire. *No stone will remain unturned. I must win. Everything depends on that victory.*

"Did you really believe you'd win?" Harry asked once the familiar cell came into focus.

Grindelwald's expression remained smooth and unreadable. "Why do you ask this? You experienced my thoughts as clearly as I once did. You know the answer."

"It just seems weird. You admitted to yourself that Dumbledore was more skilled and even that your only real advantage wouldn't matter by the time you fought again."

"One does not chase the things I sought without confidence. My doubts about beating Albus came mostly in those early days. I grew surer of the outcome as the years aged. You will understand this in time."

"But you were never positive. They say you never dared attack Britain so long as Dumbledore lived."

"I never feared Albus. I was wary of him, just as he was of me. You forget that he never pursued me in all the years I reigned. Not until inaction would have shamed him."

Harry frowned. "So both of you felt the same?"

"We knew better than any what we were capable of. I knew Albus had affinities I would never have and he knew the same. I knew that he had once been more skillful, whilst he had heard rumours that I possessed the very weapon we once sought as children."

"The Elder Wand?" Harry asked, suddenly breathless. "You actually found it?"

"It was my life's work," Grindelwald said as though it was the simplest thing in the world.

"Where is it?" Harry asked, eyes wide.

This was what he needed! If the tale was true, then this would be an unbeatable wand! Harry could take revenge against Black, establish himself in the wizarding world, and even match the likes of Voldemort.

"I am unsure what became of it."

Harry's stomach dropped. "Unsure?"

"It is difficult tracing an artifact most believe to be mythology whilst trapped in a cell."

"But Dumbledore would know, wouldn't he?"

Grindelwald's expression was unreadable. "Albus would never have claimed the wand."

"But you two---"

"Those discussions were the fantasies of children. Albus was always more interested in the stone. The wand would have repulsed him by the time we fought. I am sure he discarded it."

Harry's hands twitched. *That would be stupid.* "But wouldn't that be dangerous? That wand is supposed to be unbeatable."

"Yet Albus defeated me."

Harry frowned; his mind had skipped that detail. "How?"

"The wand does not make one invincible. Its long and bloody history speaks volumes of just how vulnerable one wielding it becomes."

"But you still wanted it."

"I was naïve. If I could do it all again, I would leave the wand untouched. I beg you not to make my old mistakes."

Harry nodded, but said nothing. *I never swore I would*. Whether Grindelwald had lost or not, the wand still sounded like just the thing he needed.

"I have something else to ask of you before I field more questions."

*Something to ask of me? He hardly ever asks things of me.* Harry's palms grew sweaty. "What is it?"

"Do not ask Albus about the wand. It would pain him. Let the matter lie."

Harry reluctantly nodded. *It's not like he would answer anyway*. "Can I ask other questions now?"

Grindelwald smiled thinly. "Of course."

"A friend of mine at school is named Theodore Nott. He said one of his ancestors worked with you."

"A Cantankerus Nott worked under me for a time."

Harry recognized the name. *Theodore's great grandfather; the one who wrote the Sacred Twenty-Eight*. "Theodore mentioned a spell a few days ago that you used to get rid of important people. He called it the Suicide Curse."

"Many did. The name was apt. I will show you my discovery of the spell soon. You may ask questions once I have."

Annoyance rose, but he forced it down and remained still. Arguing would not get him what he wanted. *Grindelwald's set in his ways, he won't change his plans for anything*.

"There was something else I wanted to ask you." Harry reached beneath the collar of his robes and brought out the time turner.

Grindelwald stared, leaning slowly forward. "So they have done it, then."

Harry could not help but be surprised. "You know what it is?" *Snape made it sound like a new invention.*

"I am educated enough to guess. Inquiries into the traversing of time are not a modern concept. None had succeeded by the time I was imprisoned. I presume that has changed."

"Yeah, this is called a time turner. It lets me travel a couple hours back in time."

Grindelwald's eyes had not left the time turner. "How did you acquire this?"

Harry nearly sneered --- the whole thing was still ridiculous. "The Ministry of Magic gave two to Hogwarts students to test them for education. We're not supposed to use them for anything other than extra classes and homework, but I don't think they have a way of monitoring us, really."

"And I presume that you will walk the logical path and take the fullest advantages afforded to you by your government's incompetence?"

"Once I figure out how." Harry ran a hand through his hair. "It's draining. It's like you're in two places at once any time you travel back in time. Your mind's working twice as hard and it catches up to you quickly."

Grindelwald drummed his fingers against his knee. "And you wish to ask if I have ideas on how this drain might be circumvented?"

"I've already been given a couple of ideas, but I need to learn Occlumency subskills that I know almost nothing about."

Grindelwald smiled. "Ah, yes. We shall begin immediately."

***September 24, 1993***

***The Great Hall***

***8:46 AM***

Harry noticed the tension hanging thickly in the air when he entered the Great Hall that morning. Whispers wafted from all four tables and hundreds of heads bent low. His own friends were tense when he approached. *Pansy isn't even looking at me. She usually can't stop staring*.

"Something's happened, hasn't it?"

"Black's been sighted here in the Highlands," Theodore admitted. The others shifted in their chairs --- Pansy even glared at Theodore like she wished he had never opened his mouth.

*They expect me to explode*. He reached for the paper, his expression blank.

***SIRIUS BLACK PLANNING AN ATTACK ON HOGWARTS?***

***By Rita Skeeter***

*Sirius Black is perhaps the most notorious prisoner Azkaban prison has ever housed. His dozen murders more than a decade ago were well-documented, as was his status as the lieutenant of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.*

*We all know who Sirius Black is and what he has done, but many of us allowed ourselves to forget about him until this summer, when his dark legacy was furthered by an impossible escape from Azkaban. In doing so, Black became the first prisoner ever to escape and started a nationwide manhunt that has thus far yielded no results.*

*Many witches and wizards all throughout the country have claimed sightings these past two months, but now, it seems that the Ministry of Magic have their first official lead.*

*Some in the community have suspected for some time that Sirius Black may target Hogwarts. It's only natural given his loyalty to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and the fact that his vanquisher dwells within the castle's walls. Some have gone as far as to say that Black's top priority is taking vengeance against Harry Potter for the events of October 31st, 1981, but others have been more skeptical.*

*Those skeptics are slowly losing ground after reports emerged claiming that Black has been sighted in a remote Scottish district and that a team of aurors was deployed to the area.*

*"We've thought for some time now that Black may be in Scotland," said the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge. "We've been prepared for this for some time. There's nothing to worry about."*

*When asked about the validity of this newest lead, Amelia Bones --- Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement --- admitted that this lead is one they are "taking special care to investigate thoroughly."*

The article continued with Skeeter speculating exactly how and when Black planned to strike. *Nothing but useless gossip*.

A fire burned inside him. His stomach ached from its heat. Its smoke coated his throat, choking him. *Calm down, this isn't the place*. He slowly brought his mind to heel. *Black will get his when I'm ready, I swear it.*

"Nothing surprising, really," Harry said, impressed by how calm he sounded. *I doubt my friends buy it, but I've probably disappointed a bunch of eavesdroppers.*

Theodore took back the paper. "The ministry was expecting this. They wouldn't have stuck a bunch of dementors here if they weren't."

"Here's hoping." Harry imagined a swarm of hooded figures descending on Black, imagined the laughter fading from his eyes, replaced by concern, then horror. *I can dream*.

Pansy cleared her throat. "If you boys are done dragging the mood down, I have gossip."

Draco's lip curled while both Crabbe and Goyle sighed. Theodore just rolled his eyes. Harry played along but secretly appreciated Pansy. *She's always been good at reading me and moving things along when they get tense*. He liked that about her; he had never considered how important it was until now.

"What is it this time?" Harry asked, exaggerating a sigh. "Has another couple gotten into the prefect's bathroom?"

"Nothing like that," she said with an evil-looking smile. She dropped her voice to a whisper. "It's about Daphne's sister."

Harry's interest leapt. He had meant to keep tabs on Astoria but had lacked the time. He had thought about the idea more. *She's afraid that I'll approach Astoria*. Between the boggart and the way she'd stared at him during her sister's sorting, it was the only logical answer. *She should have been less obvious*.

"Anything interesting?"

"She's having trouble in classes, but not in the normal way."

Theodore scowled. "Not in the normal way? What is this, a riddle? What are you on about?"

Pansy smirked. "Last week, the first years were learning the Lumos Charm and something went wrong."

"Wrong?" Draco asked. "What could possibly go wrong with a Lumos Charm?"

"She got the spell working, but it was apparently like lightning. The flash was so bright that a few firsties were sent to the hospital wing for headache cures and the person sitting across from her had to have their eyes looked over."

That was odd. *I guess her having trouble isn't that weird*. Daphne's brilliance had never extended to actually casting spells. *Nothing like that ever happened, though. I don't even know how that's possible*. Harry looked down the table and thought he saw her, but it was hard to tell; she was small and surrounded by larger students.

"That's not all," said Pansy. "Flitwick worked with her all of their next lesson and they couldn't get anything different to happen. It just flashed super bright every time."

*That makes even less sense*. A one-off outburst was one thing, but this was something different. *I'll have to ask Grindelwald about it*. He considered what Grindelwald might have done in his place. *He wouldn't sit back and wait for answers --- he would go after them*.

"Pansy," he whispered when Theodore and Draco began conversing about Quidditch, "since I probably won't see her until tonight, can you get a note to Cassie for me?"

***That night, in the Slytherin dorms...***

Harry sagged into his four poster bed. Fridays were always long and tiring. There was Double Potions, midnight Astronomy, and lessons with Dumbledore --- not to mention the use of his time turner.

Harry sighed and laid his head back against his pillows, only for something bright to catch his eye. There was a bluish glow coming from his trunk. *The journal*.

Harry climbed from bed and pulled a sleek, black journal from his bag.

He shivered. *It still reminds me of Riddle's diary*. Voldemort had sworn the only enchantments on it were ones to let them communicate discreetly. *I have to take his word for it; if he wanted to hurt me, he could have done it three times this summer.*

Harry flipped open the first page with trembling hands.

*It's been almost a month.*

He frowned, but scribbled his reply. *I'm not the best at communicating.*

*And you think I am?* Harry could practically feel the amusement in those words, but he ignored it and wrote his reply.

*You're the one who wanted communication.*

*Bold,* came the reply. *It has been a long time since I've spoken with someone so blunt.* Harry's heart froze. *Did I go too far?* he wondered. The words continued. *It isn't something I've ever encouraged in those who serve me, but it suits you and the relationship I hope we'll have.*

Harry breathed a sigh of relief. *I've never been good at holding my tongue. It got me in a fair bit of trouble before Hogwarts.*

This next reply came faster.

*We both know you would have been punished for existing in the presence of those creatures. You wouldn't have denied that even when we first spoke.*

*No, I wouldn't have. I've gotten a bit better at holding my tongue since Hogwarts, though.*

*The education system is quite proficient at quelling children's spirits. I have wondered at times whether that's the reason Binns remains employed.*

*Where the hell did that come from?* he thought, then wrote his reply. *What do you mean?*

*You will not find another magical institution with a ghost in a position of authority. I could overlook this if Binns was competent, but everyone who's passed through Hogwarts in the last century knows otherwise.*

Harry's frown deepened. *What does that have to do with muggles?*

*Everything. Classes in History of Magic are some of the only times the world cannot pretend that muggles have not wronged us. It is the one time during which their evils are exposed. The problem is that those expositions happen in Binns's class, where most students are more concerned with sleeping than they are with paying attention.*

Harry winced. He had stopped attending Binns's class last year and showed up only for compulsory tests and the like.

*It seems a bit much to believe,* he wrote back after considering. It was an interesting idea, but an insane one. *I know you hate Dumbledore, but I can't imagine him doing that.*

*Can't you?* Harry could practically see Voldemort's sneer. *Can you think of no time when Dumbledore has held secrets from you? Can you think of no time when Dumbledore has ever bent or altered the truth? Can you think of nothing that Dumbledore has ever hidden?*

Angry fires burned, fanned by the Dark Lord's words. *Neville's own family doesn't know how he died,* he thought. *I'll bet Luna's doesn't either, plus there's the prophecy. I only know what he says it means*.

Then there were the memories; the friendship with Grindelwald and the death of his sister. *Maybe more. Who knows what I might learn from Grindelwald*.

*No,* he wrote back, *but that doesn't mean I believe you. Dumbledore keeps Peeves around even though he's a menace. Maybe it's not that easy getting rid of ghosts.*

*It isn't, but it is within Dumbledore's capabilities. For all of his shortcomings, he is still the second greatest sorcerer alive.*

*Will I ever be that confident*? There was no doubt when Voldemort or Grindelwald spoke. It was like they knew the outcome of everything they talked about. *I wish I was powerful enough to be that confident*.

*I doubt this conversation will go anywhere,* Voldemort wrote, *so let's try something else. Have you further investigated the events of last June?*

Confusion fell over him and he frowned. *What do you mean?*

This reply came slowly. *I expected better from you.*

That stung. *Why? Why do I care what Voldemort thinks*? Harry scowled and scribbled his next reply. *What do you mean?*

*Two students have their minds altered by a powerful artifact and you're not curious about the after-effects?*

Harry's eyes narrowed. *I never really had much to do with the Carrows, so I honestly didn't think about them.* How had he not considered them?

*An oversight. I would have at least expected you to show some interest in a place so dear to your house's founder.*

Harry read the words again but still missed their meaning. *What is he talking about*? Then it dawned on him and he sat bolt upright, all weariness gone. *The Chamber of Secrets --- I haven't even explored the Chamber of Secrets*!

**Author's Endnote:**

**There really haven't been many good cliffhangers yet this year. This one will have to do for now. Shame :(**

**I will also just say right here that, if you're hoping Harry will find some vast library or instant power boosts down in the Chamber of Secrets, you will be sorely disappointed.**

**Book 3: The Looming of Shadows**

**Chapter 12: Shaken Psyches**

***October 2, 1993***

***An Abandoned Classroom***

***10:13 PM***

Harry's knee slammed against the stones, sending a lance of pain down his leg. It throbbed so fiercely that any previous pain was forgotten.

His pain vanished. Harry still felt muscles wriggling beneath his skin, but they were beginning to calm. He took a deep breath.

"Don't rush to your feet," came a voice from some distance away.

Harry gave himself a moment, then stood. The pain was gone but his right leg was stiff. It felt like the muscles of his calf had curled into a tight, unyielding ball.

Cassie tossed him his wand. "I never even saw the spell," he admitted. "What was it? The Sfíximo Curse?"

Cassie raised an eyebrow. "I didn't think you'd know the spell."

Harry shrugged. "I read about it in the Black library." The truth was that Harry had watched Grindelwald use the spell in a skirmish at Durmstrang.

Cassie flipped a lock of hair behind her ear. "It's impressive how many spells you know for your age."

"Was I right?" Harry asked. "Was it the spell you used?"

"It was. I almost missed --- the spell clipped your leg as you sidestepped."

*Shame I didn't step a bit further.* "Can you show me the wand movement? I've never actually cast it, but I'd rather avoid that one."

Cassie traced her wand slowly through the air. "There's a countercurse, but I don't envy anyone casting it on themselves. The curse isn't easy to ignore or shrug off."

"Maybe if you got hit with it enough times, your pain tolerance would just adapt."

Her lips curved down. "I doubt it. There are ways of raising your pain tolerance quickly, but they're frowned upon and considered unsafe."

Harry gave her a piercing look. "You just conjured spikes under my feet and threw a minor torture curse at me and now you're lecturing me about being safe?"

Cassie grinned. "I wasn't lecturing you. I never once said you couldn't do it or that I would hide it from you."

"Then how do you do it?"

"There's more than one way."

Harry put on an exaggerated scowl. *Is she trying to be difficult just for the sake of it?* "What are they, then?"

Cassie chewed her words. *Weird. She's usually pretty open*. "They're... not natural things."

Curiosity coiled tight about him. *What is that supposed to mean?* Harry held her gaze. "What are they?"

"Rituals."

"I've heard of them." A handful of books had referenced them, but never more than that. *Not that the idea is hard to work out*.

"Black family library again?" Harry nodded and she sighed. "No one in their right mind should ever have given you access to that place." She was probably right given what he had seen. *And I've avoided all the worst books. I wonder what's hidden in them*...

"So some of these rituals... what, boost your pain tolerance?"

Cassie twirled a strand of blonde hair. "There are different types. Most people just think they're parts of horror stories, but my father's said that they really can work. He just doesn't think they're worth it."

"What do you mean by worth it?" Harry asked.

Now she was tugging on that strand of hair. *She looks stressed*. "It's complicated. You don't just do a ritual and get better at something. There's always risk and sacrifice, at least that's how it is in the stories. You should ask someone who knows more than me. Just... be careful."

*That won't be a problem*. Between Voldemort and Grindelwald, there was a treasure trove waiting for him. *I bet the Black library has some books that actually explain them, too*. Harry had hoped books like that lurked in the Chamber of Secrets, but he had found nothing so far. *There has to be something down there. It can't just be empty rooms*.

Harry had planned to ask about Occlumency and whether that could be used to numb pain, but he decided against it.

*I should change the topic; she looks really stressed.* "Have you found anything out about Astoria?"

Harry had asked Pansy to pass along a note about Astoria and ask whether or not Cassie would investigate the rumours. She was uniquely positioned as a sixth-year prefect; they worked closely with the first years and made sure their classes went smoothly.

Cassie stopped tugging at her hair. "I talked to her yesterday."

*Good.* "And?"

"She was petrified just talking about it. It was weird."

"That's not that weird, is it? Aren't most first years embarrassed if they don't do well?"

"I don't think she was embarrassed. She looked really stressed."

Harry drummed his fingers on his knee. "Did she say anything?"

"Just that the rumours are true; her spells don't work right. I know Pansy told you about the Lumos incident, but it's not the only one. Her Colour Changing Charm turned the whole desk blue and it took Flitwick ages to turn it back. I've never heard of anything like it."

His curiosity mounted. "That makes no sense." Harry twirled his wand between his fingers. *Now I'm actually curious. This was just supposed to be getting back at Daphne*. It still was, he told himself, but there was another motive now. *I don't like not knowing things...*

***Soon after...***

Harry's footsteps echoed, mingling with his tangled thoughts. *Should I feel guilty?* *Aren't I just planning to do the same thing the Malfoys did to me*? It made him uneasy but he forced those thoughts down. *Better uneasy than blown up by a statue*.

What surprised him was how easily Cassie followed his lead. Suspicion prodded him sharply. *It would make sense if she's working for Voldemort*. It mattered not for now. Voldemort was on his side for the time being --- he would worry about that if it changed.

That thought bothered him less now. No matter the morality of his plans, he felt better having them. Being in control of things after such a chaotic summer was a relief. *One day I'll feel like this all the time; one day I'll control everything, I just need to be stronger*.

A shadow crawled up a nearby wall --- first a head, then the rest. *I really need to work on noticing when people get close*.

"Oh, it's you," said Draco, sliding his wand back up his sleeve.

Harry did the same, falling into step beside him. "I didn't expect to find you wandering the halls."

Draco's cheeks filled with pink. "I'll have you know that I wasn't wandering at all."

"Walking, wandering --- same thing, really."

Draco sneered at him. "Are you going to ask where I was, or are we going to spend the next ten minutes talking around the point?"

Harry raised an eyebrow. Draco's patience for quips and banter was shorter than he remembered. *He's been like this since the train ride*. "What were you doing?"

The two boys walked in silence, unbroken until the common room loomed ahead. "I was practicing."

*Draco practicing?* "Practicing what?"

"Isn't that part obvious? Aren't you supposed to be the smart one?"

"I'm not sure smart has anything to do with understanding you. Sanctity." The stone wall slid aside, admitting them into the common room.

A wall of noise greeted their entrance. Older students clustered around bottles of fire whiskey whilst lower years quibbled over cards or chess. Some students worked in the common room's corner, shrouded in shadow and slaving over piles of parchment. *They almost make me not like Saturdays*. Two armchairs sat unoccupied near the fire, surrounded by naught but empty space.

Harry glanced towards the armchairs. Draco sighed, but nodded. *We've hardly spent any time alone since making up*.

"You were practicing magic in secret, weren't you?"' Draco nodded, staring into the fire. "Was it the boggart? Did it represent something about the Chamber of Secrets?"

"The Chamber of Secrets?" Draco asked. "What does that have to do with anything?"

Harry studied him but saw no signs of deception. *Why is Tom Riddle his boggart, then? Why is everything so confusing lately?*

"Just a guess," he muttered. "I thought it might have represented the way you felt after Diana was captured or something. It would explain why you started practicing." Draco just shook his head. "So what were you practicing for? Your grades are good, aren't they?"

"My grades are fine, it isn't about that."

Harry considered the things that motivated him. Neville's death, the Malfoys' manipulations, Voldemort's wand hovering just inches from his metaphorical throat...

"That feeling isn't your boggart, but it's why you're practicing, isn't it?" Draco gave no answer, but that was all the confirmation Harry needed. "What are you working on?"

Draco stared straight into the flames. "Curses."

"Have you actually practiced with another person?" Draco shook his head. "You should ask Theodore if he wants in." He would have offered himself, but he was busy enough and would just have thrashed Draco. *That wouldn't be helpful; Theodore's a better match*.

Draco twisted the fabric of his sleeve. "I'll think about it."

*I expected him to just reject it*. "You really have grown up. When you said it on the train, I was wondering if you were serious. You were, weren't you?" Draco nodded. "What changed?"

"Everything."

*That could mean anything*. His tone was enough to make up Harry's mind. "If you ever need help with anything, let me know."

Draco finally looked up from the fire. "I didn't think we were friends."

Harry made himself smile. *Draco's earned this last chance; I can give him that*. "We weren't. We started over. I wanted proof that things would be different." He offered Draco his hand. "I think this is enough proof for now."

Draco hesitated for only a heartbeat before seizing his hand, wearing the first genuine smile Harry had seen on his face in months.

***The Gryffindor Common Room***

***8:56 PM***

Ron stepped into the common room, flanked by Fred and George. Panes of glass rattled, shaken by the fierce winds outside. Ron shivered in memory.

Their practice had started smoothly. It was a bright, clear night flecked by a thousand shining stars. The air was warm and the visibility was excellent; they could not have asked for better conditions.

Then the wind had died and an awful cold seeped through Ron's blood, halting his breath and chilling his bones. A hundred shadows glided over the high-winged gates, floating towards the pitch. Ron's grip had slackened as he buried a ruby-encrusted sword into Luna Lovegood's chest over and over again, feeling it halt then sink deeper each and every time.

George had noticed his plight and signalled to Wood, who ended the practice. Ron had been dragged into the changing room, where he remained until the dementors retreated back off the grounds.

"I don't get it," he snarled once he and Hermione had been left alone, sitting near the fire. "How do you lot just deal with them when I almost fall off my bloody broom? It's pathetic!"

"What's pathetic is the fact they're here at all," Hermione said. "Honestly, I know Professor Dumbledore argued, but surely there must have been something he could do."

Ron scowled. "Dumbledore's lost some power. Not that he can overrule someone like the minister anyway."

"But why would the minister want dementors near students? It's so incredibly backwards!"

"I dunno, but I'd like to take one of those beaters' bats and hit whoever suggested it over the head."

"I just don't understand how these people have any power in the first place. I thought we had it bad with some of the idiots in the muggle world, but then I came here."

Ron tried to shrug, but the effect was ruined by a shiver. He wrapped the scarlet blanket more tightly around himself, trying not to think of bloody fingers stretching across the chamber's floor each time he looked at it. "It's just how it is."

"But why?" asked Hermione. "Surely *someone* could do *something*?"

"I kind of just want to figure out what to do about those bloody dementors. I'm sick of feeling useless any time they're around."

Hermione looked out the window, scowling. "Yes, let's focus on that." She stood, looking expectantly down at him.

"Where are we going?" he asked, clutching at his blanket.

Hermione rolled her eyes. "The library, Ron, where else would we go to learn new spells?"
