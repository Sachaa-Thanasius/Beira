# Prologue

# *A Quest for Europa*

## A Crown of Thorns

Bright sun streamed down onto soft red petals and smooth green leaves; it soaked into his skin and dappled across the thin, red lines criss- crossing his fingers and hands. A bead of crimson trickled from the ball of his thumb, the pain throbbed through him as he stared at the trail of red. A vast distance stretched open between him and the small red droplet on his skin, like some great force had dragged the world off into the distance.

*Blood.* He tugged the small, brown thorn from his skin and dropped it into the dirt. The faint pain faded and he dropped a small, scrunched withered brown flower into the battered old bucket. *What's so pretty about roses?* He studied the red flowers as the hover flies and bees flitted around him. *They're just flowers.*

A dull, low rattle echoed from beyond the neat privet hedges

caging Aunt Petunia's rose garden. Whistling drifted after it.

*Post.* He snipped another dead rose from among the thorns, leaving a faint streak of red upon the bright green stem. *It must be Saturday again.*

The rattle rolled along the other side of the hedge to where the grey concrete drive met the grey pavement slabs. A bald, sweat-beaded head bobbed above the line of green leaves. He dropped the secateurs into the bucket atop the dead rose heads and wandered back toward the drive.

'Oh, hey there, kid. Bit of an odd one, this, reckon someone's trying to have you on.'

A thick letter was thrust into his hand and the trolley rattled along the pavement up the road.

His eyes dropped to the address. *My name...* A faint stir of emotion swirled through him and his hands shook; the green-inked letter trembled in his grasp. *Someone wrote to me?*

'Boy!' Uncle Vernon stomped out of the garage. 'Bring that here!'

*Too good to be true.* The brief flutter of feeling faded back into the void. *Of course.*

## Nobody, Slayer of Monsters

The hovering candle flames danced beneath a calm, deep blue ceiling. Professor Quirrell slumped into a pool of dark robes and purple turban upon the floor with a quiet sigh.

*A troll?* He watched the other students stream from the hall in cacophonous huddles, drifting after them at a distance that didn't leave him deafened. *Trolls are a thing? How did it even get in?*

'Mate, Hermione's down in that bathroom,' Ron whispered, tugging him through the flood of students. 'Someone needs to help her.'

The students bustled past, jostling, crowding, and shouting. Their heat smothered him like a thick, rough blanket, swirling round and prickling over his skin until his head felt light and his vision swam. He closed his eyes and held his breath. *One. Two. Three.* He opened his eyes and tugged his arm out of Ron's grip.

The prefects and teachers vanished into the distance. The drum of feet faded away. The second floor corridor loomed open before them.

An expectant gleam hovered in Ron's eyes and he pulled his battered wand out of his robes. 'C'mon, mate.' He darted down the corridor.

*Can't leave him to go alone.* He watched Ron disappear down the corridor. A faint, foul stench reached his nose; a thick, rotten reek. *Friends aren't meant to abandon each other.*

He hurried after him, gripping his wand tight in his hand. 'Why does

it smell so bad? Girls' bathrooms can't be *that* much worse than boys' ones.'

White tiles, sinks, and gleaming mirrors sat across from neat cubicles. Hermione stood red-eyed by the sink, hands on her hips, with a red-faced Ron gesturing with both hands.

*They seem fine.* He eyed the girls' bathroom sign, then edged into the centre of the bathroom to gesture toward Gryffindor Tower. *The troll's meant to be down in the dungeons anyway.*

A shrill scream tore from Hermione's throat and Ron shrank back

toward the corner with Hermione. He flinched and twisted round.

A hulking mass of grey and green loomed in the doorway. A branch the size of a small tree scraped along the bathroom tiles as the troll blundered in, sniffing the air and slobbering like Aunt Marge's bulldog.

*That's not ideal.* He backed away and eyed the thin sliver of door behind it. The troll rumbled and twisted round, demolishing a pair of sinks with its elbow. Porcelain shards skittered across the tiles. *I can't leave them, anyway. That's not what you're meant to do.*

Ron let out a raw yell and hurled a piece of metal pipe; it bounced off the troll's chest and skidded out into the corridor. Hermione screwed her eyes shut and shrunk into the corner.

The troll shook its head, then roared and swung its club. The piece of tree whistled over his head and smashed into the mirrors and sinks. Bits of glass rained down onto the floor.

*How do we fight a troll? It'll squash us like Dudley would a bug.*

Pain flashed across the back of his hand. A thin, red line marked it and crimson welled up in the breach. The bathroom, Ron, Hermione, the troll, and everything around him shrank away into the distance. *Blood...*

The troll rumbled and tugged its club free of the wall, scattering bits of plaster across the floor.

*No. I don't want to be squashed.* He jumped onto its arm and swung a fist at its face. His wand speared its nose and the troll roared, smashing its club through cubicles and the few remaining sinks. He clung on to the creature's lump-marked, scarred hide. *But I never get what I want.*

'Wingardium leviosa,' Ron yelled.

A loud thud echoed through the bathroom, then he found himself rolling across the floor as the troll crashed onto its face.

'Blimey,' Ron muttered. 'That whole swish and flick thing really

works.'

*We didn't get squashed.* He wiped thick, green slime off his holly

and phoenix wand onto a damp stack of spilt paper towels. *We really won.*

A sharp gasp echoed through the bathroom. Professor McGonagall surveyed the scene from the door with thin, pursed lips, then her gaze fell upon him and her eyes softened. 'Well done, Harry. Very well done.'

Something lurched beneath his ribs, gentle warmth flooded through him, and heat rushed to his eyes. *Tears.* He twisted away and smeared them onto his sleeve. *Why am I crying? It feels good.*

## A Philosopher's Folly

The white king's sword crashed onto the board at Harry's feet.

Chunks of black and white stone strewed the stark board; Hermione

crouched over Ron's still figure at the board's edge.

*We can't stop now. We need to save the stone.* Harry glanced at Hermione. *We can't let someone just take it.*

'He'll be fine.' She glanced up. 'He's not hurt, just out cold. We don't have time to take him with us.'

Harry wrenched open the small, plain wooden door with a pounding heart and found a large troll sprawled before him. A great lump rose from the top of its head and a thick, foul reek rolled over him. He gagged and blinked tears back from his eyes.

'It's asleep.' Hermione darted past it and dragged open the next door.

'C'mon, Harry. We have to save the stone!'

He stepped over the troll and through the door. Black and purple flames sprang up behind him and before him.

*We're trapped.*

'Brilliant!' Hermione stood before an array of bottles, clutching a piece of paper. 'This isn't magic -- it's logic -- a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in her for ever.'

*That seems like a bit of a generalisation.* Harry studied the flames. Their heat bathed his face like the scorching summer sun did Aunt Petunia's wilting garden. *Anyone who can figure out what's hidden here from a couple of clues can probably solve another puzzle.*

Hermione muttered to herself, skimming back and forth up the piece of parchment. 'It's tricky*.*'

Harry glanced over her shoulder, then back forth between the hints and bottles. *The red and black ones can't be poison and must be the same, so they're full of whatever nettle wine is. Which means the white and green ones are poison. That just leaves the last three.*

Hermione clapped her hands together and plucked the purple and

blue bottles into her hand. 'This one will take you forward, Harry.'

*Just me?* He weighed the small blue bottle on his palm as the world slid away into the distance. *All by myself?*

'There's only enough for one,' Hermione murmured. 'Sorry, Harry. I can't come with you, and, well, you're *you*. I know you'll manage to save the stone. You'll do better than me.' She unstopped the purple bottle and raised it to her lips. 'I'll find a teacher, that's what I do best.'

*I don't want to through there alone.* Harry caught the bright, warm gleam of faith in her eyes and the words died on his tongue. *But I have to.*

Hermione closed her eyes and darted through the purple and black flames into the troll room.

Harry tugged the top off the blue bottle and swallowed the small mouthful of potion. 'Hopefully, Snape's already been stopped by the defences.' He stepped through the indigo and ebony fire.

A black-robed, purple-turbaned figure stood before the Mirror of

Erised. 'Harry Potter,' it hissed.

*Of course.* Harry's heart sank. *Nothing ever goes right for me when*

*I'm by myself.*

## The Heir of Slytherin

A large, black serpent reared off the duelling platform as the flash of Lockhart's spell dissipated; it's tongue flickered out to taste the air. Small, dark eyes fixed themselves on the silent crowd as it tensed.

*It's going to strike.*

'Stop!' The word burst from Harry's lips.

The snake twisted around and fixed its gaze on Harry; its eyes were little chips of obsidian. A loud bang tore through the hall and the snake vanished. Harry flinched. A cold rush swept through his blood.

'Parseltongue,' Ernie Macmillan hissed, yanking Justin Flinch- Fletchley back from the duelling platform.

Whispers rose up all around Harry, they swirled round him, thick and dark as the vapour that'd burst from Quirrell's body, cold as the water of the Black Lake. A great gap yawned open between him and them. The murmurs closed round him like Dudley's clammy fists about a plastic figurine. Sweat trickled down Harry's spine and his heart thudded against his ribs.

*I hate this.* He threw a glance at Ron and Hermione's dishevelled figures, but they were caught on the far side. *I stopped him from being bitten. What's to whisper about?*

He jumped from the stage and the crowd melted away from him.

*Now they want to keep a nice distance.* The gap felt cold, cold as his fingers after clearing out the drains and guttering after a winter rainstorm and sharp and tense as Aunt Petunia's stare. *Only it's not so nice.* Flashes of primary school flickered through his thoughts. Dudley's smug smile as the rest of the class took their seats away from him. The neighbours eyes drifting over him as if Dudley's shadow was so dark it'd swallowed Harry completely.

He wandered through the corridor, past distant paintings and empty rooms until he found himself staring out over the Black Lake and the Forbidden Forest.

'They're all just like Dudley, and the Dursley's, and everyone I left

behind.'

Footsteps pattered up the stairs. 'Harry!' Hermione's voice rang up

the steps. 'Are you alright?'

*Almost all.* The world closed back around him. The abyss between him and everything else drew shut like a softly closed door. *My friends are better than that.*

He swivelled round. 'I'm fine. I just didn't like them all staring at me

like that. All I did was stop it from trying to bite him.'

Ron dragged himself up the stairs. 'Sounded real creepy, mate. Like you were egging it on, or something.'

Harry grimaced. 'Well I wasn't. I was trying to *save* him.' Hermione shot Ron a glare. 'And you did, Harry. Well done. Just,

everyone else doesn't understand that, so---'

'So they'll whisper about me.' A small cold ball tightened in the pit of Harry's stomach.

*Just like Dudley's friends, then everyone else in our class. And I'll sit alone in the corner at the back, like I'm not even there.* Hollow teeth gnawed through his gut and into the bottom of his heart. *And I'll go back to that awful empty place.*

'It really wasn't the best time to reveal you could speak to snakes, Harry.' Hermione chewed her lip. 'Salazar Slytherin could speak to snakes...'

'They think I'm the Heir of Slytherin.' He dragged a faint smile. 'What nonsense. My mother was *muggleborn*.'

Ron shrugged. 'They'll come around, mate. Let's get some lunch, forget about the whole thing for a bit, yeah.'

*Just... forget about it?* He blinked. *I guess I could do that. It won't*

*help to keep dwelling on it.*

Ron started down the steps. Hermione lingered for a moment, worrying her lip, then motioned toward the hall with her head.

*I guess they'll see.* He drifted after them. *And then they'll all come back.*

## A Cadmean Victory

Ginny sprawled on the floor, a swathe of her bright red hair lay over the stark stone, and the slim dark form of the diary rested on the floor beside Harry's legs. The basilisk writhed and twitched; Godric Gryffindor's sword gleamed between its fangs.

'You're dying, Harry Potter,' Tom Riddle murmured. 'You're dying and I'm nearly free.'

A sharp pain blossomed in Harry's arm. Three inches of broken fang stuck from it. 'Oh.' A soft burn crept through his veins, like the feel of running cold fingers beneath the hot tap. 'It hurts.'

'Basilisk venom.' Tom Riddle's form was sharp and clear as the stones around them. 'There's not much that hurts more. It kills everything.'

The world stretched off into the distance as the flame spread through him. The dark pool, the stone bust, Ginny's body, the carven effigies, and even Tom Riddle dwindled away until they seemed no nearer than stars in the night sky.

*It's just pain.* He touched a fingertip to the bright, red trickling from the wound. *My blood...*

Tom Riddle watched him, spinning Harry's wand in his hand. A strange gleam hovered in his eyes. 'What a waste.'

Beneath the venom's burn, a numbness crept through Harry; it weighed his limbs and robbed his fingers of their deftness, a hundred times worse than when Aunt Petunia had made him fish the frozen algae from the pond with bare hands.

*I suppose it could be worse. At least I got away from Privet Drive for a bit.* He let a cold, hollow fist close round his heart and drag it down somewhere into the dark of the emptiness within. *Probably shouldn't have tried to fight the basilisk myself. I should've got someone better than*

*Lockhart. I shouldn't have failed to save Ginny. But there's no point in*

*wishing.*

Fawkes alighted beside him with a gentle trill. Thick, clear tears leaked from his eyes and dripped onto Harry's arm, soaking into the ragged, torn robes around the fang.

*I can't die yet.* Sharp focus thrust from the void within and the world snapped back round him. He fumbled for the diary. *I need to save Ginny first.*

'Phoenix tears,' Tom Riddle hissed. He slashed Harry's wand at Fawkes, but the phoenix fluttered aside and hopped to safety. 'I forgot.'

Harry tugged the fang from his arm; the wound closed, melting back

together as if it'd never been there, and the burn faded from his veins.

Tom Riddle froze. 'What're you doing?'

He stabbed the fang through the diary. 'Saving Ginny.'

A high, raw scream tore from Tom Riddle's throat; his figure wavered, then burst into thick, black mist that dissipated like smoke into the wind. Ink fountained from the diary and pooled upon the stones beneath the ruined pages. Harry's wand clattered to the floor.

A soft moan rose from Ginny and she stirred.

*It worked.* Harry grabbed the fang-impaled diary from the floor and staggered to his feet. *I saved her.* A flood of warm relief and bright, hot triumph rushed through him. *I did it.*

## A Glimpse of Phobos

Rain drops crawled along the window in thin clear streams.

Beyond them, the countryside blurred past. Harry pressed his fingers against the glass; the cold seeped into his skin and a soft melancholy settled over him like night clouds veiling the moon.

Frost crept across the window. The beads of water turned to chips of ice and fell away. The melancholy coiled deeper, turned sharp as Petunia's kitchen knives and bit through him the same way that cold steel had slipped through his skin.

The door to the compartment rattled. Something slipped in amongst them, a thin thing with hoarse, rasping breath, long skeletal fingers, shrouded by a tattered, black cloak.

A faint high scream echoed in Harry's ears.

The world fell away.

'Not Harry,' a woman's voice pleaded. 'Not Harry. Take me instead.'

An awful numb crept out from Harry's heart. The world drained

away into it like blood swirling away into Aunt Petunia's kitchen sink. 'Please,' the woman begged. 'Please not Harry.'

'Avada kedavra,' a smooth, high voice hissed. A bright green flash tore across Harry's vision.

He stood on Hogwarts' quidditch pitch beneath bright, cold moonlight. Parseltongue rose up around him, faint as the night wind, and slim, dark shapes slithered through the grass at his feet. Whispers rose from the distant faces in the stands; all the faces Harry had ever know stared down at him from there, even Ron and Hermione lurked among them. They muttered from a world away while little Ginny sprawled still as death across the ground.

Tom Riddle stepped forward out of the night. 'There're no heroes, Harry Potter. There's only power.' He uncurled his fingers to show the bright, red stone sat upon his palm. Voldemort's crimson eyes burnt beneath his brows. 'And those too weak to seek it.' He burst into thick, dark mist.

*And eventually, we'll fail.* Voldemort's low murmur echoed through his thoughts. *Eventually, we'll be found lacking, left wishing, like we so nearly were in the chamber. And what then? What happens when Harry Potter the hero crumbles?*

The whispers rose from the stands, louder and louder, until they rang in Harry's head like he'd been clipped about the ear by Uncle Vernon. The short stretch of grass between them and him yawned open like an abyss and a crushing solitude closed over him like dusk. Ron and Hermione faded into the crowd and Harry's heart sank down into a dark, cold place.

*He disappears.*

## Heart and Soul

A hundred ragged-caped slender shapes swirled over the clearing.

Tall dark pines hemmed Sirius and his future self against the edge of the lake. The dementors descended in a loose clusters, swooping closer and closer to the pair of figures on the far side of the lake.

*Finally, a man who just cares about Harry, no matter who Harry is. We wished for someone for so long. For anyone.* His thoughts came smooth and high as the dementors swarmed. *But wishes like that, they never came true before, why would they come true now.*

'Harry,' Hermione hissed. 'What're you doing?'

'Someone will come,' he said. 'Someone drove them away.'

*Someone let me keep a wish. If Sirius is my godfather, I don't have to go*

*back to Privet Drive.*

'Harry...' Hermione's fingers curled round his wrist and he tensed. The hairs rose on the back of his neck as the heat of her hand seeped into his skin. 'Harry, *nobody's coming*.'

'They will.' He watched the hood slip back off the face of the first

dementor and slipped free of Hermione's grip. 'They must.'

*Wishes aren't just granted.* The smooth, soft murmur rose up from the back of his skull. *They're made first.*

He raised his wand and dragged up every moment of happiness.

Professor Lupin's pride, the stories of his parents, their faces in the Mirror of Erised, the gleam of faith and warmth in Hermione and Ron's eyes, Dumbledore's smile and bright blue eyes, and Sirius' raw, rough grin. 'Expecto patronum.'

A silver stag burst from his wand; it cantered across the surface of the lake, glowing bright as the moon. The dementors scattered from it like bats

from the beam of Uncle Vernon's torch, flitting away into the shadows

beneath the pines. A hot rush of triumph flooded through him.

*I did it. I saved us. It was me.*

'Come on, Harry,' Hermione hissed. 'Come *on*.'

He staggered away through the trees. *Pettigrew still escaped.* Cold fingers curled round his heart; their chill nails bit deep. *Sirius' innocence won't be proved.* The pines of the Forbidden Forest loomed over him, their shadows deep and dark as the black of Voldmort's shade. *I failed.* The breath caught in his throat and slipped from his lungs. *I failed. I have to go back.* Despair strangled the faintest ray of twisted humour. *Of course. Of course I do. I wished for it. And that means it won't happen.*

Hermione crept through the trees ahead, the snap of twigs beneath her feet sounded loud as fireworks over the faint whisper of the pine needles in the night breeze. He drifted after her, wrestling with the tangle of emotion writhing beneath his ribs.

*Wishes aren't given. They're made.* Harry clutched his wand tight in his fist and took a long, deep breath of cold night air. *No more waiting for wishes to come true. I'll make them happen myself.*

# From the Ashes

\'Harry.\' Hermione's greeting cut through the silence like one of the special Japanese kitchen knives Uncle Vernon had gifted Aunt Petunia over the summer.

A faint smile tugged at Harry's lips. \'Hey, Hermione.\'

Hermione's bushy hair, worried lip, and disproportionate teeth

made a beeline for Harry at remarkable speed.

*She looks just the same.* He recalled his piggish cousin explaining to his lackey, Piers Polkiss, that girls suddenly turned into beautiful women in their teens and his smile stretched a little further. It had sounded rather like Dudley expected it to happen overnight like some odd, human caterpillar. *No doubt his understanding was based off an extremely limited experience of girls and one too many adult magazines. Dudley would be baffled, by his logic, she ought to have become a beautiful butterfly by now.* Harry pictured his cousin's gaping mouth, piggy eyes, and extra chins with a chuckle. *She wouldn't be Hermione without those little things, just like Ron wouldn't be himself without his freckles, and Harry wouldn't be Harry without his glasses.*

Hermione's hand floated back and forth in front of his face. \'How has your summer been? Have you started studying? What are your classes? Have you dropped divination yet?\' Her questions rushed at him at Firebolt speed, devolving into a swift, swirling slur.

Harry blinked. \'It was okay, actually.\' He struggled to remember the other questions, but couldn't recall picking them out of the sudden barrage of words.

*Perhaps I\'ve spent a little too long by myself this summer. Still,*

*better than being Aunt Petunia's garden-slave.*

\'And your classes? *Divination?\'* Hermione folded her arms, edging a step closed.

He took a couple of steps back. \'Runes, arithmancy, and *yes*, I dropped divination.\'

She opened her mouth. 'What---'

\'Trelawny was starting to run out of original predictions for my

death.\'

*Best to keep my summer studying to myself. I'm not prepared for*

*a Hermione tirade right now.*

\'Harry! Don't you know you can\'t take fourth year runes or arithmancy without knowing the third year course?\' Hermione shook her head and gnawed her lip. \'You *really* should've checked, now you\'ll have to study to catch up or join the *third years*. You should've studied in the summer.\'

\'I\'m sure I\'ll find a way,\' Harry replied.

*Focus and intent. That's the way.* He smiled. *It's a miracle I*

*managed any magic before. I barely had any idea what I was doing.*

Hermione gnawed at her lip. \'Well, I can help you a bit. I know all the stuff you'll need to know and I'm comfortably far enough ahead to spare some time.' She glanced around. 'Where are the Weasleys?\'

\'Attempting to pack, I think.\' Harry caught her eye and grinned.

She sighed. \'Ron...\'

\'Harrikins!\' One of the twins thundered down the stairs.

The entire Weasley family appeared around him, chattering away.

*Loud.* Harry eyed the elbows and hands brushing against him and hunched in on himself, drawing a deep breath in and closing his eyes. *Is it me, or did they get louder over the summer?*

\'Is everyone here?\' Mrs Weasley bustled around, pausing before a bleary-eyed, dishevelled Ron. \'Honestly, Ronald.\' She straightened his collar and sighed. \'Percy was ready before you and he\'s not even interested in Quidditch.\'

'Time to go.' Mr Weasley shuffled out of the huddle and yawned. 'Don't want to be late.'

The group surged forward in a whirl of motion and a blur of noise, swirling around Harry until they were seated again.

\'Bulgaria will win,\' Ron declared. \'Krum's brilliant.\'

\'We disagree, Ronnikins. Far be it from us to dispute the talent of the mighty Krum---'

'---but our money is on the Irish.\'

\'Technically, George, our money is on the Irish and Krum,\' the other twin said.

\'Very true, George, very true. Ireland to win, but Krum to catch the

snitch.\'

*Apparently they\'re both George today.*

\'I still think Bulgaria will win it,\' Ron said. \'Krum will get the snitch

long before the Irish can score that many points.\'

\'Stop fighting,\' Ginny hissed. \'The teams are coming out.\'

The Bulgarian cheerleaders strode out onto the field like they'd

stepped straight from one of the American high school drama shows

Dudley gawped at in his room when he thought his parents weren\'t watching.

A hush fell over the crowd.

The cheerleaders twirled into dance, spinning in the stunned silence and beneath the weight of thousands of stares, a blurred swirl of silver and pale skin.

Harry stared. *Those cheerleaders don't move like this*. *They don\'t have silver hair that makes you want to run your hands through it, lips that look soft and sweet as sugar, or eyes as bright as stars.*

He leant forward. 'If I stood up, would they see me?' he murmured. 'Would they notice?'

*They won't see me.* His thoughts came in a smooth, light voice, welling up in the back of his head like cold, dark water. *They never do. No matter how much you wish for it.*

The distance yawned open between his seat and the silver-haired girls dancing. A gentle fist tugged his heart down into a cold hollow place. Harry leant back from the edge and hunched into his seat.

The cheerleaders' dance stilled, the noise of the crowd swelled,

and two sets of players burst into the stadium.

The Quidditch World Cup final commenced in a blur of motion and Harry lifted his omnioculars out of his lap, the green and gold blurs sharpening into a trio of Irish chasers. Harry focused on the distant figure of Krum as the Bulgarian seeker drifted apart from everything below, free as a bird.

A small smile crept onto Harry's lips.

Krum swivelled and plummeted out of sight. The crowd roared and something caught Harry on the cheekbone. His glasses slipped from his nose and the omnioculars sailed into the rows below.

*Where did my glasses go?*

He peered under his chair and caught a glimpse of reflected light at the very back. Harry stretched an arm under, but the glint of light hovered just beyond his fingertips. He tugged his wand from his pocket and hooked them into reach. A swathe of scratches covered the lenses.

*Inevitably.* He closed his eyes, imagining smooth, unblemished glass and repaired them with a tap of his finger. *Guess it was a good thing I slept on them. Even if I had to spend three days trying to do it without a wand.* Harry slipped his wand into his sleeve and shot a glance at Hermione.

Her eyes were fixed on the game, her lips pressed into a thin, white line.

*Good. If she'd seen, I'd not see her until she'd figured it out.*

He tracked her glare to the referee, who\'d stopped to dance and flex his muscles in front of the Bulgarian cheerleaders.

*He\'s a terrible dancer.* Harry laughed. *He's going to be very*

*embarrassed when he snaps out of it.*

\'They\'re veela,\' Hermione whispered. \'There's half a shelf on them in the school library that's all stupid drawings, but I did come across a reference in a potions book about amortentia.\'

He raised an eyebrow. \'Isn\'t that a *love* potion, Hermione?\' Hermione turned scarlet and Ginny flushed as red as her hair.

\'Harry, be *serious.* The book said veela aren't fully human and can use their

magic to charm anyone who finds them attractive. They're trying to *cheat*

by influencing the referee!\'

Harry threw another, longer glance in the direction of the Bulgarian team\'s cheerleaders. A faint thrill shot through him, but he took a deep breath and forced it down. \'Interesting. I\'m still curious why you were reading about amortentia, though?\'

Hermione huffed and turned away to speak to Ginny.

He smiled. *For someone who likes to know everything about what*

*I'm up to, she doesn't like to share half as much.*

Harry leant back in his seat again and pictured a small circle of blank ink on a white page until the crowd noise and flashes of motion drifted into the background and his heartbeat slowed.

A massive roar rose from the crowd, shattering his focus. Ron

surged to his feet, his elbow missing Harry's glasses by half an inch.

*What?* Harry stumbled to his feet.

Viktor Krum hovered over the stadium, his strong jaw and brows set in a determined frown and one hand raised above his head. Harry fancied he could just make out the twitching wings of the snitch within his grasp.

*He looks quite pissed for someone who just caught the snitch.*

Harry glanced at the scoreboard. *Oh, they still lost.*

The veela cheerleaders danced on with triumphant smiles. Ludo Bagman shouted the result over the crowd and their celebrations froze. Feathers sprouted along their arms, their eyes widened and turned dark, lips and chins elongated into curved, sharp beaks.

*Not completely human at all.*

\'Time to head back to the tent, Arthur,\' Mrs Weasley said. Her husband nodded, one eye still on the veela.

Blue flames appeared in the hands of some of the cheerleaders and a heated scuffle broke out between the other match officials and the enthralled referee.

They staggered down steep steps.

'I'm sure there weren't this many steps on the way up,' Harry

muttered.

Hermione turned, the glint of knowledge in her eye. \'It\'s a very clever space manipulation spell. You put your feet on a step and the space is stretched upwards so you actually go up much farther than you think. It\'s like a tiny magical escalator for each step.\'

\'Means an awful lot of different sets of steps for different levels though,\' Ron groused.

\'It\'s *brilliant*, Ron.\' Hermione\'s tone sharpened. 'It's really clever. I was reading about these kind of space manipulations over the summer and they're *fascinating...*'

*Lecture time.* Harry concealed a sigh beneath his breath and let a flood of arithmancy and runes wash over him. *Still, some of it makes sense now, so at least my summer study has been useful for something.*

Hermione\'s barrage continued until they found themselves back at

the Weasleys' tent.

'So you *do* need to breathe,' Harry quipped into the brief silence. 'I

was beginning to wonder.'

Hermione's lips crooked. 'This tent is another fascinating use of

spatial expansion, Harry. Kind of like what you see in *Doctor Who*.'

'In what?' Ron squinted at Hermione and Harry in turn. 'Is this another weird muggle thing?'

\'Look at all this, Harrikins.\' The twins waved fistfuls of gold under Harry\'s nose as they passed. \'Bagman bet against our prediction, gave us good odds too.\'

\'It ought to be enough now, Fred,\' the twin wearing the jumper emblazoned with the letter *G* crowed.

\'Indeed it should, George.\' His twin shovelled handfuls of gold from their pockets into their trunks. \'Best get it out of sight before mum comes and sees we\'ve been gambling, though.\'

Fireworks exploded and screeched above the tents as the Irish celebrations began.

*It's too loud again.* Harry slipped past Ron and Hermione's squabble, sidestepped Percy\'s sermon on the shortcomings of the absent Bertha Jorkins and settled down on the cot.

Sleep came to tug at him, drawing him down from scattered thoughts and bursting fireworks into the dark.

Something shook at his arm and he jolted upright with a cold rush of adrenaline.

\'Harry,\' Mr Weasley snapped, grim-faced. \'We need to leave *now*.

Get Ron and Hermione and get out of the camp. Stay together.\'

He fumbled for his glasses and his wand, stumbling to the entrance. Ron and Hermione's pale faces peered out into the camp from a thin slit at the door.

\'Come on, Harry,\' Hermione whispered, tugging at his arm. 'We need to get out of here.'

His skin prickled beneath her fingers, a twist of unease settling in his stomach. He frowned and pulled his arm away.

Screams echoed from close by.

'Let's go,' Ron mumbled. 'Quick.'

They fled from the tent toward the woods, caught in a tight, torrent of panicked people. Smoke hung over burning tents in the camps\' centre; it drifted over them on a strong breeze, thick and sour enough to choke Harry\'s breath. He ducked down and scuttled through the crowd toward a glimpse of green trees.

Flashes of light threw eerie shadows against the veil of smoke and the dull echo of explosions rang over the roar of the flames.

'Harry!' Hermione's shouts pierced the smog. 'Where are you?!'

Something cracked into the side of his head and everything went dark in a flash of white sparks.

Warmth seeped into his cheek; it swelled from warmth to heat, growing hotter and hotter against his skin.

Harry flinched.

A warm stickiness cracked and split on the skin of his face and his glasses slipped down his nose.

Harry hauled himself to his feet and clapped his glasses back into place. A thick, strong tang of smoke coated his mouth, clinging like tar.

Flames engulfed the line of tents a few metres from his face and a roiling mass of pitch-black smoke hung beyond them like dense autumn fog.

He staggered toward the trees, peering through the whirling grey.

*I hope everyone's okay.*

Thick, soft, warm grey ashes carpeted the ground and swirled out of the sky like snow. *What on earth caused this? A dragon?* He peered around into the still grey. *As long as it's not Voldemort or dementors again. I'd rather it was a dragon than them, dragons are fine so long as you leave their eggs be, and I'm not Hagrid.*

Harry strode through soft silence. A distant world stretched away into the smoke, muffled as if he'd stuck his fingers in his ears and hot embers seared his feet through the soles of his shoes. The charred remnants of furniture --- or worse --- crunched beneath his heels, echoing across the ash like thunder claps.

Bright purple light seared his eyes and something hissed past his face. Harry twisted about and snatched his wand from his sleeve.

Two pale purple spells streaked toward him.

He threw himself to one side and rolled in the ash, catching a glimpse of a thin, almost skeletal wizard draped in black robes.

\'Lacero,\' the robed wizard croaked. Another purple curse flashed at him.

Harry dived behind a mound of ash and the curse sailed away into the smoke.

\'I must remain unseen and behave,\' the wizard muttered, his wand snapping up and unleashing another trio of curses.

They tore through the ash, grazing his left elbow in a flash of fire. \'Expelliarmus!\' Harry\'s spell ricocheted off a glowing white barrier

of magic into the ash and sputtered out.

\'Stay unseen.\' The wizard\'s wand hand trembled and he dug the fingers of his free hand into his temples so hard his knuckles turned white

and blood trickled down his face. \'*No*.\' The skeletal wizard\'s voice shifted hoarse and sharp. \'The Dark Lord will reward me beyond all others when I manage something *great*.\'

*Of course it was Voldemort somehow. There better not be more dementors, too.*

\'Expelliarmus.\' Harry thrust his wand out.

The spell dissipated on the same shield in a faint wash of red. His opponent cackled. \'Crucio,\' he crooned.

A red curse tore past Harry\'s ear.

\'I\'m free! *Free!*' His cackle warbled like a cracking radio. 'When I take you to the Dark Lord I will be his most trusted servant! Loftier than Lucius! Greater than Goyle! Better than Bellatrix!'

A second red curse hissed past. The third caught him on the arm. White-hot fire wracked Harry's body and he collapsed into the hot embers, curling up around the pain.

\'I am his most loyal follower.\' The mad wizard raised his wand again, its tip glowing crimson.

*No.* Harry\'s gaze caught on the tip of the wand like a fish on a hook. *I don't want to feel that again.*

The tattered capes of the dementors fluttered through his thoughts, Voldemort's red eyes gleamed amongst them, framed by chalk- white skin and bathed in the crimson glow of the Philosopher's Stone, the shadow of the basilisk loomed over him like a cloud across the face of the sun, and Pettigrew snivelled and scuttled away into the grass in the cold light of a full moon.

*No more hoping.* A shard of ice tightened somewhere near his heart, his magic snagged on it, caught like a sleeve on the thorns of Petunia's roses. *Wishes are made.*

Harry slashed his wand at the cackling Death Eater. The ash swirled against the wind.

A vast, ebony basilisk lunged from the smoke; it smashed into the Death Eater's chest, hammering him into the ground and vanishing in an explosion of hot smoke.

A deep, numb ache seized hold of Harry and he tottered and swayed, clutching his wand with sweat-slickened fingers.

The mad wizard lay still as stone beneath a settling veil of grey

ash.

Harry edged closer, holding his wand out in trembling fingers,

snatching shallow gasps.

Bright, gleaming points of bone poked from black tatters. A gaping spread of red gore and glistening blue guts pulsed with fading crimson spurts and a thick, foul reek filled Harry\'s nose.

He gagged, pressing his face into the crook of his elbow and squeezing his eyes shut. *He's dead. Gone.* Harry stared at the wand in his hand, watched its tip tremble with every throb of his hammering heart. *And I did that.*

Smoke swirled round him and the ash floated down, covering the wizard\'s corpse in a thin, pale sheet.

Harry stumbled a few paces back until the stench faded and slumped to the ground. *I did that.* Quirrell's burning face twisted and

melted in his mind's eye, and Harry's stomach bubbled and surged. *Just like then.*

The ash buried his legs, soft and warm as a blanket.

He wrapped his arms 'round his knees and buried his face in them,

letting the world drift into the distance. *I think I\'ll just stay here for a bit.*

# A Chance for Glory

A small, dark space closed over Harry, gentle, soft, warmth against his skin.

*Like my cupboard. Only more comfortable and with fewer spiders.*

The blackness drew back.

Hermione stood over a vast black cauldron. Her hair shifted from bushy brown to bright, sleek silver and back again in time with the beat of Harry's heart.

*That\'s a bit odd. She hasn't been messing with polyjuice again has she?* He reached up to rub his glasses clean, but found smooth skin beneath his fingers. *Why isn't everything all blurry?*

Harry squinted at the cauldron and pretended Hermione's hair wasn't doing anything untoward. \'What\'re you making?\'

She swivelled. Huge, dark eyes stared back from above a cruel, hooked beak.

Harry recoiled.

\'Amortentia,\' she whispered, dipping a ladle into the cauldron.

'Liquid love.' She strolled toward him, wand in one hand, ladle in the other.

Harry tried to take a step back, but found himself rooted in place.

Hermione's brows curved into a deep vee and her vast, black eyes narrowed. \'It\'s for you, Harry. Just what you need. Drink up.\' She proffered the ladle.

A bright, shining liquid shimmered under his nose. Scentless, sparkling steam rose from it, warm against his nose. Harry peered closer. Twisting, slithering, silver serpents writhed within it.

\'I don\'t want to drink that.\'

She raised the ladle to his lips. \'It\'s for your own good, Harry.\' \'No,\' he spluttered, turning his face away.

The silver snakes went squirming all down his front and the ladle clattered to the floor.

\'You should\'ve drunk it, Harry,\' Hermione hissed. 'You should've

drunk it!'

She lunged, feathers exploding over her body and her beak

gaping toward his throat. A flash of green light seared at Harry's eyes and

he flinched upright with a gasp.

The familiar white sheets and square beds of the hospital wing surrounded him.

Harry pictured a small dark circle of ink on a white page and let himself sink into it until his heart slowed and his breathing calmed.

\'Mr Potter.' Madam Pomfrey's stern tone rang out from the far end of the ward and her heels clicked toward him. \'You\'re awake. Good.\'

\'I hope so,\' Harry replied.

*Weird, veela-Hermione dream.* He shuddered. *That dream is going straight into the too disturbing to think about category*.

Madam Pomfrey gave him an odd look. \'You\'re in the school hospital wing. Term hasn\'t actually started, but it was so close it was

decided you\'d be better off here than at St Mungo\'s once we knew you were stable.\'

\'What happened? I remember falling asleep in the ashes of the camp at the World Cup, but that\'s it.\'

\'You were found by one of the Bulgarian team\'s cheerleaders after the chaos of the attack was over. She brought you to the nearest hospital point. The Weasley family and Miss Granger then brought you here once your condition was established as non-severe.\'

\'Are they all okay?\'

\'Miss Granger and the Weasley family were all quite worried, but otherwise fine. You however, Mr Potter, somehow exhausted yourself well past what ought to be possible for a child your age, and in recovery you have set a new record for your lengthiest stay in my hospital wing. I daresay it is the first time that a student has managed that before term has begun.\'

*They're all okay.*

Harry released a quiet sigh. \'That\'s good.\'

Madam Pomfrey fixed him with a stern look. \'It\'s not *good*, Mr Potter. Honestly, you seem to almost die at the end of every year; you\'d think you might have learnt some caution by now.\'

\'It\'s the start of the year.' He mustered a grin. 'I wasn\'t expecting

anything for *months*.\'

\'Be that as it may, Mr Potter, you are awake. Once I have made sure you are fine, you may return to Gryffindor Tower.\' The nurse placed the tip of her wand against his forehead, tutting when Harry flinched.

\'Everything seems fine.\' She nodded. \'Off with you and don\'t let me see you back in this bed for the rest of the year.\'

*At least I can finally use my wand to do magic again.* Harry charmed his hospital gown into the guise of a set of school robes and padded toward the Great Hall in borrowed slippers. *I hope they saved Hedwig and my stuff.*

\'You\'re alive.\' Ron greeted him midway across the Great Hall. \'Yes, Ron,\' Hermione said. \'That\'s a *great* way to say hello to your

friend who was in a coma because he used too much magic.\'

\'I don\'t mind.\' Harry laughed at the outraged expression on her face and walked with them toward the Gryffindor common room.

Ron prodded him on the arm. \'So what happened, mate?\'

*I killed someone.* He felt the bile rise and swallowed it and everything else that'd churned up with it back down somewhere safe. *Someone who probably deserved it. Like Quirrell.*

\'I\'m not actually sure,\' he said. \'It was just chaos. One moment I was running with you guys, then I got hit by something and a few minutes ago I was waking up in the hospital wing.\'

\'The healer at the World Cup said you'd forced so much magic out of yourself you should be dead, Harry.\' Hermione folded her arms. \'That means you tried to push so much magic into a spell that it took every scrap of energy you could muster and your basic body functions almost shut down as a result.\'

*The basilisk.*

\'I don\'t remember casting a spell like that.\' Harry shrugged. \'So what actually happened to cause all that havoc?\'

Ron gaped. \'They haven\'t told you yet?!'

Hermione sighed and let her arms slip back to her sides. \'Harry only just woke up, Ron. How could he know?\'

\'Oh.\' Ron rubbed at his freckled nose. \'Well, it was Death Eaters, mate. They attacked the site, only you can\'t tell anyone I said that, because we heard it listening to Percy and Dad talking before work. Apparently, they went after the muggles near the site and anyone nearby they didn't like. It\'s been chaos at the Ministry and Dad reckons something\'s up, because Percy\'s boss, Mr Crouch, has supposedly resigned---'

\'That\'s not what they said.\' Hermione frowned and gnawed at her lip. \'Mr Crouch is supposed to be resigning later in the year. Something's happening that he\'s organised before he can retire easily. He\'s tendered his resignation unofficially according to Percy.\'

\'Same thing, Hermione,\' Ron said.

Harry shook his head. \'It\'s not the same thing, it means whatever he\'s doing must be really important if he still has to carry on after that fiasco.\'

\'There are loads of rumours flying around the Ministry. Bill says he heard one of the auror captains talking about Barty Crouch\'s son being found dead in the campsite.\'

A cold chill traced down Harry's spine.

\'He was a Death Eater, Harry,\' Hermione said. \'Honestly, Ron, you never explain anything properly. Barty Crouch Junior was supposed to have died in Azkaban ages ago. He was a *horrible* wizard.\'

*At least I know he deserved it.* A little murmur rose up from somewhere in the back of Harry's mind, welling up like blood from the prick of rose thorns. *Like Quirrell.*

'What else happened?\' he asked.

\'Not much,\' Hermione replied. \'We were all so worried about you.

Mrs Weasley went around every healing point trying to find you.\'

\'Yeah. Mum was beside herself. Thought you were dead.\' Ron rolled his eyes. \'I told her you weren't going to just give up and die after all the stuff you've got through already. Some gorgeous Bulgarian girl carried you to the refugee tents in her arms about an hour or so later. It might have been worth being injured just to be in her arms.\'

Hermione elbowed Ron in the stomach. \'It\'s not funny, Ron. That was a *veela*, they\'re not just pretty faces you know. She could have done *anything* to him.'

\'They *are* gorgeous, though,\' Harry said, only to receive Hermione\'s elbow himself. He rubbed at where her sharp elbow had dug into his ribs. \'So, how long until term starts?\'

\'It starts today, Harry,\' she told him. \'Where is everyone, then?\'

\'It\'s only ten, mate.\' Ron waved a hand at the ceiling. \'Still another hour or so before anyone arrives. You need to speak to Dumbledore about what happened. He asked us to tell you when you were awake.\'

\'I need to change as well,\' Harry said.

Hermione shot him an odd look. \'You\'re in school robes, Harry.'

\'I charmed my hospital gown,\' he replied. \'I don\'t know how long it will last.\'

\'That\'s quite advanced spell-work, Harry.\' Hermione beamed at him. \'I only read about doing that last year.\'

\'Headmaster first, then. Get it out of the way.\' He detoured toward the gargoyle, a knot of dread coiling tighter in his stomach with every step.

\'Sugar quills,\' Hermione commanded the gargoyle.

\'Ah, Harry.\' Professor Dumbledore opened the door with a smile. \'Come and have a seat. Are you feeling better?\'

*A bit sick, really.* He smothered the images of Barty Crouch Junior's corpse. *I did nothing wrong. He wanted to take my life away. I made sure he couldn't. It's self defence. It's fine.*

\'Much better, sir.\'

\'I was beginning to fear you might not wake up in time for the school year and end up missing classes.' Professor Dumbledore steepled his fingers. 'It would be a shame to be so behind on your schoolwork so soon.'

*I\'m sure Snape would\'ve been gutted if I\'d missed potions.*

The portraits snoozed on the walls of the office. Fawkes peered at him with a dark eye, ruffling his feathers up.

\'Do you remember what happened?\' Professor Dumbledore asked. \'I don\'t want you to feel I\'m forcing you to think about anything unpleasant, some quite atrocious things were done to the muggle owners of the site, but anything you can tell me may help bring the perpetrators to justice, Harry.\'

\'Actually I don\'t remember much at all, sir,\' Harry said. \'We tried to run out of the camp into the woods, but something hit me and I blacked out. As you know, I was found afterward and brought here.\'

Professor Dumbledore ran a hand through his silver beard. \'At least you don\'t remember anything terrible, then. You\'re too young to have to live with such things.\'

\'Professor Dumbledore?\' Harry measured his words on the tip of his tongue. \'Is it true about Barty Crouch\'s son? The Death Eater? I heard he was found in the camp.\'

\'Unfortunately, it does seem to be the case, though I recommend you keep this information to yourselves. It could cause great panic if everyone suddenly starts to think Azkaban can\'t keep hold of its prisoners.\'

\'We will, professor,\' Hermione promised.

\'You had best go and prepare for the welcoming feast, Harry,\' Professor Dumbledore suggested with a twinkle in his eye. \'Those charmed robes, while impressive, may not last for the whole meal.\'

\'I was just going to, sir.\'

\'Very well, then. Try and stay out of trouble this year, Harry. There will be unfamiliar faces around us soon.\'

\'Of course there'll be unfamiliar faces,\' Ron blurted the moment the gargoyle closed. \'The first years will be here, they come every year.\'

\'I doubt he means the first years, Ron.\' Hermione laughed. \'It\'s probably something to do with whatever Mr Crouch was organising. He mentioned being at Hogwarts to Percy at the World Cup. He seemed quite cross that Bertha Jorkinshad up and vanished on him, I got the impression she was meant to be organising and sorting a fair amount of it out for him.\'

The fire at the heart of the Gryffindor common room crackled in front of empty chairs. The gold and red hangings swayed in the faint chimney draft, rattling against the stone walls. A thick sheaf of parchment fluttered on the notice board.

'Look, someone's given us our schedules!' Hermione accelerated

across the floor, dragging both Harry and Ron on either arm.

*Someone who deserves a good hexing.* Harry exchanged a grin with Ron. *She's about to get stuck into one of us over our choices. Probably Ron.*

Hermione glanced at Ron's and went pink in the face. 'Divination! Just because you think it's an easy OWL doesn't mean you should suck up that washed up old bat's drivel, Ronald!'

Harry slipped away to change, listening to Hermione's voice echo

up the stairs while she chewed Ron out.

'It's not the right attitude,' she scolded a cowering Ron as he returned. 'You're not here just to get some easy grades, Ron. You need to know this stuff for later life!'

*Well, best to remove mine before she gets stuck into that, too.*

Harry pulled his out of the bundle.

Hermione's gaze snapped to him and she tugged the schedule

from his hands.

He frowned. *Rude.*

\'Fourth year Ancient Runes and Arithmancy,\' Hermione read aloud. \'How did you get into the classes without doing the third year exams?\'

Harry grinned. '*Magic.*'

She huffed. 'Fine. Don't tell me. I'll find out from Professor McGonagall.'

\'Why did you take those?\' All the blood drained from Ron's face. \'Divination and Magical Creatures are easy OWLs. You\'ve gone and done a *Hermione*, mate.\'

\'If by that you mean he\'s made an intelligent decision about his future, then you are quite right, Ron.\' She opened her mouth, closed it, and opened it again, biting her lip and waving Harry\'s schedule at him. \'You might be *really* far behind in your electives, Harry. It\'s good you want to try, but I don\'t know if you\'ll be able to manage everything.\'

*Thanks for the faith.* A flicker of irritation passed through him. \'I\'m sure I\'ll be fine.\'

*More than fine.* Harry thought back to his list. *Ancient Runes has a couple of tricky long essays, but is mostly about arrays and intuition*.

*Arithmancy's just the magic of maths, it's the most logical of all the*

*subjects*. *All pretty easy to visualise and not too much writing.*

\'If you say so.\' Hermione gnawed at her lip. 'I'm just worried you'll really struggle. You're not at the bottom of the class or anything, Harry, but you've picked a tough couple of subjects for yourself.'

Harry swallowed down another short flare of annoyance. 'I'll be fine, Hermione. I know what I'm doing.'

'Well, when you need help, you can always come to me, Harry.'

*Oh I can, can I?* He clenched his jaw and took a quiet, deep breath.

Ron glanced between the two of them a couple of times. \'The welcoming feast starts soon. We should go down and join everyone.\'

\'Yeah.\' Harry plucked his timetable out of her hand and stuffed it into his pocket. \'Let\'s go.\'

Students teemed in the corridors, their shouts bouncing off the ceiling and walls. A cacophony of footsteps and conversation reverberated through the castle like a thunderstorm. Younger students brushed past him as he wove 'round groups of older ones.

*It's so loud.* Harry grimaced as a cluster of second years squirmed through the three of them. *And they always have to get so close.*

He joined Neville and Seamus about halfway along the table. Ron slipped in alongside him, gazing down at his sparkling plate with some consternation.

Harry patted him on the shoulder. \'Food soon, Ron.\' The Sorting Hat drooped on the chair at the front.

*No doubt it'll be singing soon. And that's always loud, too.*

\'Do you think it makes up a new song every year?\' Harry wondered as it broke into verse.

Ron yawned and shrugged. \'Dunno, mate, but my brothers say they\'ve never heard the same one twice.\'

\'That probably means it does. Your brothers must\'ve covered the last decade and it *does* have all year to write them.\'

\'When it\'s not delivering swords to you, you mean,\' Ron said. \'It\'s a good thing it does deliver swords,\' Harry replied with a

chuckle. \'What happens if there\'s another giant snake in Hogwarts and

Neville needs to kill it? He can\'t be expected to go get the sword himself now can he.\'

'Hush,' Hermione hissed. 'You're not supposed to be talking.'

The sorted first years squeezed onto the ends of the tables and Professor Dumbledore rose to speak.

Harry cocked his head. *If something really is happening, he'll probably mention it now. Let's hope it's not another death-trap corridor, dementor swarm, or giant snake.*

\'A few announcements before we all get too distracted by our impending food to forget them. Firstly, I would like to welcome Professor Moody to our teaching staff. He will be taking over the role of Defence Against the Dark Arts. Secondly, I must remind members of all years that the Forbidden Forest is so named for a reason. And lastly, this year, after centuries, a great sporting event will be making its return. This means, unfortunately, that there will be no quidditch.\'

A murmur rose from the hall at this announcement. It blossomed into full mutiny.

*They were less upset about that time a troll got in and nearly*

*killed us.*

\'The Triwizard Tournament will be held at Hogwarts come

October,\' the Headmaster said. \'A chance, for those who enter, to earn eternal glory as school champion.\'

\'So that\'s what\'s happening!\' Ron pounded the table with his fist.

\'I\'m definitely putting my name in. He let out a long sigh. 'Eternal glory...\'

\'Professor Moody looks none too impressed about it,\' Hermione

said.

The new teacher\'s gash of a mouth turned down, twisting the

scar-ravaged face above into a forbidding frown.

\'He looks like he\'s been through the wars,\' Harry said.

\'He has,\' Ron replied. \'That\'s Mad-Eye Moody, that is. Dad says he was one of the greatest aurors back in the war against You-Know-Who, but that he\'s sort of lost it recently. Can't deal with peace-time, or something like that.\'

\'His eye is a bit creepy,\' Neville piped up.

Ron nodded. \'It\'s supposed to be magic. Don\'t know what it actually does, though.\'

Harry helped himself to bread, avoiding Hermione's pointed attempts to place dishes close to his plate. He scraped some butter across it and took a small bite.

\'You need to eat more than just bread, Harry.\' Hermione tried to

spoon half a bowl of potatoes onto his plate. 'You've been in a coma!'

Harry deflected the serving of potatoes onto Ron's plate. \'Ron\'s

eaten enough for all three of us.\'

Ron speared and devoured the largest of the potatoes without pausing for breath.

She huffed. \'Just because Ron eats enough food for a small country doesn\'t mean you should starve yourself to compensate.'

*Is this what having a mother is like?* Harry wrinkled his brow. *How annoying.*

\'I\'m doing it out of protest,\' he said. \'The food is all made by house elves. That\'s practically *slavery*, Hermione. I can\'t exploit their efforts in good conscience.\'

Hermione dropped her fork as if it had bitten her.

\'You\'ve done it now, Harry,\' Ron muttered. \'We\'ll be hearing about this for the rest of the year.\'

\'Should\'ve taken the potatoes,\' Seamus said. \'Who knows where this will lead?\'

Hermione stared down into her plate of food as if it had all turned to ash in her mouth.

Seamus rolled his eyes. \'Did you hear about the World Cup?\' \'Yeah,\' Ron griped, \'Ireland won. Congratulations.\'

\'Not that.\' Seamus grinned. \'Well, a little bit that, but I meant the

attacks.\'

\'We were there.\' Hermione said.

\'Harry was in a coma until this morning.' Ron swallowed what

looked like half a chicken. \'He got carried out of the camp by one of those beautiful, Bulgarian cheerleaders.\'

All of the nearby guys turned to stare, even Neville.

\'You learn that your friend was in a coma and the first thing you do is imagine the cheerleaders.\' Hermione shook her head. \'I\'m going to the library.\'

She stalked off down between the tables.

\'Wasteful that is.\' Ron helped himself to Hermione\'s plate. 'Can't leave good food to go off.'

Seamus chuckled. \'Imagine what the house elves would think?\' Dean slid into Hermione's spot. \'What was the cheerleader like?\' Harry shrugged. \'Don\'t remember. I *was* in a coma.\'

\'I saw them during the game,\' Ron said. \'They were gorgeous.\'

\'Hermione said they were veela, apparently they're not fully human and can charm men with their magic.\' Harry shrugged. 'So they aren't *naturally* attractive. Well, they are, but they can also cheat.'

\'Anyone that looks like that is going to charm me. Until they grow all those feathers at least.\'

Seamus choked on a sausage. \'Feathers?!'

Ron nodded. \'When they got angry at the end of the match they grew feathers and beaks, then started throwing fireballs around. They didn\'t like that Bulgaria lost.'

\'Is that what started all the fires then?\' Neville asked.

\'Nah, that was Death Eaters, or people dressed like them,\' Ron said. \'Dad says there was no Dark Mark like they used back in the war, so it might not have been real Death Eaters --- just sympathisers.\'

\'Ministry didn\'t catch anyone, though,\' Neville piped up. \'Gran was furious that they all got away with it. She spent an hour muttering to herself about how useless Fudge is.\'

Seamus grimaced. \'It doesn\'t exactly inspire confidence. Still, the Irish won, and that\'s what counts.\'

Harry forced down a few more bites and pinched his nose to drink some pumpkin juice.

\'Let\'s head back to the common room,\' Dean suggested. \'I\'ve got to unpack everything still, but I\'m fairly sure I\'ve brought the new exploding snap cards to replace the ones Lavender lost. Anyone fancy a round or two?\'

A quiet murmur of mutual consent rang round the table and the group rose to return to Gryffindor Tower.

\'Harry.\' Three familiar voices caught him halfway along the hall.

\'Angelina, Alicia, Katie.\' He smiled at them each in turn. 'You look quite unhappy.'

'They cancelled *quidditch*,\' Katie fumed. \'This was going to be a *really* important year for us. We needed to start to add new faces to the squad, like a keeper, or the other teams will start to catch us up.\'

Harry chuckled. \'At least you\'ve got the Triwizard tournament.

Eternal glory obviously can't compete with quidditch, but in a pinch...\' Alicia and Angelina laughed. Katie continued to seethe. \'Aren't you going to enter?\' Angelina asked. \'I am.\'

\'No,\' Harry said. \'I\'m going for a nice quiet year. No snakes, no dogs, no dementors, and hopefully no more trips to Madam Pomfrey, either.\'

\'Fair enough,\' Alicia said. \'Hogwarts\' champion will be from the upper years anyway. We know more than you cute little fourth years.\'

Harry leant back from the attempted pat on the cheek. \'Where do the other two champions come from?\'

\'Durmstrang and Beauxbatons, they\'re the biggest and most famous magical schools in Europe. Some of their students will probably come here to support their champions when we compete.\'

\'Well good luck, Angelina.' He waved a hand toward the tower. 'I

promised the guys I\'d play exploding snap with them.\' \'Bye, Harry,\' they called after him.

*Something will go wrong, though.* Harry slipped through the stream of students heading from the hall. *Something always does.* Barty

Crouch Junior's face and the basilisk, part ash spell, part creature from the

chamber, flashed through his head. *I should make sure I'm ready.*

# A Fire Shall be Woken

\'Welcome back to potions.\' Snape\'s drawl penetrated the gloom of the dungeons better than the absent daylight, the smell of lead, or even the sharpest knife.

Harry repressed the urge to sigh. *No doubt Professor Positivity will be continuing his best efforts to make this class miserable for each and everyone of us, and especially me*.

Snape's dark eyes flashed and his lips twisted into a sneer. \'This is the year before OWLs and thus the year in which those who truly have the talent for potions begin to separate themselves from those too lazy to apply themselves to such a delicate art.\'

*Where does he even get his impression of me from?* Harry felt Snape's eyes come to rest on him. *Presumably he just has severe personal issues. All the time in the dark and the constant exposure to toxic ingredients can't be good for anyone\'s health, mental or otherwise.*

\'The instructions are on the board.\' Snape flourished his wand at

the blackboard and a long list of cramped white writing appeared. \'Begin.'

*At least I know a bit more about what I'm doing this year.* Harry sighed and reached for his new, expensive, silver-plated knife. *All the high- quality, inert metal equipment's so pricey it's no wonder it's only the Malfoys of the world who can afford to do well.*

Ron slaved over his cauldron on the closest bench with all the delicacy of a confunded troll. His *neatly diced toad liver* went into the frothing mess in misshapen chunks and twice as much sneezewort as necessary had followed it.

*It might be a good idea to finish before that explodes*.

He poked his leeches with the tip of his knife and tried to recall some of his summer reading. *Easily contaminated and quick to dissolve. The size and shape is really important.* Harry spared a glance at Malfoy who was attempting to cut his leeches in mid-air while poor Pansy Parkinson flinched away from his ornately-engraved knife. *I heard a rumour their parents want them to marry, but he doesn't seem too concerned about ruining her looks with that knife. I guess Madam Pomfrey can probably heal it.*

Harry sliced his leeches using his old knife as a chopping board, trying his best to avoid letting any of the slimy creatures touch the desk --- or anything else. He flicked the neat squares in and to his delight the potion shifted toward the described shimmering turquoise.

*That actually went okay.*

He snuck a peek at Hermione\'s as she prepared a vial. The exact shade of turquoise described by Snape shone in her small cauldron, but he fancied his potion had more of the right kind of shimmer to it.

*And I'm among the first to finish, so Snape can't come and linger*

*over me.* Harry hid a smile. *That ought to ruin his morning.*

Snape gave a dismissive sneer as he placed his vial in the rack, but Harry felt his eyes tracking him all the way back to his desk. He turned around and found Snape had moved to lurk over Neville.

Neville's potion turned from a passable deep blue to a shade of

yellow so sickly and bright it attracted the attention of most of the class.

\'Longbottom.\' Snape tutted. \'It was going passably well, but your utterly inescapable ineptitude has proven itself\... *again*.\' He swept back past Harry to his gloom-shrouded desk, passing an eye over his attempt to leave his cauldron clean.

Hermione finished, then Malfoy, and soon most of the class were making some half-hearted attempt to clean their cauldrons while Neville tried to rescue whatever concoction he'd produced this time.

Harry studied the bright, lime-green liquid from a safe distance as it started to make a strange, high-pitched keening noise like an attention- starved dog. *It looks the same colour as the basilisk's scales.* A faint urge to compare the snake to not just Neville's potion, but his spell from the World Cup seized him. *I wonder if it's all still there, or if it's rotted away a lot.*

\'If that is everyone, you may leave,\' Snape drawled from a dark corner at the back of the classroom.

*How did he get back there without anyone noticing?* Harry pictured Snape sneaking along the line of heavy, black curtains beneath his cloak and suppressed a snort of humour. *He's really not helping himself with those vampire rumours.*

\'I won\'t bother assessing your work, Longbottom.\' Snape vanished the contents of Neville's cauldron. 'The blank mark you get for not turning up would look better than what I'd give you for... *that.*'

Harry winced as he made his way towards the door. *Neville seems to have been my substitute today, poor guy.*

\'Potter, if you'd be so kind as to remain behind,' Snape drawled. He sighed under his breath. *I knew it was too good to be true.* Snape loomed over the rack of vials on his desk and tapped

Harry's with the end of his wand. \'What do you think this is, Potter?\'

Harry struggled to quell his surge of good humour. \'My inevitably ungradable attempt at potions making?\'

Snape's stare remained calm. \'This is a passable attempt. Not the standard I expect from students looking to continue after OWLs, but close enough I might begin to hope of keeping the school\'s most prominent celebrity a little longer.\'

*Wow. That sounded almost like a backhanded compliment.*

\'Thank you, sir.'

Snape sneered. \'You finally deciding to apply what I\'ve been fruitlessly filling your head with is promising, but no less than the wizarding world demands from someone of your elated stature. Do not slip back into your previous levels of mediocrity.\'

\'I\'ll try my best, sir.\' Harry edged toward the door.

\'See that you do.\' Snape disappeared into his office in a swirl of cloak and robes.

*Right.*

Professor McGonagall shot him a tight-lipped glance as he slipped into the back row of desks. A cage of guinea fowl clucked atop her desk, bobbing their heads about like chickens.

\'Today, we will be transfiguring guinea fowl into guinea pigs.\' Their stern professor flicked her wand and the cages floated across to deposit themselves in front of each student. \'This type of transformation is as complex as any we will attempt this year, but the helpful association of the name makes it a good starting point for us all.\'

The level of clucking escalated as the class fell to wand waving and quiet cursing.

Harry eyed his bird. *I wonder if they get the animals from the kitchens. Maybe I should avoid poultry for the next few days in case I end up eating Neville's.*

\'Very good, Miss Granger, take ten points.\' Professor McGonagall\'s voice rang out from the head of the class.

Harry raised an eyebrow in the general direction of Hermione's sparsely feathered guinea pig and its talons. *Generous for McGonagall. She must be happy to be back at school.*

Hermione glowed with pride.

He cast a look around the room. Seamus' fowl's feathers were

turning green and Ron\'s had plucked itself.

*Ron's probably thinking about lunch.*

\'Harry.\' Hermione nudged his elbow. \'Aren\'t you even going to try?

It\'s not that hard, you know.\'

He swallowed a flicker of irritation. *Time to put my summer of study to use.* Harry pictured the bird changing into a guinea pig, imagining feathers shrinking back to short fur, wings shifting into legs, and a beak shivering into a small, dark nose. He tapped the guinea fowl on the head, earning a disgruntled squawk.

Hermione let out a sharp sigh. \'That\'s not the proper wand action, Harry. You have to---'

The guinea fowl morphed into a perfect guinea pig and Harry shot her a beatific smile.

\'But --- but... That was your *first* try.\' Hermione poked his guinea pig with her wand. \'It took me almost *five*.\'

\'Five!\' Harry plastered an expression of shock over his broad grin. \'It\'s not that hard, you know.\'

Hermione huffed and turned to watch Ron, whose guinea fowl was beginning to look more and more like it had been roasted.

*He's starting to make me hungry now, too.*

\'Well done, Mr Potter.\' Professor McGonagall appeared over his shoulder and Harry flinched. \'Twenty points to Gryffindor for a perfect species-switch transfiguration. I daresay you might have inherited your father\'s talent for my subject --- as well as his tendency to overlook the rules.\'

Hermione crossed her arms and jabbed her wand at her guinea pig until the last few feathers had vanished and its feet lost their bird-like aspect. \'I can\'t believe you did that on your first try, Harry. That\'s *really* lucky. Still, twenty points for Gryffindor is good!\'

*Lucky? Really?* He rolled his eyes. *I suppose I've not demonstrated much consistent success before.*

A loud bang echoed from the row behind. Neville\'s guinea fowl

cage rolled along the floor, sending Seamus' bottle of water flying.

Professor McGonagall levitated the cage back onto the desk. 'Focus on the outcome you desire, Mr Longbottom. Don\'t just wave your wand about like a baby\'s rattle.\'

Harry watched the water stream toward Hermione\'s bag and pile of books. *A disaster in the making. If it gets wet, we'll lose half the school library.*

Hermione scrambled to save her things as Harry vanished the liquid with his wand tucked under his arm. \'Thank you, professor,\' she exclaimed.

\'Pardon me, Miss Granger?\' Professor McGonagall lowered the stack of paper in her hands.

\'Nothing, professor.\' Hermione frowned. \'Vanishing is an advanced fifth year spell,\' she muttered. \'I can\'t do a vanishing spell yet. If I could, I'd use it on Ron\'s stupid quidditch posters.\'

Harry laughed and tucked his wand back into his sleeve. *Best not let her realise it was me after I already did the guinea pig spell so well.*

Hermione pulled out a thick book and a small piece of parchment.

She poked it with the tip of her wand, whispering the vanishing spell's

incantation over and over.

Harry studied the edges of the torn fragment as they started to fade. *It's not taking her long to get the hang of it. Hopefully she's not going to insist on trying all day, though.*

He packed his things away as Professor McGonagall dismissed them and hurried to the Great Hall for lunch.

Ron groaned. 'No chicken.'

Harry snorted. 'I did think your guinea fowl was starting to look like you were hoping to have it for lunch.'

*I wonder if he was imagining how it would taste when he was trying to transfigure it. That might explain what happened.*

'Mum does do a mean bird roast.' Ron sighed and hacked off a huge piece of ham. 'Oh well, gammon's not so bad.'

\'What did Snape want, Harry?\' Neville asked between bites of a fist-thick sandwich.

\'Told me my work was finally passable and that I shouldn\'t slide back into mediocrity.\' Harry watched several slices of radish escape Neville\'s lunch and make a bid for freedom across the table.

They rolled only as far as Ron, who speared them on his fork and gulped them down in between bites of gammon.

\'That was awfully nice of him.\' Ron sniggered. \'Did he deduct points to compensate as well?\'

\'No. He didn\'t take any points off me today actually. Maybe he's

ill.\'

\'Odd, normally at least ten are gone in our first potions lesson,

maybe he was happy about something and forgot,' Seamus said.

\'What would Snape be happy about?\' Ron asked.

\'He\'s probably anticipating failing us for all our OWL exams.\' Neville stared down into his sandwich like it was Professor Trelawney's crystal ball. \'My gran will kill me if I don\'t get at least 6 OWLs like my father did.\'

\'It\'s two years away, Nev,\' Ron said. \'Harry has to go through two near-death experiences first, you\'ve got a *huge* advantage.\'

The table laughed. Hermione glanced up at the sound, jabbing her wand at the piece of parchment and picking pieces of salad off her place with her free hand.

\'I\'ve had my near-death experience for this year, thanks,\' Harry

said.

\'It doesn\'t count, mate,\' Ron replied. \'The Bulgarian cheerleader

cancels it out.\'

The guys nodded.

\'She wasn\'t *that* gorgeous, Ron,\' Harry replied. \'And all she did was carry me while I was unconscious. Hardly anything to be proud of.\'

\'She was a *veela*, Harry,\' Dean said. \'Those legends about the sirens in the Odyssey are supposed to be based on veela. You\'ve outdone Odysseus.\'

Seamus, Ron, and Neville shot him blank looks.

\'It\'s a really famous story!\' Dean waved his hands in the air. \'How could you have not heard of it? Harry, Hermione, back me up. Everyone knows about the Odyssey.\'

Hermione jabbed her wand at the piece of parchment again.

*She's really not taking it well. I suppose I should come clean.*

Harry leant over Hermione\'s shoulder and tapped his wand against the small fragment of parchment. It faded away like smoke into the breeze.

Hermione whirled around like a viper. \'How did you do that?\' she hissed. \'I\'ve been trying since transfiguration.\'

\'It\'s not too tricky, you just have to visualise what you want to happen and really focus when you perform the spell. The better idea you have of it, the easier you pick it up.\' The corner of his mouth twitched. \'I found imagining things disappearing came to me pretty naturally.\'

She huffed and reached for another piece of parchment. Harry caught her hand. \'It\'s an advanced OWL year spell,

Hermione. You've got plenty of time to practise it. Can\'t have you starving

first. And someone needs to help Dean and I defend the Odyssey.\' \'The Odyssey?\'

\'See,\' Ron crowed. \'Hermione doesn\'t know about it and that means virtually nobody does.\'

Hermione shook her head. \'I know about the Odyssey, Ron. It\'s one of the most famous stories ever written and it\'s over two thousand years old, but I have no idea why you\'re all talking about it.\'

Seamus gulped. \'Er... Dean said there're veela in it.'

\'Are attractive, part-human women all you boys ever think about?\' Her flush faded to a frown. \'I assume he was referring to the sirens that Odysseus encounters.\'

Harry nodded.

\'He\'s probably right,\' she said. \'But you can\'t *still* be thinking about the Bulgarian cheerleaders! Their charm only works when you\'re actually looking at them.\'

Ron adopted a dreamy expression. \'They were *goddesses*.\'

Hermione crossed her arms and sighed. '*Boys.*'

Ron, Seamus, and Dean began to whisper about veela.

Hermione slid the jug of pumpkin juice in between Harry and their conversation. \'How did you get so good at transfiguration so quickly?'

*Ah, so she's realised it wasn't just luck after all.*

\'I spent the summer reading up on all the theory. I never bothered before because I\'d just picture what I wanted to happen and with a bit of practice I\'d get the hang of it. It worked alright for me in most subjects, but now I actually know the details about what I'm doing, I\'d imagine transfiguration will be one of my best. It's quite visual, which suits me. My dad was supposed to be really good at it, too.\'

\'Oh.\' Hermione chewed her lip. \'I'm sorry, Harry. I didn\'t know he

was so good at transfiguration.\'

Harry laughed. \'He and his friends were animagi during their mid- school years. You realise that even basic human transfiguration isn\'t covered until our last two years, let alone full animagus transformations.\'

\'That does make sense.\' Hermione's lips twisted and contorted into a smile. \'It\'s good you\'ve started studying seriously, Harry. I hope you keep doing so well.'

\'Time for charms.\' Ron threw a long look at the food, dragging his bag out from under the table and hauled himself to his feet.

Flitwick perched on a stack of books at the front of his classroom. \'Repairing, summoning, and banishing charms,\' he squeaked as they entered.

Harry frowned. *Hermione's going to be cross with me again. I*

*know two of these already.*

\'We\'ll be starting with the mending charm and moving on to the others after Christmas.\' Flitwick waved his wand at the year plan on the board. 'Theory first, I'm afraid.'

Ron groaned. \'Not a theory lesson.\'

Quills scratched over parchment as the class resigned themselves to taking notes. Harry flicked a little further through the textbook to the banishing charm. Hermione opened her book to the same page.

Harry smiled and skipped the history of the charm, scanning the paragraphs on its specific theory. *Summoning, but in reverse. Let's give it a try.*

He whispered the incantation and aimed it at the ink pot of Zacharias Smith, a rather pretentious Hufflepuff. A soft ripple of air crossed the class, fading out before it reached his target. Harry tried again. The pot slid across the desk, spilling ink across Zacharias\' notes.

Harry returned his wand to his sleeve as the Hufflepuff student glared around the room. *Apart from the essays, I should do pretty well this year at Charms.*

'Sir! Sir!' Zacharias waved parchment spattered with poisonous green ink in the direction of Professor Flitwick. 'Someone ruined my work, sir!'

*Basilisk green.*

'Ok, that'll do for this lesson.' Flitwick waved his wand and the door to the classroom creaked open. 'I'll see you all next time.'

Hermione stacked her books back into her bag. \'Did you flick any further through the book, Harry?\'

\'Not really,\' he said. \'I skimmed some bits. The summoning and banishing charm both looked quite useful.\'

Hermione beamed. \'They do. Summoning is a very useful charm, it will save everyone so much time at the library.\'

\'Madam Pince will murder you if she catches you summoning her

books, Hermione,' Harry replied, grinning.

\'What she doesn\'t know won\'t upset her.\' Hermione bounced

along the corridor. 'It's not actually against the rules, anyway. I checked.'

Ron stumbled after them, rubbing his eyes and yawning. 'Of

course you checked the rules,' he muttered. 'If I wrote a fancy looking list

that said all girls have to sit on the floor in the common room, you'd be

cross-legged by the fire before I could blink.'

Hermione shot him a glare. \'Harry, you said you found you were good at the visual bits, so in return for lending my notes for essays, would you give me some pointers for casting the spells themselves?\'

\'Of course. You don\'t really need them, but if you want to, that's

fine.\'

She bobbed her head. \'I understand all the theory, of course, but

my spells never work the first time. I thought it might be worth trying how you visualise them and seeing if it works quicker for me.\'

\'I learnt a good way of focusing,\' Harry said. \'I\'ve some mind- clearing exercises I found over the summer. Muggle stuff, but I doubt the magical versions are much different. I can teach you the muggle ones, but it turns out all the mind magic stuff is in the restricted section.\'

'Good idea,\' Hermione said. \'Ron needs those, too. All he does is

think about how long is left until the next meal.\' Ron threw her a mutinous look.

Harry laughed. 'She's not entirely wrong, mate.' 'She didn't have to say it like that,' Ron groused.

\'I\'m going to the library,\' Hermione announced. \'I want to get the essay out of the way before all the other professors give their first homework as well. Come on, Ron. If you want me to help you, it's now or never.\' She skipped past the portrait entrance to the tower, trailed by a crestfallen Ron.

Harry murmured the password and slipped in through passage to a chair close to the fire. The other students flooded upstairs to the dormitories.

'Last chance for casual quidditch!' Katie shouted from somewhere in the huddle. 'Observers are welcome, but will still get judged for not playing!'

The common room emptied. Harry stared into the fire.

The glowing ash and smoke brought back images of the smouldering, burning camp at the World Cup. A soft little whisper of need coiled in his breast. *I wonder if I can do it again.* He pictured the serpent he'd conjured from the ash and slashed his wand at the fire.

The flames rippled and settled back into the grate.

'Maybe I need to be more detailed.' Harry imagined the basilisk forming from fire, picturing the red-tongues of flame curling into the shape of a serpent and striking.

A flaming basilisk lunged from the fireplace, fangs agape.

He threw himself backward out of his chair and the heat washed past his face, singeing his cheeks.

'Idiot.' He pushed himself back to his feet, swearing under his breath and brushing ash and dust off his robes. His heart pounded like a hammer against his ribs. 'You nearly set fire to yourself.'

Harry glanced at the flames and back around the empty common room. *No. It's a bad idea.* He stuffed his wand back up his sleeve and let himself sink into the circle of blank ink on parchment until the temptation faded. *I can try again later. Somewhere quieter. Somewhere safer.*

# The Secrets of the Chamber

Harry stared at the snake engraved tap, tracing the cold metal of the small, silver squiggle with his fingertip. \'Open.\'

It remained quite still.

Myrtle giggled and drifted from her cubicle. \'It doesn\'t work if you

don\'t speak to snakes.'

\'I *can* speak to snakes.'

\'Well, you were only speaking English.' Myrtle flashed him a shy smile. 'I never did say thank you for killing the monster. You avenged me, Harry.\'

\'Er, thanks Myrtle.\' He edged away as she drifted within arm's reach. 'I --- er, appreciate it.' Harry pictured a particular fire-conjured snake in his head. \'Open.'

The tap shuddered and the sinks split apart to reveal the entrance. A thick layer of slime, grime, and sludge coated the pipe that curved down into the dark.

Myrtle cheered. \'That\'s more like it!'

*She's half-pretty when she smiles.* Harry frowned and stamped that thought out. *This is one of those puberty things, isn't it? Come on, hormones, let's not make me act like Dudley.*

\'It sounds the same to me,\' he said. \'I can\'t tell if I\'m speaking parseltongue just by listening.\'

\'That was definitely parseltongue. It sounded just like before.\'

Myrtle's face fell. \'When *he* used to come here.\'

\'Sorry. I didn\'t mean to remind you.\'

\'That\'s okay, Harry. You weren\'t the one responsible. I blame Olive Hornby more than him, anyway.\' Myrtle\'s face twisted into a grimace. 'Stupid Horny, she got me killed.'

Harry pursed his lips at the slimy pipe. 'I forgot about how dirty it is. Honestly, where's Dobby when you actually need him?' He sighed. 'Probably out somewhere trying to harm or grievously injure another innocent child.'

\'There are steps, you know.\' Myrtle hovered over the entrance and peered into the pipe. \'The red-haired girl who spoke in *his* voice made steps.\'

*Stairs.*\'

He spared the brown sludge a long look. 'Definitely worth trying.

The pipe twisted away to reveal a rather dusty, dark staircase. Harry followed a small set of footsteps down through the dust

into the dark. *Ginny\'s steps*. His skin crawled as the silent gloom coiled round him. *Poor girl.*

A second door identical to the one he'd encountered on his last visit blocked his path. It opened at his hissed command and he stepped into the Chamber of Secrets.

Bones crunched beneath his feet as he strode forward. The giant snake skin sprawled across the floor; its green gleam faded to dull white. Beyond it, bright, iridescent poisonous green scales shone in the faint light.

Harry paced the length of it. *How did I manage to survive that monster, let alone kill it? It's at least seventy feet long!* He drifted round to its mouth and held his arm up beside its fangs. *They're as long and thick as my forearm.*

'King of serpents indeed.' Harry trailed his fingertips along its cold scales. 'It's identical to the one I conjured, just much larger.'

A dark stain marked the stone close to its tail. Harry shot it a glare and stepped over it to stand before the giant bust. *I wonder if I can open the door, too.*

\'Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts four.\' The mouth opened with a stony scrape.

Chill fingers seized Harry's spine. *There better not be another giant snake. Why did I open the bloody door?*

\'What a ridiculous way to open the door, it responds to virtually any command in parseltongue, you know.\' A high, even voice echoed from within the bust.

Harry stared into the dark beyond the bust's lips. *Well, it's not Tom Riddle. Riddle would never make fun of his own ostentatious phrasing.*

\'And no, I won\'t speak to you.\'

*That can\'t possibly be the voice of Salazar Slytherin.* Harry eyed the water. *Well, finding out is probably worth getting very cold and wet.*

*Just. Still, if there were stairs...*

\'Bridge?\' Harry grinned as a stone a serpent\'s tongue rose from the pool, extending as if from the mouth of Slytherin himself. He put one foot on the forked tip of the tongue.

\'Oh, by all means come in,\' the voice said. \'I\'d *love* another visitor. My other company all turned out delightfully well. An insane reptile and an only marginally more sane child with delusions of grandeur.\'

Harry strode across the bridge and into Slytherin\'s mouth.

Shelves of dusty books lined the circular walls, interspersed with odd magical instruments, and a carved marble basin rather like the one he'd often glimpsed in Dumbledore\'s cabinet sat opposite the door.

'The other one stood there and gawped, too.\'

Harry whirled round. The portrait of a young, formidable looking wizard dressed in green and silver robes hung over the door. A snake wrapped itself around his shoulders just below where his ebony hair hung.

\'Well, you look sane,\' the portrait mused. \'But the last one did too and look how well *that* turned out.\'

\'Who are you?\' Harry asked.

\'Portraits are *named*.\' The dark-haired wizard sighed. \'I always hated children.\'

\'Salazar Slytherin... If you hate children, why found a school?\'

\'It wasn\'t safe for magical children to just learn their craft all over the place. Don\'t you know anything about the burnings?\' The sarcasm sharpened to bitter disgust.

\'Witch burnings?\'

\'Sort of. The muggles couldn\'t actually burn witches and wizards, but they got a fair few of our children after they were seen performing accidental magic. Burning children alive.\' Slytherin's eyes flashed. \'And they called *us* evil. Hogwarts was a haven for magical children. They were taught how to control and even hide themselves for their own safety.\'

\'You don\'t leave a basilisk that eats children in a school!\' \'She was meant to sleep until the school was under attack,\'

Slytherin snapped. \'A basilisk is very hard to kill, especially for those

without magic. Had anyone ever tried to get to the children here, she

would have protected them with her life. It worked perfectly until my last visitor twisted my commands to his own ends.\'

\'Tom Riddle,\' Harry muttered.

\'Yes. Basilisks are renowned not only for their power, but their loyalty, too. She devoted herself to her creator and my command to protect the children from the outside world. Tom Riddle corrupted my creation and set her on the children who'd come from the outside world to learn here.\'

Harry felt a small stab of pity for the serpent. \'It\'s a good thing

she\'s dead, then.'

\'Dead?\' Slytherin raised an eyebrow. \'Who managed to kill her?\'

\'I did.'

\'You are my heir, I suppose. You would be powerful.\' \'I am *not* your heir,\' Harry said.

*I'm not going through all that nonsense again.*

Slytherin took a deep breath and pinched the bridge of his nose. \'You speak parseltongue. It's an ability I recreated and is tied to my bloodline. Only my direct descendants can speak it, and as I have no desire to ever see Tom Riddle again, that makes you my heir.\'

\'Sorry,\' Harry mumbled. \'The school all thought I was your heir in my second year when the basilisk was attacking students. They blamed me.\'

\'You can\'t really blame them. You *do* speak parseltongue. I assume you\'re in my house?\'

\'Gryffindor, actually.\'

\'Gryffindor!? What is my descendant, my heir, doing in the house of that reckless, moronic, immature excuse for a wizard? The whole reason I had to build this chamber was because that child of a man couldn\'t resist his urge to sabotage my work...' Slytherin's voice faded to a grumble. 'And all Helga would do is laugh.\'

'That doesn't sound like Godric Gryffindor.'

\'Did you think he was a noble, brave hero?\' Slytherin shook his head. \'That wizard never matured beyond the age of eighteen. He was an exceptional transfigurer, quite brilliant and very creative, but cursed with a child\'s sense of humour. Most of the things he *did* around this school were actually done by Rowena and I after the idiot injured himself trying to enchant things in overly complicated ways.\'

\'I\'m quite good at transfiguration,\' Harry offered. \'The hat did suggest Slytherin, but I chose Gryffindor.\'

\'Why would you do that? Who'd want to live in a tower when they could have a view out into the Black Lake?\' Slytherin's wand spurted white sparks and the snake retreated into his robes. 'And Godric himself? That man had *no* sense. His precious griffons? Stupid creatures. About as smart as a cow, much deadlier, and far less useful.\'

Harry stared at the ceiling until the muttering faded away. \'I\'m Harry Potter.\' He stuck his hand out to the picture.

\'Salazar Slytherin. I can\'t shake it, but I appreciate your manners.\'

\'I think I have to go to class now.'

\'How old are you?\' \'Fourteen.\'

Slytherin's stare bored into his. \'Your eyes are older. You're my heir, return here whenever you like. My library and study are yours, provided you\'re tidy and not as childish as Godric.\'

\'Thank you.'

Harry strode back over the forked tongue and jogged up the stairs, taking them three at a time until he stumbled into Myrtle's bathroom. *I'm probably really late for Ancient Runes.*

He hurried past the Great Hall and down the corridor, catching sight of Professor Babbling doing her best to live up to her name amongst a gaggle of seventh years. Harry slipped past her to join Hermione in the front row.

The walls were covered in multi-coloured posters, the office door itself was wrapped in parchment and covered in tiny sections of text.

'Sorry, everyone! Just catching up with one of my other classes!' Professor Babbling bounced into the classroom and spread her arms. \'Welcome back to Ancient Runes! Happily, everyone survived from third year. We even have an additional student, one who needs no introduction.\'

The students turned to look at him, his scar, and twisted back to face their smiling professor.

\'I trust you\'ve all brought your copies of *Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms*.\' Professor Babbling plucked hers off the desk and waved it over her head. \'As this is the first lesson, I\'ll allow you to recap anything you feel you need to or just get started on the material for this year while I chat with Harry.\' She smiled at him and gestured toward the parchment- covered door. 'Mind joining me in my office, Harry?\'

\'Of course not, professor.\' Harry abandoned his well-thumbed textbook.

She led him into a small, cramped room with walls covered in a patchwork of large pieces of parchment. Runes and notes were scrawled all across it in a dozen different bright colours.

Professor Babbling waved her hand at the walls. \'My office is my playground. Now, if you don't mind telling me, why did you decide to switch to my class, Harry?\'

\'I find runes interesting. It's quite different to the wand magic I'm kind of used to and, if I\'m being completely honest, Professor Trelawney was a bit *too* fond of predicting my death.\'

\'How horrible,\' Professor Babbling said. \'I\'m glad you've a genuine interest in the subject. This is a small group and we tend to move quite fast, so anyone not completely on board can get left behind.\' Her gaze focused on something just past Harry\'s head. \'Back to class, then. I won\'t pass your concerns about Professor Trelawney on. Just between the two of us, I\'ve never really had time for a subject as imprecise and vague as divination.\'

Harry spared a glance at the wall as he left. A bright pink zig-zag and a small, neat paragraph of handwriting stood out of the rest. *Sowilo.* He touched a finger to his scar as he took his seat beside Hermione. *Stupid Voldemort, just had to leave a scar in a funny shape, didn't he?*

He flicked through the pages of his book, underlining key parts with his quill and jotting the references down in the margin.

Time crawled by with the faint tick of the clock and the rustle of parchment.

\'What did Professor Babbling want?\' Hermione asked as the lesson came to an end.

\'She just wanted to know why I switched to Ancient Runes and to warn me about how fast the class will move.\'

\'We do go fast, but if you\'re already ahead in transfiguration then you\'ll be able to redistribute your time and keep up.\' She beamed. \'Why *did* you switch, then?\'

\'I told you. I got a bit tired of being told how I was going to die every lesson.\' Harry shrugged. 'It was kind of funny for a while, but then she started repeating her predictions and the novelty wore off.'

Hermione shook her head and rummaged through her bag. \'It\'s Arithmancy now. I\'ve got the notes from last year somewhere in here. I thought you might like them.\'

Harry accepted the thick stack of parchment with a smile. *I'd prefer your notes from Ancient Runes, really. There're no really long essays for Arithmancy.*

He scanned the pages as Professor Vector arranged her students into a precise seating plan that seemed as much about having everyone sat in a symmetrical pattern as it did learning.

'Recap lesson today.' Professor Vector fiddled with the brim of her hat and glanced at Harry. 'At the end, if you struggled with any of the questions on the board, stay afterward and we'll go over them to make sure you're all ready to start the new stuff.'

Harry pushed his glasses up his nose and jotted down the answers to the first two, then paused and read through the questions. *Oh, that's a bit disappointing. These are all just basic ones.*

Hermione glanced up. \'Are you stuck, Harry? Professor Vector

won't mind if you want some help.\'

He rolled his eyes. \'This isn\'t the sort of Arithmancy I\'m particularly interested in. In fact, I've a nasty feeling that most of the interesting stuff isn\'t covered until after OWLs.\'

She chewed her lip. \'Advanced Arithmancy is supposed to be one of the hardest classes. Are you sure?\'

\'Of course. This is just the basics. Two-dimensional equations to help people understand what to do. After OWLs, they cover all the complex, interesting stuff. Two-dimensional equations are useless to describe magical patterns when any magic we fold into planes for warding or enchanting will be done in reality, an obviously three-dimensional construct.\' Harry cocked his head. 'Four, technically, since magic's affected by time, too.'

Hermione blinked. \'I guess that does make sense, but you\'ll still need to know how to do this if you want to be able to do advanced things like that.\'

Harry leant across and filled in the answer to the last question on her parchment. \'See, easy.\'

Hermione huffed and scribbled out his answer. Harry returned to his doodling.

He'd just finished adding scales to the head of his Arithmancy basilisk when Professor Vector stood up and added the answers to the board with a flick of her wand.

*One. Two. Three. Four. Five...* Harry skimmed through the remaining questions. *Ah, got one wrong, but that's what you get for copying down the original question incorrectly.*

Hermione stuffed her books back into her bag and stalked toward the Great Hall. Harry tailed her at a more comfortable pace, squeezing in between her and Ron midway along the Gryffindor table.

Ron squinted at him with bleary eyes. \'Divination was absolute hell without you, mate,\' he mumbled. \'I had to partner with Lavender. She was so *keen*. It was no fun at all.\'

Hermione picked at her food in silence, stabbing at pieces of

lettuce like they'd done her grave personal injury.

\'What\'s your horoscope, Ron?\' Harry asked. 'Any eternal glory in

there?'

\'Well, I\'m not going to die, so it beats whatever yours would've

been. Lavender mentioned something to do with fire, cups, and veela, but I think she was talking to Parvati about the Quidditch World Cup.\'

*Lavender hates quidditch even more than she loves gossip.*

Harry patted Ron on the shoulder. \'You slept through the whole

thing, didn\'t you?'

\'It\'s so warm and stuffy. I don\'t know how anyone stays awake up

there.\'

Neville laughed. 'No need for anyone to stir themselves, it's

History of Magic next. Even my gran says the subject's a waste of time

while Binns is still teaching it.\'

\'You know they say his body is actually still in his office from when he died and he just kept teaching as a ghost,\' Seamus said.

\'Aren\'t ghosts meant to have a reason to linger?\' Ron asked

Seamus sniggered. \'Maybe he hadn\'t finished marking essays.'

\'How does he mark our essays?\' Dean wondered. \'He can\'t exactly touch them, can he?\'

\'Maybe that\'s why he never notices we don\'t hand anything in,'

Ron said, grinning.

'Let's go,' Hermione snapped. 'We'll be late otherwise.'

Harry wandered after them, settling himself at the back of the class as Binns began to drone.

Heads began to drop as Binns floated through his desk, staring at the ceiling.

He glanced up from *A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration* as Binns drifted into the wall. *Ghosts do not make good teachers. Especially not ones that were boring even when they were alive.*

'In this year, there were twelve hundred and forty two skirmishes between goblins and men.' Binns' voice echoed from the corridor outside. 'The most in any single year.'

*Why is this subject compulsory?*

Hermione crossed her arms, dragged out some parchment and started on the first of their homework essays. Ron slumped onto his arm and started to snore.

'Oi.' Harry nudged him on the shoulder. 'Whassat?' Ron cracked open an eye.

'Don't snore so loud. I'm trying to read and everyone else is trying to sleep.'

'Why're you *reading?*'

'Because I would very much like to be able to do some of this magic one day and even if we won't start using this book for a couple more years in class, it's still cool to read about.'

Ron grunted. 'Fair enough, mate, but I'm just going to take a nap.'

Harry turned back to *A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration* and

skimmed down the page to where he'd left off. *Famous animagi. Stark*

*warning about getting stuck in your newly transfigured body forever. Animagus theory.* He read the first two lines. *Wow, that's a lot of things that could potentially go very badly wrong. Maybe this is something for a later date after all.*

Harry swapped the book for his copy of *Confronting the Faceless* and propped it up on the desk with the index pages showing. *There're a lot of curses.* He paused on one. *Purple cutting curse adaption. Incantation lacero. That's the one Barty Crouch Junior tried to use on me, that and the Cruciatus Curse.*

Harry flicked to the section on Unforgivable Curses. *Cruciatus Curse, best avoided, Imperius Curse, also best avoided, even if it's the only one you can defend against.* He traced the scar on his forehead, remembering dreams that always ended with a flash of bright green light.

*And the Killing Curse...*

\'Avada Kedavra,\' he murmured.

*I've always known the words to this one.* He recalled attempting to correct a magician at one of Dudley\'s birthday parties when he'd been much younger, knowing it was wrong, but not quite knowing why. *Strange, that of all the things I could've remembered from that night, it was that.*

# Unforgiveables

White clouds drifted across the ceiling of the Great Hall. Harry watched them float from one side to the other as he munched on his toast.

'When does the tournament start again, Hermione?' Ron asked. \'It\'s only been a few days since the beginning of term, Ron.'

Hermione shook her head. 'You really need to learn some patience.'

\'It feels like we\'ve been here for ages.\' Ron reached for the nearest

rack of toast. '*Ages.*'

*\'We* were here a bit earlier, but still, it\'s barely September.

Nothing's happening until October.\'

\'It\'s a travesty,\' Ron mumbled around a mouthful of toast. \'All that hype about the bloody tournament and we have to wait until October to enter.\'

Hermione's eyes narrowed. 'Don't swear.'

Ron twitched out of elbow range.

\'Not much point entering now, mate,\' Dean said. \'Got to wait for the other two schools first.\'

\'Are you going to enter?\' Seamus asked.

\'Nope,\' Dean replied. \'I choose life. I did some research about it when I heard. It\'s been cancelled for centuries because all the champions kept dying before the end.\'

\'Doesn\'t sound like eternal glory to me,\' Neville piped up.

Ron chomped his way through the rest of the toast rack and ladled half a plateful of eggs in front of himself.

*Where does all the food even go?*

Seamus grinned. \'Sounds like unexpected death to me. Still, I\'m entering. They\'ll have made it safer or something now, I\'m sure. Otherwise they wouldn't have been allowed to bring it back.\'

Ron emerged from behind his mountain of eggs. \'Well, if you see a basilisk, just summon Harry and hide for a bit. That ought to do the trick.\'

Dean sniggered. \'That\'s pretty much the plan. I\'ll let the seventh years know. They\'re the ones who\'ll get chosen anyway. The tournament is supposed to have the best possible student chosen from all the entered names.\'

\'How does it know?\' Neville asked. Dean shrugged. 'Some magic, I guess.' Everyone turned to look at Hermione.

\'What?\' She huffed and crossed her arms. \'I\'m not interested in a silly tournament, we\'re almost at *OWL* year now.\'

\'That\'s a point,\' Harry said. \'I\'d wager the champions will all be sixth years really. No NEWT or OWL exams to worry about that year.\'

Ron's chewing halted. 'Nah. Nobody's going to care about exams more than the tournament. I'm definitely entering. Can you imagine Percy\'s face if I won?\'

Harry laughed.

\'You\'d get another howler from your mum,\' Dean said.

\'Worth it for eternal glory.\' Ron's eyes turned distant and a little misty. \'Pretty much everyone in Gryffindor is putting their name in, even some of the firsties wanted to.\'

\'House of the brave,\' Seamus said.

\'House of the brave and Neville.\' Dean prodded Neville on the arm. \'Maybe you\'ll be champion, Nev. Up for it?\'

Neville paled. \'I prefer to leave that stuff to Harry. Giant snakes, swords, dark lords, and lethal tournaments are his area of expertise.\'

Ron grunted. \'It\'s about time it was someone else\'s turn.'

\'Madam Pomfrey might not let you out next time, mate,\' Seamus

said.

\'We\'ve got double Defence with Mad-eye,\' Neville said. \'Madam

Pomfrey might be seeing all of us if what I\'ve heard is true.\' \'Oh?\' Harry swivelled round. \'What did you hear?\'

*Given the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor has nearly killed me every single year, it'd probably be smart to keep an eye on this one from the beginning.*

\'Apparently he\'s been talking about the Unforgivable Curses.' Neville's voice shrank to a tiny whisper.

\'Bit of an odd thing to teach,\' Dean muttered.

*No argument here. Still, dark wizards seem more dangerous than*

*most creatures, so it'll be useful.*

\'It\'s probably useful,' Ron said. \'Dad says those three spells are

hard to cast, but very dangerous.\'

Dean glanced at the clock. \'We\'re about to find out.'

A nervous gaggle of students huddled behind the desks in Mad- eye Moody\'s classroom when Harry arrived and took a seat in the middle of the pack.

\'Oi! Potter!\' Malfoy sneered at him over Hermione's head. \'How'd you enjoy the World Cup? I heard you collapsed again. Saw a dementor did you?\'

\'No, Malfoy.\' Harry gritted his teeth and swallowed a flare of anger. \'I did see a blond man in black hooded robes, though. Did your father enjoy his after-party?\'

Malfoy recoiled as if struck. \'My father had nothing to do with that. As if it wasn\'t enough that you pranced around with mudbloods and blood- traitors, you\'ve lowered yourself to slander too.\' He turned away to Pansy Parkinson.

*Slander's all you manage on a day-to-day basis, you slimy cockroach.*

\'Ignore him, Harry.\' Hermione covered his wand arm with her

hand.

Ron stuck his wand at Malfoy's back. 'Ve---'

Professor Moody stomped in the room and Ron stuffed his wand

back into his robes. Purple veins clustered in the deep gash through the professor's nose and his electric-blue, magical eye whirled across the room. It flicked from student to student, peering into the shadows around the edges of the room.

\'I am Alastor Moody.\' He heaved himself past the desks to the front, his wooden leg clunked on the stone floor with each step. \'I served as an auror in the war against the Dark Lord. I\'ve seen almost all there is of

the dark arts and not from a practitioner\'s perspective.\' He snatched a large, bell-shaped jar from under his desk and hauled it onto the front row.

Three large spiders sat inside, hunching into their long, hairy legs.

Ron\'s chair scraped backward and thudded into the bench behind him.

Moody's mouth twisted into a grimace. \'When it comes to the dark arts, I believe in a practical approach. There\'s nothing out there that will really prepare you for what\'s to come. Pictures in a book look nothing like the real horror. When you can taste and smell it all around you. I survived the war, but it cost me an eye and a leg and more to do so. Most didn't survive at all.\' He unscrewed the top of the bell jar with stiff, jerky motions and placed it on the desk. \'There are only three curses that will get you a lifetime ticket to Azkaban if performed or attempted on another human being. Can anyone name any of them?\'

\'The Imperius Curse,\' Malfoy said with only the slightest hint of a

sneer.

\'You\'d know all about that one, wouldn\'t you, boy?\' Professor

Moody barked. \'I\'d wager your father told you about it. He used it as an excuse to escape that very same ticket to Azkaban.\'

Malfoy's sneer flushed red and he balled his fists under the desk.

Professor Moody levitated a spider out of the jar and onto the desk. \'Nasty curse, the Imperius. Gives complete control of the victim to the caster. The ministry had terrible trouble with it, because if the caster knows what they're doing, it\'s very hard to tell when anyone is under it. It is, however, the only one of three that can be defended against. A strong- willed wizard or witch can fight it off.\'

Professor Moody raised a thick, notched wand and thrust it at the spider. \'Imperio.\'

The spider careened around the room, scuttling over students and dancing on desks. Laughter burst up from around the room.

Harry grimaced. *Wouldn't be so funny if it was one of us being*

*made into a helpless puppet, would it?*

Ron gripped the edge of the desk until his knuckles turned white and watched the spider like it was Aragog himself.

\'Another curse?\' Moody directed the spider back onto the desk at

the front. 'Anyone?'

\'The Cruciatus Curse,\' Neville whispered.

\'Yes, Mr Longbottom. The torture curse, its incantation is crucio.\' Moody\'s magical eye froze on Neville\'s face. \'I will not be demonstrating that one in front of the eyes of children.\'

He scooped the spider up and poked it back into the jar with the tip of his wand. \'And the last one?\'

\'The Killing Curse,\' Ron murmured.

\'Speak up, Weasley,\' Moody growled. \'You're correct. The Killing Curse. It cannot be deflected or magically blocked; its only survivor is Mr Potter.\' Professor Moody stared at Harry and his scar as if Voldemort himself was about bubble out of his face and screwed the jar lid back on.

*Good thing he didn't tell us the incantation for it. Malfoy and his lackeys would be out practising it on small animals before the end of the day.*

\'Blimey,\' Ron whispered. \'That was an intense lesson.\'

\'The lesson has not *ended*, Mr Weasley.\' Professor Moody tucked the jar of spiders back under his desk. \'There is a very lengthy chapter on

hex-deflection in the text I recommended for this year, read it before next lesson, either in here or wherever you please.\'

He turned and stomped into his office. Harry glimpsed an array looking glasses and mirror-like artefacts before the door slammed shut.

*I wonder what those do?*

\'Come on,\' Hermione tugged at his arm. \'I want to check on

Neville.\'

*ok.*

*Neville?* Harry glanced around. *He seemed ok, a bit shaken, but*

\'I\'ve got to go get started on Flitwick\'s essay,\' he said. \'I don\'t

want to fall behind.\'

Hermione huffed and folded her arms. 'Fine.'

Harry rolled his eyes and bit his tongue. *As if you don't go off to*

*the library on your own all the time.*

He slipped through Myrtle\'s cubicle and into the Chamber, vanishing the dust on the stairs until Ginny's tiny footprints were gone. *Like it never happened.* Harry paused before the ink stain, then vanished that, too. *Good riddance.*

\'I\'m back.\' He told the statue in parseltongue, watching the door grate open and the tongue-bridge rise out of the water. 'It really does work for any command.'

\'Oh, joy,\' Slytherin snarked. \'Company.\'

'Beggars can't be choosers,' Harry replied as he strode into the

library. 'It's me or Voldemort.'

'You're probably more sane,\' Slytherin said. \'That seemed quick,

though. Decided to skip class, then?\'

\'It\'s been over a day...\'

\'How am I supposed to know?! There aren\'t any windows and the last I knew the year, it was the mid-twentieth century.\'

\'The century is almost over.'

\'Like I care,\' Slytherin muttered. \'I\'m a painting. I will exist until I am destroyed. Time means little to me now.\'

Harry raised an eyebrow. *Godric Gryffindor must've been pretty*

*bad if he was the childish one.*

\'However, for those who have less time and wish for more, I've a pleasant surprise.\' Salazar gestured at his desk with his wand, dislodging his living, serpent necklace.

Harry spotted a slim golden hourglass dangling off a wooden hook. \'A time-turner...'

\'Yes. One of the most valuable things in here.\' Slytherin gathered his serpent back onto his shoulders. \'It can\'t be removed from the Chamber of Secrets, though, I enchanted it.\'

\'That\'s a good thing, very farsighted of you.\'

*Voldemort would wreak havoc with one of these.*

\'I did it so Godric would stop stealing it,\' Slytherin said.

Harry's eyebrows slipped up into his hairline. \'It\'s true, I would've never admitted it otherwise.\'

\'I thought the two of you were supposed to be enemies, not involved in some war of pranks?\'

\'I didn't carry out *pranks*. We just had a healthy spirit of competition. I made all the wards around the castle with Rowena, so he transfigured and enchanted all the gargoyles and suits of armour. When I created the Headmaster\'s office with Helga, he and Rowena snuck off to make some secret room of their own. They were very proud of it. Especially when I couldn\'t find it.'

\'What secret room?\'

\'They called it the Room of Requirement,\' Slytherin said. \'I never found it, but they never found my Chamber of Secrets either.\'

\'Any idea where it is?\' Harry asked. \'Or what it does?\' \'Presumably it is whatever it is required to be, but no, I\'m not sure

exactly where it is or how to find it. I narrowed it down to the seventh floor,

but it'd be a waste of time searching for it when you have all this.\' Slytherin

waved an ostentatious hand around his library.

\'True,\' Harry said. 'I have some magic to practice.\'

\'Not in here you don\'t,\' Slytherin snapped. \'Out into the hall where you won\'t make a mess of everything. Leave the time-turner there, too. It\'s limited to about twelve hours, but you can come down after class and use it to repeat the day whenever you like.\'

*That's a good idea.* Harry strode back across the bridge. *I can get three times as much done as I hoped now.*

\'Reducto.\' He whipped his wand through two sides of a triangle and unleashed the blasting curse at the dead basilisk.

It sputtered out on the poisonous green scales.

*Right. Magically resistant hide.*

\'Reducto.\'

His curse sailed past the snake and struck the pile of bones at the far end of the chamber. They exploded into a cloud of fine dust and settled onto the floor like the ash at the World Cup.

Harry repeated it a few dozen more times, fixing anything that looked like it was meant to be there. *Pretty much got the hang of that one, now.*

\'Have you finished destroying the finest room in this castle?\' Slytherin called.

\'I fixed it afterwards.' Harry wandered back into the library. \'Do

you know anything about using transfiguration and conjuration in duels?\' \'I am *Salazar Slytherin*.'

\'You said Godric Gryffindor was the expert.\'

\'I\'d like to think I know enough to teach a *fourteen year old.* Sit and listen.\'

\'I\'ve used it before.' Harry settled himself in the chair behind the desk. 'Sort of.'

\'You have?\' The snake's head rose up beside Slytherin's ear. 'When? How?'

\'I conjured a basilisk out of ash and killed a wizard who was attacking me.' A weight lifted off his chest as the words tumbled out. 'I didn't mean to kill him. I just didn't want to die.'

\'Good for you.\' Slytherin scratched his chin with the tip of the

snake's tail. \'What was the spell? Serpensortia?\'

\'I didn\'t use a spell, I just waved my wand and... made it happen.'

\'Show me.\'

\'You said not to do magic in here.'

\'So pick me up off the wall and carry me out there. It will be nice to have a change of scenery.\'

Harry picked the portrait off the wall with a groan and staggered over the bridge.

'Watch the water! Watch the water!' Slytherin's wand spurted silver sparks and the snake buried its face in the wizard's robes. 'If you drop me...'

Harry propped him at the side of the chamber and mopped sweat

off his brow. 'Why on earth do you weigh so bloody much?'

\'Is that my basilisk?\' Slytherin asked. \'Yes.\'

\'She grew a lot.\' A small, faint curve smile curved his lips. \'How did you kill her?\'

\'With a sword.'

\'It had better have not been that ridiculously shiny, goblin-made

atrocity Godric used to wave around.'

\'It was exactly that sword.\'

Slytherin's wand exploded in silver sparks and a furious torrent of parseltongue curses spewed from the founder's lips. \'Show me this conjured serpent, then.\'

\'I managed to repeat it with fire,\' Harry said. \'I don\'t know how well water will work.\'

\'Just try, it shouldn\'t really matter.\'

He pictured the basilisk coalescing from the pool just as it had struck from the cloud of ash and slashed his wand forward away from himself. A vast, liquid basilisk maw swept from the pool and crashed against the wall. Spray spattered Harry's robes and face.

\'Well now,\' Slytherin said. 'That\'s a very impressive piece of silent battle-conjuration, especially for someone your age. If you hadn\'t used a serpent, I daresay Godric himself might've deigned to teach you. Not that you'd have learnt anything from that idiot.\'

\'Er, thanks,\' Harry replied.

\'Try again. This time don\'t imagine a striking snake, but one that hovers in the air over the pool.\'

Harry did so. They watched as the water coiled into the form of the king of serpents. A deep, throbbing ache seeped into Harry's body as the vast liquid serpent twisted above the pool. He gritted his teeth, then released the spell before his legs gave out. The water splashed back into the pool.

\'I can imagine how tiring that must have been.\' Slytherin waved his wand at the pool. \'It looks powerful, but draining. That\'s not a spell you should be using until you\'ve got a lot better at directing your magic.\'

\'I have no idea how to do that,\' Harry said.

Slytherin shook his head and muttered something in parseltongue under his breath. \'To conjure and animate something so big requires a great deal of magic. Even in my prime, I'd be capable of wielding it for no more

than a few minutes and you're pouring magic all over the place. Focus only

on the objective of your spell when you cast it.\' Harry struggled to stand.

\'Not now. There are some rituals you can undertake to strengthen both your body and magic.\' He eyed Harry like a snake would a mouse, and the serpent around his neck stared with him. \'I\'d recommend them. They did Tom Riddle a world of good back when he was scrawny little thing like you.\'

\'I\'m not doing anything that wizard did.'

\'You\'re going to use the time-turner aren\'t you?\' Slytherin asked. Harry scowled. \'Yes.\'

\'Then you\'re following in his footsteps already. That time-turner is what made him such a brilliant student. Of course, you\'re rather more sane than he turned out to be. You don\'t have delusions of vengeance against muggles or an over-inflated sense of self-worth, do you?\'

\'Not that I am aware of,\' Harry retorted.

\'Good.\' Slytherin nodded and the snake on his shoulders bobbed its head beside him. \'Use the time-turner, do the rituals, outstrip him, and redeem the title of Heir of Slytherin if you dislike the connotations he gave it so much.\'

Harry carried the portrait back to its resting place. \'I\'m not doing

the rituals.'

\'Suit yourself. It'll make carrying my picture a lot easier if you did.

If you happen to change your mind, you\'ll find the ritual books you\'re looking for in the corner of the library up there.\' The painting pointed to a high spot just behind where the ladder rested.

\'I\'m not doing them.'

\'I\'m not going to force you,\' Slytherin murmured. \'You\'re my heir, the last reputable member of my family as far as I know. I\'ll help you as much as you allow me, especially since you saved me from the insane ramblings of my poor basilisk.\'

\'I\'m not sure I want to ask.'

\'She had nightmares,\' Slytherin replied. \'I think the magic I used to create her, which made her loyal to me, punished her for what she did, even if she believed it was what I wanted. I\'m glad you put her out of her misery. She's free of Tom Riddle and I no longer have to listen to her tortured raving.\'

\'Where did she go?\' Harry asked. \'I just walked in here and found the study. It\'s far too tidy to have housed a seventy foot serpent.\'

\'She slept underneath. If you intended to wake her, any parseltongue command would've brought her forth. You wanted to open the door, so you came here. A good thing too, since you probably wouldn\'t have been able to get out of her resting place had you fallen down there.\'

Harry threw a glance around the study and measured the depth of the ache in his limbs. *I'd like to stay and have a go at the shielding charm, but I don't think I've much left in me.*

\'I\'m going to head back to Gryffindor Tower,\' he said.

Slytherin exploded into another string of parseltongue. Harry left him to it and headed back to the common room.

\'Where've you been?\' Hermione demanded. \'I looked in the library

and asked around, but nobody's seen you since you left after class.\'

Harry shrugged. \'It\'s easier to work out of sight where I won\'t be disturbed.\'

\'Did you finish the essay? I can look over it for you.\'

\'It\'s not quite done yet,\' he said. \'I want to check a couple of things, maybe squeeze in an extra bit to give Flitwick a good impression at the start of the year.\'

\'Good idea.\' Hermione beamed, then her face fell. \'Ron\'s upstairs with Seamus and Dean. Neville said he was fine, since you were *so* concerned earlier, but I think the Unforgivables really bother him. He's shut himself inside his bed hangings and isn't talking to anyone.\'

*Maybe he knows someone who got hit with one of them.*

*Someone other than me, that is.*

\'The Unforgivable Curses bother everyone except the worst kind of wizards, Hermione,' he said. 'What would you have to be to not be bothered by curses to control, torture and kill?\'

\'I think they bother Neville more than most.' Hermione's brown eyes bored into his. 'And I think you know that, even though it doesn't seem to bother you.'

'What am I meant to do?' Harry asked. 'I can't undo whatever it was that happened.'

Her lips thinned into a white line. 'No, but you should be upset that something like that happened to one of your friends.'

'Like how everyone's so upset it happened to me?' Harry raised an eyebrow at her. 'They *celebrate* my parents' deaths every year, Hermione. You all do.'

'That's---'

'Different? *How?'* He stepped past her and headed upstairs.

'Because you all got something good out of it it's all ok? The greater good?' Hermione flinched. 'No... but you're not Neville, you're *Harry.'*

He left her behind. *You don't know Harry. None of you do. Even*

*Neville had his grandmother before coming to Hogwarts. I only had myself.*

# The Butterfly Effect

Light, warm rain turned heavy and cold as October crept by; it drummed on the Forbidden Forest\'s canopy as it faded orange, brown, and red, pattering through autumn morning mist into the Black Lake.

*If it weren't so miserable, it'd still feel like September.* Harry dragged his gaze away from the window and back into the Great Hall.

'Still not going to enter, Harry?' Seamus asked.

'My desire for eternal glory died permanently at about age eleven.' He stretched up to pat the top of Hermione's research bundle. 'There's a really big pile of old newspapers that says yours probably isn't going to make it through the tournament.'

'Nah, mate. They'll definitely have made it more safe this time.

Dean's going to enter too, now.'

'Have you been at some other school the last few years?' Harry quipped. 'A troll, a cerberus, a werewolf, a baby dragon, *a basilisk*\...'

'And a vampire.' Ron poked his head up over a mountain of eggs and bacon. 'Can't forget Snape.'

Dean nodded. 'Worst of the lot. His potions class is probably the

final task.'

*You wouldn't be saying that if you'd seen the basilisk.*

\'The other schools are coming today,\' Seamus crowed. 'Nearly

time!'

Harry sighed and returned to *A Guide to Advanced*

*Transfiguration*, raising his book over Katie Bell\'s best attempts to spill

pumpkin juice over everything. He vanished the trail of juice edging toward his lap, then tucked his wand back up his sleeve.

Katie flushed. 'Thanks Harry.' 'No worries.'

She leant across. 'Why're you reading OWL books?'

'Someone challenged me to make my own spell.' Harry caught Hermione's eye as she looked up. 'Transfiguration. And supposedly, I've a bit of a gift that I've been wasting.'

'What sort of spell?'

He lowered his book. 'Something based on the Bird Conjuring Spell. Butterflies.'

'How girly of you.'

'Sporty tom-boy said what?'

Katie laughed. 'Can't dispute that.'

*Slytherin did.* Harry stifled a wince at the recollection of the portrait's apoplexy. *Even knowing a swarm of butterflies makes an almost impervious shield to the Killing Curse, Cruciatus Curse, or any dark curses that cause no physical damage, he was still upset it wasn't snakes.*

Hermione crossed her arms. 'Show us, then.' 'Please,' Katie muttered.

\'Papilionis.\' Harry drew a narrow vee in the air with the tip of his

wand.

his head.

A single, grey, rather lopsided butterfly lurched in a spiral around

*Not quite what I was hoping for. Not even the right colour.*

The tragic creature corkscrewed across the table, avoided Ron\'s

fork by a whisker, and collapsed in front of Hermione. She poked it with her wand and the butterfly burst into a wisp of black smoke.

Harry frowned and scratched his head. *Something isn't quite right.*

Hermione shot him a smug look.

Harry ignored her. *She's just mad because I won't tell her where I spend my time. And that I don't need her help all the time anymore.*

\'Papilionis.\' He forced more magic into the spell.

Two black butterflies darted across the table into Katie\'s face. She shrieked and batted them away.

*They were a little better formed.* Harry watched Katie set his conjurations alight. *The wings were the right shape and they were the right colour.*

'Only really special wizards make their own spells before they take their OWLs, Harry.' Hermione offered him a smile half between encouraging and satisfied. 'Even modifying them is meant to be really tricky.'

*Your half-sincere condescension is really starting to annoy me.*

Harry took a deep breath. *At least when the champions are chosen for this tournament Hermione can have her I told you so moment and stop being so pissy with everyone.*

\'Aren\'t Beauxbaton and Durmstrang\'s students meant to be arriving today,\' Alicia asked.

though.\'

'I think so,\' Angelina said. 'I don\'t know how they\'re arriving,

Startled exclamations burst from near the window. \'What's that?\' Dean peered past Harry's shoulder. \'It\'s a bird,\' someone said.

\'No, it\'s a plane,\' a student cried.

A few sniggers echoed round the hall and more than a few blank

looks rose from those raised in the magical world.

\'It\'s Beauxbatons\' flying carriage,\' a seventh year Ravenclaw announced in a very Hermione-ish manner. \'It\'s pulled by Abraxan horses.\'

The coach was a pale, pastel blue and covered in ornate gold decoration. Huge shining wheels spun in the wind. The entire affair, both winged horses and carriage, disappeared behind the central tower.

Harry returned to his book. *At least it means everyone will be talking about something slightly different.*

Professor Dumbledore and the majority of the Hogwarts staff strode down the hall, trailed by what appeared to be the remainder of the student body.

\'Something\'s happening to the lake,\' a first year squeaked. Half the students thundered from one side of the room to the

other.

\'It\'s bubbling,\' someone shouted. \'There\'s a ship!\'

\'It must be Durmstrang,\' the same seventh year Ravenclaw announced.

\'Do they know about the giant squid?\' a girl asked. Harry bit back a laugh. *That could be a nasty surprise.* \'I heard Durmstrang is in the Czech Republic,\' Ron said.

\'The Czech Republic is a land-locked country, Ron,\' Hermione replied. \'Travelling by ship would be very impractical.\'

\'Me mam said something about Scandinavia,\' Seamus said.

\'If everyone could find a seat on their house tables.\' Dumbledore held his wand against his throat to magnify his voice over the hubbub. \'Let\'s give a good impression to our guests, shall we?\'

Everyone scrambled back to the tables and Harry found himself squished between Katie and a sixth year boy. Harry tucked his elbows in as far as possible and tried not to think about the warmth of the two of them, but each time he made some space to breathe, they seemed to seep into it.

*It's not going to be for long.* He took several deep breaths and pictured the circle of dark ink on white parchment, letting himself sink into the blackness of it. *They're just close to you. They won't bite.*

Katie craned her neck round Harry, stretching so far she was all but lying over his lap. He leant as far back as he could without falling off the bench.

She giggled. \'Sorry, Harry. Didn\'t mean to be so forward.\'

He dragged as much of a smile as he could manage onto his face.

Katie's brow creased. Harry plastered a new smile on top of the first. A bright, easy, spread of teeth that welled up from the back of his mind like water from a spring.

Her cheeks blossomed pink. 'At least it's the sporty tom-boy lying all over you. If I were Lavender, you'd smell like apple blossom or something equally girly for the rest of the day.'

'I suppose it could be worse.'

'It made you smile.' She squirmed. 'It's a nice smile. Never seen you smile like that before.'

*Because it's not my smile.* A cold fist closed round Harry's spine and the expression slipped off his lips. The rest of the face he'd half- recalled it from seeped from his memory. High cheekbones, smooth, combed hair, and mahogany eyes with just a hint of hunger. *It's Riddle's smile. Bloody hell.*

The Durmstrang students strode into the Great Hall draped in fur- cloaks and with knee-high leather boots. Their headmaster, a silver-haired, sour-faced man with a short, pointed goatee came last, his arm draped about the broad shoulders of his final student.

\'That\'s Viktor Krum,\' Ron hissed.

A murmur ripped through the hall. The Bulgarian seeker's eyes

remained fixed on Professor Dumbledore.

\'Igor.\' Professor Dumbledore spread his arms

'Dumbledore.' Durmstrang's headmaster responded with a sharp, curt nod. 'Madame Maxime is on her way. She stopped to give more precise instructions to your gamekeeper about her Abraxans.\'

Professor Dumbledore let his arms drop as the Durmstrang students followed Krum to the Slytherin table.

Whispers filled the hall.

Harry returned to the pages of his transfiguration book. *Maybe the reason it's not working is something to do with the fact I'm conjuring out of nothing instead of using an elemental medium like I did for the basilisk.*

Silence descended over the Great Hall.

'That girl is *not* normal,\' Katie muttered.

A group of French witches strolled past glass-eyed Hogwarts students. Harry caught a glimpse of platinum hair at the very end of the Ravenclaw table as the witches found some space. A two person gap opened around the silver-haired witch and she stared up at the ceiling as if nothing below it interested her in the slightest.

A large bowl of fish stew appeared on the table.

Harry jerked his book up just in time to avoid decorating its spine with the largest prawns he'd ever seen. *They look quite tasty, actually.* He tried to free his arms, but Katie and the sixth year boy had monopolised all the space. *I guess I'll wait, then.*

Harry turned the page and tuned out the clatter of cutlery, plates, and goblets rose up around him. Katie chattered away about quidditch on his right with Angelina and Alicia. He poked her goblet of pumpkin juice out of harm's way with the corner of his book.

The table turned quiet and still.

\'Do you still want the bouillabaisse?\' A soft French-accented voice drifted over his shoulder.

Harry caught a flash of platinum hair out the corner of his eye.

*Presumably Bouillabaisse is the thing with the giant prawns.*

\'All yours.\' He leant out the way of Katie, who'd two hands on the

dish.

She swung the bowl past Harry\'s nose and into a pair of small, fair-skinned hands.

'Bizarre,' the soft voice murmured. \'Merci.' Quiet footsteps padded

away.

Harry glanced up and met Katie\'s stare. \'What?\'

\'You\'re not acting like all those idiots.\' She gestured at the pair of

fifth boys across from them who were staring after the French girl.

Harry blinked. 'Am I meant to be?'

Katie beamed. 'It's a good thing, don't worry.'

'If you say so.\' He drew and raised his wand. 'Papilionis.'

A swarm of imperfect butterflies erupted from his wand tip and scattered across the table. Alicia shrieked and Ron hunched over his lunch like a vulture over a carcass.

\'Sorry.\' Harry banished them into black smoke. \'I wasn\'t expecting so many.\'

\'No more insects,\' Katie growled.

'Fair enough.'

*I'll have to ask Slytherin why it's not working.* He grimaced.

*Another argument about butterflies beckons.*

\'Now our guests have arrived, it is time we come to the main attraction of the year.\' Professor Dumbledore approached the lectern at the head of the hall and the food vanished. \'It is time for the Triwizard Tournament to begin. However, first we must cover some of the rules.\'

An ancient, rough-hewn goblet appeared at the dais\' edge. Blue flames danced above the cup and an eldritch glow bled from it into the air.

The whole hall stared.

Harry watched the azure fire flicker in Ron's eyes.

\'First of all, it should be made very clear that nobody below the age of seventeen is allowed to enter.\' Professor Dumbledore paused as a loud groan rippled round the hall. 'To ensure no *mishaps* occur, I have taken the liberty of drawing an age line around the goblet. Aside from that, the tournament will proceed as it did before it was cancelled. Anyone wishing to be chosen as champion may enter their name into the goblet over the next two days and the names of the champions will be announced by it soon afterward.\'

The entire table scrambled for parchment, ink, and quills as if the first few to enter might have some advantage. Ron launched himself into an expletive-punctuated tirade Mrs Weasley herself would\'ve been proud of.

*So loud.* Harry pulled his book back out of the way. *It might be best if I went to the chamber*.

Slytherin's portrait stared up at Harry from where he\'d leant it against one of the columns as Harry explained his problem. \'They\'re such feminine insects. Can\'t you use dragonflies, or bats, or anything more respectable?\'

\'Butterflies are simple and their wings cover a lot of area,\' Harry

said. 'Now are you going to help or sulk?\'

The portrait crossed its arms. \'Salazar Slytherin does *not* sulk.\'

*Of course he doesn\'t.*

\'What are you visualising?\' Salazar asked.

\'Butterflies, swirling around me in a sort of demi-sphere.\' \'How are you picturing them forming?\'

\'I wasn\'t really,\' Harry replied. \'It never mattered for the bird- conjuring spell.\'

\'But I\'d wager you only ever conjured one bird. A single bird you can probably get away with, but for lots, you have to focus on them being created from the air beforehand. It\'s harder to conjure from such an insubstantial thing.\'

Harry imagined the butterflies curling together as if from smoke.

'Papilionis.'

A cloud of wings and legs engulfed him, tickling every inch of skin. \'That\'s pretty good,\' Salazar said. \'Practice directing them as a

shield and you could use them to deflect some types of curses as you

wanted, or even transfigure them and use them as weapons.\'

*Transfiguring them sounds like a good idea.*

\'You\'ve spent a lot of time down here over the last month.' Salazar's brows drew together. \'And that\'s *excluding* the use of the time- turner.\'

\'My friends are all obsessed with the Triwizard Tournament.\' Harry shrugged. \'I don\'t particularly enjoy talking about it constantly and I *do* need to get much better for the next time something goes wrong.\'

\'Don\'t forget your friends. You\'ll need them, especially with your record of ending up entangled in anything remotely dangerous.\'

\'I haven\'t forgotten them, but it\'s hard to be with them for all my free time when most of them don\'t do anything I find interesting. The only one who does share interests resents having any real competition.\'

\'Choose better friends, then,\' Salazar said.

\'There are no better friends.'

Salazar shrugged, bouncing his snake on his shoulders. It let out an irritated hiss. \'If you say so,\' he said

\'I do.'

*Who would be better? Malfoy? Zacharias Smith?*

\'Papilionis.\' Harry conjured a cloud of black butterflies, directing the swarm to swirl around him fast enough he could see through the blur of wings. He transfigured one of the butterflies into a gleaming, steel spike and with a flick of his wand, sent it flying out of the shield.

It hissed across the chamber and thunked into the stone wall a few inches above the Slytherin\'s picture.

\'Be careful,\' Salazar exploded. \'I do *not* need one of those impaled through my canvas. Sometimes you\'re worse than Godric!\'

Harry attempted it several more times using sponge balls.

Eventually, he got the hang of directing his projectiles where he wanted them.

\'My Chamber of Secrets looks like a childrens\' playground,\' Salazar griped.

Harry gave the giant corpse of the basilisk a pointed look. 'I suspect it wouldn't meet health and safety requirements.' He vanished the mess he had made.

\'It\'s a surprisingly useful spell,\' Salazar said. \'Despite the ridiculous butterflies.\'

*Hermione would huff if she saw it was working already.* Harry heaved the portrait back over the bridge and replaced it above the entrance, slipped the time-turner onto its hook on the desk.

\'Godric used to steal that and move my things around,\' Salazar murmured. \'He thought it was hilarious, until Rowena found out and yelled at him for messing with time over something so petty.\'

\'You miss them.'

\'I\'d miss anyone after half a millennium with no company but a mad serpent and a delusional child. Even Godric\'s childish japes, Helga\'s mothering, or Rowena\'s lectures.\' Slytherin stared into the floor. \'I think when you've redeemed the title of Heir of Slytherin and no longer need my advice, I\'d quite like to be moved somewhere else in the castle. Maybe you\'ll find a portrait of my old friends in the Room of Requirement.\'

\'I\'ll search for it,\' Harry promised.

\'You should go back to your tower and see your friends. Heir of Slytherin or not, you\'ll need them.\'

Harry nodded and headed back up the stairs.

A cluster of fourth years slumped in the sofas round the fire.

\'It\'s rather empty in here.' Harry crossed to join them. 'Where's everyone else?'

Ron\'s face twisted into a scowl. 'Still by the goblet in the hall. The younger years are in lessons.'

\'Not happy about the age rules, I take it.\'

\'Bloody pissed off is more like it.'

Hermione tutted.

\'Don\'t take it too hard,\' Harry said.

\'It was my *chance*, Harry.\' Ron sighed. \'You wouldn\'t understand, you\'ve always been noticed and famous and had everything. I was going to be noticed, too. I wouldn\'t just be another Weasley, or Harry Potter\'s friend, or something like that. I don\'t want the whole limelight or anything, just a glimmer for myself.\'

*It's not worth wishing for.* Harry buried a flicker of distaste. *And*

*even if it was, wishes are made, they don't happen just because you hope.*

\'Honestly, Ron, I\'d happily give you the entire thing.\'

\'It\'s easy to say that from where you\'re standing, mate,\' Dean said. \'I\'m just another muggle-born student that half the wizarding world doesn\'t think should be here. You\'ve been a hero from birth.\'

\'I didn\'t want to be.\'

\'We know. You never go chasing things like this or even use your fame at all,\' Seamus replied. \'It\'s just a little annoying to be in your shadow sometimes.\'

\'Well we\'ll be in the shadow of the Hogwarts champion together,\' Harry said. \'I\'ve no desire to enter my name and I couldn\'t anyway.\'

\'Fred and George tried to cheat past the age line earlier,\' Hermione announced. \'It didn\'t work, but I\'ve seen loads of younger students trying everything they can to get in.\'

Dean scoffed. \'I\'d take my hat off to anyone who manages to slip past an age line created by Dumbledore.\'

*I've no idea how the ward works, but I doubt anyone's going to*

*get past it.*

'Maybe next time,\' Harry said. 'You\'d have a better shot at winning

then.\'

said.

\'It was held every five years back when it was running,\' Seamus

'This was our only shot,' Dean added.

\'I\'m going upstairs.\' Ron shoved himself out of his chair and

slouched off.

Seamus and Dean shared a glance and trailed after him. \'Did you try and put your name in?\' Hermione asked. \'No,\' Harry said. \'I\'ve been trying to perfect my butterfly

summoning spell.\'

\'That\'s really advanced transfiguration, Harry.\' Hermione patted him on the arm. \'You shouldn\'t be trying it for another year at least, really. I'm only starting to read about it now and probably won't be able to do it until Christmas or the Spring. I\'m really impressed you managed to conjure anything at all.\'

Harry tried to muster a smile, managing to borrow Riddle\'s bright, insincere cheer. \'Thanks, Hermione.\'

# The Flower of the Heart

High, refined cheekbones, slender, elegant brows, bright, clear, blue eyes and full lips framed by flowing, silver hair stared out of the mirror.

*Perfect.* Fleur pushed the small mirror over with the tip of her finger. *As always.*

Madame Maxime's silhouette loomed on the other side of the Venetian blind. Fleur pushed it up and saw her caught in conversation with Hogwarts\' gamekeeper. Fleur recognised the look on the huge man\'s face all too well.

Fleur let the blind fall and slipped out of her room. She drew her magic into herself as far as she could. *Madame Maxime will be furious if I get caught by a bunch of boys.* Fleur scowled and stepped down into the long grass. *And it will validate the rumours those harpies like to spread.*

A chill soaked into her shoes and cloak. Fine, cold mist hovered in the air, coating her in water droplets.

'Merde.' Fleur shivered and stared up at Hogwarts' grey battlements. 'Does this awful place *never* see any sun?'

*I suppose they need the walls to be so thick and ugly just to keep out the cold and the rain.*

She strode into the Great Hall. A dusk sky twinkled over her head and a faint white circle of magic glowed around the goblet's stand. Its rippling blue flames threw faint shadows across the flagstones. Fleur put one foot through the age line.

It flared bright as a full moon, then settled back to a dull glow.

She stepped all the way through and fished a piece of parchment from her pocket.

*Fleur Delacour.* She read the parchment\'s slanting, delicate script read in the blue light of the goblet, then dropped it into the flames. They turned red, then faded back to azure. *Accepted. As always.*

She spun on her heel.

A shadow passed the entrance of the hall.

'Merde,' Fleur whispered.

*If it's Madame Maxime, I'm in trouble.*

A dark, messy-haired Hogwarts student made his way along the wall to her right.

*Gabrielle's age, but he'll probably be half-handsome when he's older.* Fleur wrinkled her nose at his round glasses. *If an English boy can learn some style, that is.*

The boy followed the edge of the wall, his head cocked. The goblet's flames illuminated his face as he drew neat, flashing off his glasses. She glimpsed a pair of sharp, emerald eyes.

*Merde. He saw me.* Fleur held her breath. *Now he'll come bother*

*me.*

One of his eyebrows quirked and he carried on.

*That's the same boy that ignored me before. Interesting.* She

allowed her magic free, letting her allure swell to its usual level and stomping her foot. *Now we'll see if he notices me.*

The young wizard paused a few steps from the end of the hall and shot her a second glance. \'Tempus.\' Silver numbers ghosted from the end of his wand, then he vanished into the corridors beyond the hall.

*Good thing none of the other girls saw that.* Fleur pursed her lips.

*I wonder if he'd be able to resist my magic if I actually try?*

She stole back out into the drizzle and down the uneven, steep, slippery steps.

\'Where've you been, Fleur?\' Caroline\'s chubby face stretched into a sickly smile as the small, round girl skulked from the shadows at the end of the corridor.

'Yeah, *Fleur*.' Emilie's gangly figure crept out from behind Caroline. \'Been sneaking up to Hogwarts to bewitch little boys again, have you?\'

\'I don\'t *bewitch* anyone,\' Fleur said. \'If you\'re both still upset that your boyfriends are so weak-minded they cannot resist my magic then take it up with them, or, better still, ask yourselves why they might be looking at other girls when they have *you*.\'

*We're not best friends anymore. You ran off chasing boys and left me behind.* Fleur hid a small smile. *And now your boys leave you to chase me. Fair's fair.*

\'Our boyfriends were fine until you used your veela magic to enchant them and lure them away,\' Emilie hissed. \'At least we know those rumours about you really are true. Why else would you be sneaking out in the middle of the night?\'

\'It\'s barely early evening,\' Fleur snapped. \'Your ability to tell the time is as poor as your duelling, Emilie. Would you like me to remind you which of us is the school duelling champion?\'

'Madame would bar you from competing.' Caroline sniffed. \'You

wouldn\'t *dare*.\'

\'It doesn\'t matter,\' Emilie sang. \'She\'s probably too tired to do anything after her *excursion.* How many was it, Fleur? Did you lure enough in to satiate yourself?\'

'Bold words from the needy little girl who threw herself at any boy she could see. The whole school knows you lost your virginity to a middle-aged janitor in a bathroom stall. No wonder you can't keep a boyfriend long enough to stop you coming back to irritate me.'

Emilie balled her fists. '*You* started that rumour and pinned what

*you* were doing on *me*.'

'Even Caroline doesn't believe that,' Fleur said. 'And she's gullible enough to believe every time a boy says *I love you* before he starts trying to take off her clothes.'

'Oh no, you're not turning this one around,\' Caroline crowed. 'Madame Maxime *forbade* us from going out after curfew.

'I hope you got enough to keep you sated for a while, because she's not going to let you slip out again.' Emilie's lip curled. 'Or maybe the other rumours are true? Maybe for all her unnatural charm, poor little Fleur's never been so much as kissed.\'

\'As if I care what you or your rumours say.' Fleur stuck her nose in the air and stared at a point just over Caroline's head. \'You're both just *less* than me. Less attractive. Less powerful. Less important. Go ahead and try to satisfy your empty lives by whispering about me, it won't redeem you and it won't *work*.\'

Caroline gasped. Emilie reached for her wand.

Fleur caught her wrist. \'Why would you even try? Charms, duelling, enchanting... I'm better than you at every aspect of magic. We're not children anymore, Emilie. You can\'t flaunt your first boyfriends and early kisses in my face and expect me to care. Go back to your room and take Caroline with you before I decide to *actually* take someone you care about away.\'

They scurried away like frightened mice.

Fleur caught sight of her reflection in the window. *Merde. Not so perfect now.* She took several deep breaths and watched her reflection's eyes shrink, shifting from black to light blue. Feathers slid back into her skin all down her spine. *I shouldn't let those two get to me. I wasted enough tears on them years ago. Now, I've left them behind.*

'I should write to Gabby and make sure she's okay,' Fleur murmured as she slipped back into her room. 'She will be lonely now I've left and I promised I'd write, but I'll need to borrow a school owl, if I can.'

# I am Number Four

Storm clouds brewed on the ceiling of the Great Hall. Lightning flashed above Harry's corner of Gryffindor Table; its thunder rippled out across the whole hall like waves across a dark sea.

He propped his book up between Ron and his rack of toast, munching bites between turning the pages. *It's going to be a good day.*

The Goblet of Fire burnt with good cheer at the far end of the hall.

The blue flames flickered in the corner of Harry's eye, reflecting on the inside of his glasses.

\'Ten sickles says it\'s Angelina,\' Seamus muttered.

Dean spared Hermione a wary look. \'You\'re on. It'll be Diggory or

that uppity Ravenclaw for sure.\'

Ron swallowed a huge mouthful of bacon. \'He won\'t pay you.

Seamus still owes me for the house-elf bet.\'

\'Don\'t remind me.' Dean shuddered. \'And keep it down, Hermione\'s not remembered to try foist badges onto us today yet. Let\'s try and make it last?\'

Harry looked up from his book. 'Badges?'

\'Yeah.\' Seamus glowered. \'It\'s *your* damn fault. That rubbish you fed her about house-elves at Hogwarts set her off in search of the kitchens and now she\'s gone and started an enslaved magical people\'s rights group.\'

\'I just wanted to stop her attempts to force feed me.\'

\'Well it worked, but we\'re all paying a high price for it,\' Dean said.

Harry shrugged. 'She hasn\'t tried to sell me one.\'

\'You haven\'t exactly been around, mate,\' Ron groused. \'We\'re living dangerously, we are.\'

\'Yeah, any more refusals and she\'ll realise we don\'t agree with her,\' Dean said.

Seamus grinned. \'Or worse, we might end up like Neville.\' Harry raised an eyebrow.

\'Hermione\'s sold him about ten badges already, but he keeps forgetting them. She thinks he\'s doing it on purpose and has taken to harassing him about wearing them every time she sees him.\'

\'Better him than us,\' Dean said. \'Better him than us.\'

\'Too true.\' Ron glanced down the table to where Hermione's bushy hair stuck out of her textbook. \'She went mental on Lavender when she refused to wear one because it didn\'t go with her lip gloss.\'

Seamus laughed. \'Best refusal yet. Hermione was absolutely livid that lip gloss could be considered of equal importance to her anti-slavery movement.\'

\'Someone needs to tell her about the differences between keeping house-elves and having slaves,\' Ron grumbled. \'It\'s growing well beyond a joke.\'

They all turned to look at Harry.

\'I don\'t actually know myself,' he said. 'Have you tried leaving books about it lying around near her? She\'ll see them, read them, then maybe stop. Once she\'s learnt a bit more, she\'ll realise she\'s wrong and move on. Hermione hates being wrong, she'll give it up.\'

\'That\'s a good idea, mate,\' Seamus said. \'Cunning. Worth the trip to the library too.\'

Ron threw a long look at the goblet. \'Do you reckon they\'ll announce the champions today?\'

\'Dumbledore said he would,\' Dean replied.

Harry buried his nose in Salazar's crumbling, ancient charms book, flicking through pages of illegible, smeared text until he found a readable section. *The water conjuring charm. Probably useful.*

He pinched Ron\'s goblet and pointed his wand tip into it.

'Aguamenti.'

A dribble of water trickled into the bottom of the goblet.

*Simple enough. Just needs practice.* Harry turned the next clump of bile-plastered pages until he found another legible paragraph. *The shield charm is a heavily intent based ward, adapted from basic hex deflection into a more practical defence. As such it can only be penetrated by spells cast with stronger intent and focus. The ultimate example of which is the Killing Curse that has such a potent level of intent it cannot be shielded against.*

'A shame there's not much of this book left.' He squinted at the

tattered cover, but found no sign of either title or author. 'It's quite good.'

He pored over the few legible pages, munching on toast, and practising the wand motions for the stunning spell.

A strange prickle crawled down the nape of his neck and along his

spine.

Harry focused on the book, but the sensation persisted. He glanced up.

Every pair of eyes in the Great Hall stared back.

The bottom dropped out of his stomach. *I missed something important.* His heart sank. *Which usually means something has gone unexpectedly, horribly wrong.*

\'Good book, Harry?\' Professor Dumbledore called from beside the

goblet.

He nodded and a titter of laughter rippled round the room. Harry\'s gut knotted itself into a tangle. *What the hell is*

*happening?*

Professor Dumbledore gestured toward the small door at the end of the hall. \'Would you mind joining the others, Harry?\'

*I suppose it can't be worse than being stared at in here.* Harry rose from his seat.

His friends' faces stared up all along the table, twisted into grimaces and scowls. Pinched lips, dark glares, and muttered insults followed him down the hall. Professor Dumbledore crumpled a burnt- edged piece of parchment in his fingers.

*Oh.* Harry froze mid-step, his blood turning to ice. *Oh, this is not seriously happening, is it?* He turned Professor Dumbledore, but the headmaster\'s stern expression stopped him in his tracks. *I didn\'t even want to watch the tournament, let alone take part in the bloody thing.*

Harry fixed the goblet with a cold glare and stalked into the antechamber. Cedric Diggory and a silver-haired French girl leant against the wall within. Victor Krum paced the floor like a caged tiger.

\'What is it, Harry?\' Diggory asked. \'Do they want us to go back?\'

Harry blinked. *What the hell am I here for if he\'s the champion?*

He managed a hint of a smile. *Seamus owes Dean ten sickles.*

\'This is unprecedented,\' a loud voice boomed. Ludo Bagman stomped into the room. \'A *fourth* champion.\'

*\'He* is going to compete?\' The silver-haired girl turned her nose

up. '*Vraiment*?'

\'He has to.\' Mr Crouch\'s dry, tired voice echoed from the corner of the room. \'Entering your name in the goblet represents the creation of a magically binding contract.\'

*Of course it does.* Harry clenched his jaw and seethed. *Every year.*

*Every single year. There's always something. I shouldn\'t even be surprised.*

He sighed. \'What if you didn\'t put your name in and happened to find yourself here anyway?\'

\'Are you suggesting that you did not enter your name, Mr Potter?\' Professor Dumbledore swept into the centre of the room, trailed by Professor McGonagall, Professor Moody, and Snape.

\'I wasn\'t suggesting it, sir. I can say with complete certainty that I didn\'t consciously do so, nor did I get another student to do it.\'

\'He\'s lying,\' the French girl said, tossing her hair over her shoulder. \'How *else* did his name come out?\'

\'It does seem unlikely, Harry,\' Professor Dumbledore said.

Harry shrugged. *Whatever, then. I'm stuck in the bloody thing*

*either way.*

\'We would like an extra champion,\' Beauxbatons' enormous headmistress demanded. \'Hogwarts cannot have two when we only have one.\'

\'Hogwarts has only one champion,\' Harry said. \'Diggory put his

name in and was chosen. He's the representative of the school.\'

Diggory frowned.

\'You *have* to compete,\' Mr Crouch said. 'Else you'll likely lose your

magic.\'

\'I know.\' Harry scowled. \'I don\'t have to belong to a school,

though. I\'ll turn up and take part, but I won\'t be earning any extra points for Hogwarts when I never even wanted to compete in the first place.\'

\'If that is what you wish, Harry.\' The twinkle faded from Professor

Dumbledore's eyes.

Ice tightened around Harry's heart. *It's your fault, you old coot! Your age line was meant to stop stuff like this. But just like last year and both years before, I'm the one who gets stuck in the middle of all your mess!*

\'Is that acceptable?\' Mr Crouch asked the other champions.

\'It\'s not like he will earn any points anyway,\' the French witch said. Krum and Cedric nodded.

\'Then it\'s settled,\' Bagman cried. \'We\'ll come and fetch you before the wand-weighing ceremony at the start of the tournament.\'

The other champions filed out past Harry, Beauxbatons' champion

glaring at him through her veil of silver hair.

*I don\'t think she likes me.*

\'Stay here please, Harry,\' Professor Dumbledore said.

Professor McGonagall thrust the door shut. Snape sneered.

Professor Moody's magical eye fixed itself on a point right between Harry's

ears.

\'I didn\'t expect this from you, my boy.\' Professor Dumbledore shook his head. \'I won\'t pretend to understand why you entered, but you have to take part now and you\'re at a great disadvantage. The tasks were designed for sixth and seventh year students, not fourth years.\'

\'I didn\'t enter my name.'

\'I see,\' Professor Dumbledore murmured.

*Ridiculous.* Harry choked down a cold ball or fury. *What do I have to do for people to trust me? Kill two basilisks? Whoever put my name in this stupid tournament is going to regret it.*

He turned and wrenched the door open, stalking round the corner toward the common room. Whispers and barbed comments dogged his footsteps.

*At least my friends will believe me once I tell them.*

Stark silence fell over the Gryffindor Common Room.

\'I can\'t believe you, Harry.\' Ron launched himself out of his seat. \'You said you *wouldn\'t* put your name in! You *promised* you\'d be watching alongside us!\'

Hot, angry eyes stared from all parts of the room.

\'You could've at least told us how you managed it so we\'d have a chance as well,\' Seamus spat. \'Your word doesn\'t mean much does it?\'

They turned their backs when he opened his mouth to speak.

Hermione looked away and folded her arms.

The little point of ice in Harry's chest tightened like a vice. *Why won\'t they listen?*

He turned to the trio of chasers. \'You girls believe me, right?\' \'You told us you weren\'t going to enter,\' Angelina snapped. \'But

your name came out, didn\'t it?\'

Harry searched a sea of cold faces. *So that\'s how it is.* He tightened his hands into fists. *So much for house loyalty.* He spun and stormed toward the Chamber of Secrets before any of the words slipped up from the ball of cold fury in his chest to his tongue. *Salazar was right. I should've made better friends.*

He marched past Myrtle\'s cubicle and down the stairs, tore his wand from his sleeve, and unleashed every violent spell he knew. Red, purple, and white magic hissed through the air. Serpent effigies shattered, throwing dust and sharp stone fragments across the chamber. A sharp piece of stone sliced a line of fire through his cheek and a hot drop trickled down his chin and neck.

*Why?* He hurled magic into the basilisk's impenetrable hide. *Why?*

*Why? Why?* Harry slumped down against the wall and pounded his fist into the stone chips and dust until the pain swallowed his rage. *Why do I never get to keep things?*

'Stupid, bloody idiots.' He picked bits of stone out of his hand and tossed them away, smearing blood down his robes. The small point of ice in his chest melted into a numb, hollow void. 'They should know better.

When have I *ever* wished to be in something like this?'

Harry repaired the damage he'd done to the walls, vanished the

blood off his robes, and crossed into the study. \'What were you doing?\' Salazar asked him.

\'Venting.'

Salazar's brows drew together. \'What happened?\'

\'My name was chosen for the Triwizard Tournament. I didn\'t even enter, but nobody will listen to me, let alone believe me. My housemates and friends certainly don\'t.'

\'I do,\' Salazar said.

\'What does it say about my friends that the only one who trusts me is a thousand year old portrait?\' Harry demanded.

\'It says Godric and Helga would both be very disappointed. Tell me about the tournament.\'

\'It has tasks. Three of them. There's a champion from each of

Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons, then me.\' \'Is it dangerous?\'

\'It was cancelled because the contestants kept dying.\' \'Something worth winning, then,\' Salazar said.

\'I\'m competing with much older students; the best in their

schools.\'

\'You\'re my heir. You\'re a prodigy at transfiguration, proficient at

duelling, and you\'re powerful in your own right. You can win. You *will* win.\'

\'Why would I even *want* to win?\' Harry asked. 'It's a stupid bloody idea. Let's stick a bunch of children in a death-trap and watch what happens. Sounds like great fucking fun.'

\'The hat nearly put you in Slytherin, yes?\'

\'Yes.\'

\'Then use some of that ambition you must have lurking inside you and prove yourself better. Silence your doubters and former friends by winning the damn thing.' Salazar's lip curled. 'They\'ll come flocking back to you afterward, I guarantee it.\'

\'What if I don\'t want them back?\'

\'Make better allies, then.\' Salazar's wand let out a spurt of green and silver sparks. \'You wanted to be stronger. Accomplish it. Winning this tournament will prove you really have bettered yourself.\'

*I need to be better.* Harry swallowed a stab of yearning. *I've watched too many wishes slip through my fingers. How many can there be left now?*

\'What should I do?\' he asked. \'How can I win?\'

\'Cunning. They'll underestimate you and focus on the other champions. Ignore your pride and use theirs against them. A serpent strikes from hiding.\' Salazar stroked the snake looped round his shoulders. \'Do the rituals. The first is more of a risk if you carry it out before adulthood, but its benefits will be greater because of it. The second is virtually risk free. It will encourage your body to improve itself more quickly, though that's a very simplistic explanation. Neither will bring you incredible power, but they'll help close the gap between you and the others. Tom Riddle profited greatly from these, though he took them many steps further afterward on his own.\'

Harry scowled at the painting. *And look what happened to Tom Riddle. More monster than man.*

\'Intent is the most important part of magic,\' Salazar said. 'There's no such thing as light or dark, only the intent with which power is wielded. You might not like it, but Albus Dumbledore is not famous and admired

because he's well-intentioned. He's famous and admired because he

intended to do great things and was *powerful enough to accomplish them.*'

*Damn right I don't like it!* Harry clenched his jaw and struggled for a retort. *But he's right. Professor Dumbledore could probably do anything Riddle's done, he just chooses not to.*

He took a deep breath. \'Fine. I\'ll do it.'

Salazar nodded. 'A man who's not afraid to open his mind to things he doesn't like will always go further than one who covers his ears and refuses to listen.'

Faint footprints marked the ladder up to where Salazar said the books about rituals were. The feet were too large to be Ginny\'s, about the same size as Harry\'s own.

Harry scuffed the marks away with his feet.

\'First two in the book,\' Salazar said. \'They\'re not very complex, just dangerous if you do something wrong.\'

Harry dropped two battered books down atop a dust-covered copy of *Secrets of the Darkest Arts* and clambered down the ladder.

Sheafs of parchment stuck out of the pages of the large, black tome.

*Tom Riddle\'s homework, no doubt*.

He picked up his books and turned to the painting. \'Am I likely to do anything wrong?\'

\'Not with me here. Now take me out into the chamber. You\'re not drawing runes all over my tidy study.\'

Harry sighed. *I hate carrying this painting*. *Whoever cast the anti- levitating charm on it was a sadist of the highest order. It was probably Salazar himself.*

'Use the flagrate spell.' Salazar sketched runes of green and silver fire in the air from the tip of his wand. 'Like that. It's best to have nothing but your own magic involved in the ritual.'

Harry tapped the tip of his wand on his palm and peered at the green flames in the cracked paint. *Flagrate's just conjured fire. I wonder if I can change the colour.*

He pictured purple flames and flicked his wand through the air.

Indigo fire traced after it. Harry grinned.

'What was wrong with green?' Salazar crossed his arms. 'Green is

the *best* colour.'

'I prefer purple.' Harry etched the runes from the book onto the floor until he crouched within a seven-pointed star and triangle of violet runes.

'No.' Salazar jabbed his wand at the last runes. 'Do that bit again.' He cocked his head. 'In fact, the first part and the runes by your left foot need to be more like the book, too.'

Harry glanced between them. *They could not be more identical.*

He did them again. *Whatever. Just in case.*

\'A few drops of blood at each of the points of the star and triangle,' Salazar said. 'If you were some half-rate wizard instead of my descendant, we'd have to be careful and do these separately, or even use a triangle instead of the star.'

Harry drew his wand tip across his palm, splitting the skin, and a thin line of red welled up and tricked into his cupped palm. He let a few drops fall onto each of the points. \'What happens now?\'

\'You stand exactly at the centre.\' Salazar pointed his wand at the middle of the star, his snake mimicking the motion with its tail. \'Then you

channel a little magic. The ritual will help you reach your magic more easily when you cast, as well as increasing your power by a small fraction.\'

Harry folded his arms.

Salazar sighed. \'Fine. I\'ll embellish. Think of your magic as a bubble. When you're born, you've got a tiny bubble, but, like all magical creatures, you have the ability to absorb magic and then use magic in some fashion. As you grow toward maturity, the bubble gets bigger, taking in magic from the world. You can force the bubble to get bigger by straining it in your formative years, but this is risky as too much strain and stress can warp how you use magic and even rob you of your control all together.

This ritual, to use a limited metaphor that doesn\'t require a lot of study to understand, changes the consistency of the bubble a fraction. You will draw magic in or out more easily, which makes casting spells more efficient, reduces the risks of strain, and lets you grow a little more powerful as a bonus.\'

\'And if something goes wrong?\'

\'Your runes are perfect, so unless you're interrupted, nothing will

happen.\'

\'Humour me?\'

\'Your bubble changes too much and does something very

interesting. It's a virtually non-existent possibility. I've checked your runes.\'

\'And the other ritual? Any nasty surprises there?\'

\'If you drew the triangle incorrectly or unevenly the effects might only be limited to certain parts of your body or certain aspects of improvement. You could simply redo it to correct things.\'

Harry fingered his glasses. \'Will it fix my eyesight?\'

\'No.\' Salazar shook his head. \'It pushes your body to make the best use of what it's given, but it won\'t affect any pre-existing problems with the template of your anatomy. It'll likely only give you the body of an athletic fourteen year old and perhaps speed up puberty.\'

*That's a shame*. *They're always falling off or misting up. It's frankly a miracle it hasn't happened at a more inconvenient moment, like in the presence of something highly dangerous.*

Harry frowned. \'I don\'t have to be naked, do I? It's chilly down here. I think we're right under the lake.\'

The snake buried its head in Salazar's robes.

\'Only a very precise and advanced ritual would be affected by clothing like yours. Fortunately for both of us, these two are neither. You should probably leave your wand outside, though, just in case.\'

Harry placed his holly and phoenix feather wand outside the edge

of the runic star. \'I suppose I'd best get started.'

*I won\'t turn back.* He watched the glyphs begin to glow and drew himself up. *I won\'t even look back.*

# Ostracised

Cold, hard stone pressed into Harry's cheek and the faint, metallic tang of blood hovered on his parched tongue. A dull, slow beat throbbed somewhere near the centre of his skull. Patches of blurred colour swam before his eyes.

*My glasses.* He squinted around.

The round-framed lenses lay a few feet from his nose. He pushed them back onto his face and struggled upright.

Salazar snoozed in his frame. The stone floor of the chamber bore faint purple scorch marks where Harry\'s blood had spattered the points of his ritual star and triangle, faded indigo lines lingering where the runes had been.

Harry cradled his throbbing head and watched the violet marks vanish. He scraped his parched tongue round the inside of his mouth and groaned. *I really need a drink*.

He staggered past the snoring Salazar and retrieved his wand, his head gushing with images of clear, cool water flowing, pouring and swirling. 'Aguamenti.\'

A spray of water reflected off his cupped hand like tap water off the inside of a spoon and soaked his chest.

*Wonderful.* He scowled at the chill creeping down his front. *Now I have to go back to Gryffindor Tower and change.*

Salazar's snores rumbled to a stop. \'Oh look. You survived.\' \'I feel utterly awful.\'

\'Why are you wet? The ritual has nothing to do with water.\'

\'I wanted a drink.\' Harry stuck his wand in his sleeve and dried his other hand on a dry patch of his robes.

\'Your magic came out more easily than you expected, then. Good thing the first spell you tried was quite a harmless one.\'

\'I\'ve got to go and change.'

Take me back into the study first. I\'ve spent more than enough time near that basilisk already.\'

\'Fine.\' Harry heaved the portrait onto his shoulders. \'You should really make better use of her,\' Slytherin.

Harry hefted the painting back up onto the wall. \'Of who?\'

\'My basilisk, of course.\' Salazar gave him a pitying look. \'There\'s all sorts of useful stuff on that serpent.\'

\'Like what?\' Harry glanced back through the door. 'The impenetrable scales that can't be cut into anything useful? The meat that's probably so laced with magic eating it would do some very nasty things to you?'

\'The venom,\' Salazar snapped. \'The rest is meant to be useful

when it's *alive*.\'

\'I\'m not going anywhere near that thing\'s mouth again. One dose of venom was enough for me.\' He shuddered at the memory of it burning through his veins. 'More than enough.'

\'You were bitten?\'

\'Phoenix tears.'

\'About the only things the ridiculous birds produce that\'s useful,\' Salazar grumbled. \'Helga had one of the silly things; it never did anything except steal fruit and set fire to things. Snakes are far better.\'

*Because you're not at all biased.*

\'I quite like phoenixes. Fawkes saved my life. My wand even has a

phoenix feather core.'

Salazar stroked the head of his snake. \'I\'d bet it\'s a powerful, but rather limited wand. Phoenix feather wands don't excel at some of the more delicate aspects of magic.\'

\'Why not?\'

\'Not sure. It might have something to do with their elusive but powerful and emotive nature. Helga and I studied hers for a bit, but we were mostly guessing.\' Salazar furrowed his brow. \'You should get your wand checked, really. That ritual can sometimes have an effect on it.\'

Harry clutched his wand to his chest. \'It can?\'

\'That\'s why I told you to leave it outside of the runes. You\'ve slightly changed your magic, inevitably that will have some effect on the conduit you use to channel magic.\'

'What *kind* of effect?\'

\'Most of the time it\'s nothing. Neither I nor Tom Riddle ever noticed a difference, but I heard of instances when the person needed their wand length changed, a different type of wood, or even a new core. I wouldn\'t worry about it. You could just have a new one made or, if you can\'t afford it, don\'t. The old one might not be a perfect match, but it will still work very well for you.\'

\'I see.\' Harry pulled the cold, wet front of his robes away from his skin and shivered. \'I should leave.\'

\'Visit soon,\' Salazar said. 'Take it easy for a day or two, though.

Rituals can take some time to recover from.\'

'Well, it's not like I'm involved in anything dangerous.'

Salazar snorted, settled down in his frame and closed his eyes.

Harry left the portrait to nap. \'Hey, Myrtle,\' he called on his way past the cubicle.

\'Have you been down here *all night?\'* Myrtle swooped out of her cubicle, her cheeks flushed silver.

\'Yes, but you can\'t tell anyone. I *really* need somewhere that\'s just for me at the moment.\'

She flashed him a small smile. \'I won\'t share, Harry. You\'re the only person that ever comes to talk to poor Myrtle.\'

\'Thanks.\' He pulled a wide smile onto his face. \'I have to go change. I\'m all wet.\'

Myrtle giggled. \'I noticed.\' She zipped into her cubicle with her hands clasped over her mouth.

*Odd.* Harry eyed the closed door of Myrtle\'s cubicle, then headed for Gryffindor Tower. *Oh well.*

\'Mr Potter.' Professor McGonagall caught him on the staircase up

to the Fat Lady\'s picture. 'Where have you been?\'

*I was practising what's probably considered dark magic in the*

*Chamber of Secrets.* Harry held his tongue.

Professor McGonagall drew herself up. \'And why are you *wet?\'*

\'I performed the water-summoning spell a little too proficiently.\' \'That\'s a sixth year spell, Mr Potter.\' Some of the stiffness faded

from her posture and her eyes softened. 'Very well done. It needs to be,

too, since as Triwizard champion, you're excused from all lessons you don't

wish to attend.\'

*No more potions.* A grin slipped onto his lips. *Every cloud has its silver lining.*

\'I hope that smile has nothing to do with not having to attend your lessons, Mr Potter,\' Professor McGonagall chided. \'You\'ve come forwards in leaps and bounds from last year, but this tournament is still much too dangerous for any child, let alone a fourth year. I can\'t believe so many of the younger years would have the irresponsibility to try and enter their names.\' She swept off.

The Fat Lady gave him a cool look, but swung out of his way.

*Really? Even the portraits?*

A tense, thick quiet fell over the common room. Harry ignored the stares and strode upstairs to his dormitory. Dull white hangings dangled from around his bed.

*Petty.* He dispelled the charm with a tap of his wand, then checked for anything untoward. *If Ron's set the twins on me, this could be a long year.* Harry discarded his wet robes onto the pile of not-so-clean clothes and clawed on some clean ones.

\'H-Harry.\' A quiet shuffle came from the dormitory's doorway.

\'Neville.\'

Neville steepled his fingers and pushed his hands together. \'I\'m sorry about the others, Harry. They\'re just angry that you told them you wouldn\'t enter, didn\'t want to, and still managed to come away with something they all wanted.\'

\'Do you believe I put my name in, Neville?'

He shuffled his feet. \'I don\'t think it really matters. I didn\'t ever want to take part, but everyone else, they were so hopeful.\'

*Well, now they know where just hoping gets us.*

Harry sighed. \'If I could\'ve, I would\'ve swapped with them, Nev.'

\'Yeah, I know, but that doesn\'t mean all that much when you

can\'t.\'

*He\'s right*. *It doesn\'t matter what I say or what I wanted. I still*

*have what they were after and the fact I didn't want it probably makes it worse.*

\'Anyone share your opinion?\' he asked. \'Or is it just you?\'

\'Most of the younger students are annoyed you managed to get past Professor Dumbledore when they couldn\'t, the older ones are resentful, *especially* Angelina, and Ron, Seamus, and Dean were really angry.\'

\'I\'ll take that as a no, then.\'

\'Lavender, Parvati, and some of the girls in our year and below don\'t mind. Hermione seems more worried about you and wherever you\'re spending all your time than anything to do with the Triwizard Tournament. It\'s Angelina Johnson and the few who were tipped to be champion who you need to watch out for. They\'re *really* not happy you stole their place.\'

\'I didn\'t *steal* anything, Neville.\'

'Well, I don\'t think you're going to be seeker next year.\' Neville

stared at his toes. 'I don't think you're going to be very popular for a while.' \'I've dealt with that before. Remember second year?\'

'Gryffindor house stuck by you in second year,\' Neville muttered. 'Angelina's made pretty sure that won't happen.'

*Stupid bloody girl.* Harry watched him shuffle away with ice coursing through his veins. *Is Angelina that upset she didn't get picked? Cedric got chosen over her anyway.*

Harry wandered back down to the common room with a tight, cold ball caught up in his chest.

Lavender and Parvati giggled by the fire. They shot him brief glances with soft eyes and turned away. He slumped down and stared into the flames.

\'There you are, Harry.\' A hand came down on either of his shoulders and the Weasley twins appeared on either side of him.

He let his wand slide down his sleeve into his palm. 'What do you two want?'

'No need for concern, Harrikins. We\'re not against you.\' They pulled up two chairs of their own, each sitting on the chair their brother had brought.

\'You believe me?\'

\'If we couldn\'t get past the age line, how could an ickle fourth year?\' They smiled and shook their heads. \'That\'s not it at all.\'

\'Besides, even if you did, then we\'d only tip our hats to you for tricking the headmaster himself. Right, George?\'

\'Right, Fred. The problem we face is far more tricky. Fred and I, we\'re quite close to Angelina and Alicia. Girls, you know.

'Well, you don't, but you will one day, eh, Harrikins.'

Fred shrugged. 'We don\'t want to ruin that, so I\'m afraid we\'ll have to be keeping our distance a bit. Ginny, too. Ron\'s already written home some garbled version of events and told her to stay away from you.\'

\'She didn\'t look too happy about it, though, did she, Fred?\' \'Indeed not, George. She hexed our littlest brother good, but she

said she really wants to join the quidditch team next year... and you know

Angelina will hold a grudge, Alicia too.\'

\'They haven\'t forgiven us for swapping on our double date with them yet,\' Fred said. \'And that was almost a year ago.\'

\'No pranks and no hard feelings.\' They patted Harry on the shoulder and left him by the fire.

Harry stared into the flames' flickering orange light. *Hermione better believe me, or I might as well just move in with Salazar.*

He tossed another log onto the fire and watched the flames curl over it. It cracked and popped, scattering sparks over the front of the grate. Ash trickled from the crevices of the log down into the cooling pile of embers.

'Screw this.' Harry thrust himself out of the chair and wandered

toward charms.

*Hermione always gets there early.*

He stuck his head round the door. Empty chairs lingered between bare desks. Harry slipped into a seat in the back corner of the class.

\'Mr Potter!\' Professor Flitwick bounced into his classroom. \'I was under the impression that you were excused from classes.\'

\'I\'m excused from the ones I don\'t want to attend, sir,\' Harry said. \'Oh! Your mother always loved charms, it must run in the family.

You\'re almost as early as she used to be!' Flitwick teetered on the balls of

his feet. 'Do you have questions for me? Miss Granger normally comes

early with questions.\'

\'I\'m keeping up fine, professor. I\'ve actually gotten a little ahead.\'

\'That\'s great news!' A giant smile spread across Flitwick's face. 'You\'ll need the time to prepare for the tournament. Where have you managed to get up to so far?\'

A brief warmth surged through Harry's chest and a hot lump rose into his throat. \'I\'ve finished all of it.'

\'All of it?!\' Professor Flitwick's jaw dropped. \'But... it\'s *October*!\'

\'I did some reading over the summer.' \'Quite a lot of reading by the sound of it.'

Flitwick pulled his wand out and waved it at his desk. The cap of an ink bottle unscrewed itself and floated over. \'Can you demonstrate your banishing charm for me, Mr Potter? It would certainly ease my worries about you being a champion.\'

Harry flicked his wand.

The cap hissed across the classroom and pinged off the window. \'Excellent!\' Professor Flitwick cried. \'Non-verbal as well. I wonder

why you even came to class today, Mr Potter. You're well ahead of all your

peers.\'

Hermione cleared her throat from the door to the classroom.

'Professor?'

\'Miss Granger. Your friend has just been demonstrating his astonishing grasp of the banishing spell. Quite exemplary for a fourth year!\'

Hermione's eyes darted to Harry's wand. \'I had a question about

our essays, Professor.\'

\'It\'s a bit late now, Miss Granger. I\'m collecting them at the start of

class.\'

\'Oh.\'

\'Er, Professor Flitwick...\' Harry slid his wand back into his sleeve. \'I

haven\'t got my essay.\'

\'Don\'t worry, Mr Potter. You clearly are in no need of the revision that essay provides. You\'ve been excused from classes regardless, remember.\'

Harry released a quiet sigh. \'Thank you, professor.'

\'You can perform the banishing charm?\' Hermione whispered as the other students filed in looking remarkably under eager. 'You said it looked interesting, not that you'd already mastered it!'

'I thought it might come in useful. It's about time I took some of this stuff more seriously, there's only so many times I can luck my way out of life-threatening scenarios.\'

\'That\'s probably wise of you. I'm impressed, Harry.\' Hermione

pursed her lips. \'Is that where you\'ve been disappearing off to then?\'

A smile crept onto Harry's lips. \'Yeah. I needed to practise somewhere.\'

\'How far have you got?\'

Harry weighed the words on the tip of his tongue, measuring the spark of competition burning in Hermione's eyes. \'I\'ve reached a lot of the sixth year material in both charms and transfiguration.'

\'That\'s amazing, Harry!\' She glanced around and lowered her voice. 'Seriously. I saw you trying to summon butterflies, but I thought it was a one-off attempt. You've gotten so good, so *fast*.\'

'I\'ve got the hang of that butterfly spell now. If it wasn't for this

bloody tournament, I might've managed loads of new stuff this year.\'

Hermione crossed her arms. \'I can\'t believe you\'re ahead of me in two classes now*.*\'

Harry glimpsed more than a touch of envy in her eyes. \'You\'ll still be as good as me at potions, our electives, and you\'re *miles* better than me at any essays.'

\'Charms and Transfiguration are my favourites after Arithmancy, though.\' Hermione sighed. \'And now you\'re better than me at them. I'll have to get the hang of the banishing charm this week now, too.\'

*Have to?* Harry raised an eyebrow. *Really? Why does she always feel like she needs to know more than me? Still, at least she's not having a strop about losing her chance to be slaughtered by a sphinx or whatever Hagrid's new pet turns out to be.*

Flitwick handed a pair of small, clay tiles to them. 'Repairing charm,' he squeaked. 'A very useful one indeed.'

Harry nudged Hermione's elbow. \'Do you think I put my name in?\' \'Honestly? I don't think so, but I\'m not certain. You\'ve been

different since the World Cup. Distant, withdrawn, but, I don't know, more

*driven*. I don\'t know what you\'re thinking like I used to.\' She poked her clay tile round in a circle with the tip of her wand. 'Is it me? Is it because now you know all this stuff, you don't need me to help anymore? So you don't need to talk to me?'

\'You're my friend, Hermione.' Harry trapped her tile under his hand. 'If I just wanted someone to tell me facts, I'd go to the library or ask a teacher.' He shook his head. 'I didn't put my name in. I promise. You know how this stuff is for me, anything remotely weird and I get sucked into it somehow.'

*Well, not somehow, usually Voldemort.* Harry froze, a little chill trickling down his spine. *Let's hope it's not this time.* A bitter twist of humour bubbled up onto his tongue. *Yes, let's wish it's not him, that'll work.*

'That's true.\' Hermione dropped her tile onto the desk.

It shattered across the hard wood, spilling clay fragments over the ink-stained surface.

'But you're not acting like you did before. You used to get sucked into dangerous stuff and, well, play the hero, I guess. It was never about *you*. This isn't like that. It's dangerous, but it's a game. And it's all about the champions. About *you*. You can't pretend you're not competitive. I've seen you play quidditch. You must want to win a *bit*.'

'It's not worth winning. It's a stupid idea. A thousand galleons and

your name in a paper in return for a very high chance of being killed.\'

*Something worth winning.* Harry buried the echo of Salazar's words somewhere he couldn't hear them. *Maybe a bit, deep down.*

Hermione flashed him a smile. \'At least you aren\'t the Heir of

Slytherin.'

*Yeah, that would be terrible*.

\'I\'m sure it\'ll all pass, just like things did that year.\'

\'I had to kill a basilisk to prove my innocence! And nobody in Gryffindor listened to the rumours back then.\'

\'It\'ll be fine.\' Hermione tapped the tile with her wand and watched it creep back together into a square, marred only by a few thin, dark lines. \'Ron will get over it, he always does. When it becomes clear you didn\'t put your name in, everyone will feel rather stupid and come to apologise.\'

\'I\'m not sure I want them back,\' Harry whispered.

\'Harry!\' Hermione's tile slipped through her fingers and shattered. \'They\'re your *friends*.\'

\'They aren\'t acting like it, are they? You wouldn't see me acting

like that if it was them.\'

\'But it\'s not really their fault. You must realise what it looks like to them. You cast a bit of a shadow, Harry, and it just keeps getting bigger.\'

'If they want to be friends with me, then they should know me well enough to see me through it.\' He scowled at her tile as it flowed back into a perfect, clay square. \'If they don't know me well enough to get past that, then they can't really be my friends, can they?\'

'Just because they know better doesn't mean they can help themselves from reacting. Nobody can.' Hermione gnawed at her lip. 'Even me. Look at you, suddenly as good at me at everything, with all the popularity and fame I'll never have. Why would you need some muggleborn girl hanging off your coattails? And I know that's not how you see it, but sometimes it's all I can think about.'

*So she has to be better than me.* A smooth whisper bubbled up from the back of his skull, spilling through his thoughts like blood across his palm. *Because if she's better than me, I'll need her.* A shard of ice froze beneath his ribs. *Did she not think I might stick by my friends just because they're my friends?*

'That's stupid.' Harry shook his head and swept his bag back up

onto his shoulder.

Hermione chewed her lip, crossed her arms and huffed. 'What? I can't *help* it! None of the others are any better!'

*No. You're just as bad as the others.* He bit his tongue before the words slipped out and stalked out. *Maybe if I'm better than you often enough, you'll realise it doesn't matter. You can just be my friend, then.*

\'Shouldn\'t you be in lessons, Potter?\' Malfoy sneered at him from the end of the charms corridor.

\'Shouldn\'t *you?\'*

\'I heard your housemates have finally realised what a pretentious, pathetic person you are.' Malfoy smirked. \'Even Weasley doesn\'t want anything to do with you. How does it feel to be ditched by a charity case?\'

Harry glanced up and down the empty corridor. *Just the two of us*.

He slipped his wand from his sleeve. \'Anything else you\'d like to say?' He placed the tip between Malfoy\'s eyes. \'I know a wonderful number of hexes now.'

\'You wouldn\'t dare.'

\'Try me.\' Harry dragged his widest, brightest smile onto his face. \'Please, try me. Give me an excuse.\'

\'You think you\'re such a big shot, Potter,\' Malfoy snarled. \'You\'re not. Everyone knows you\'re just a cheat and a liar now.\' He shoved himself out from under Harry\'s wand. 'Look at you, all alone. And no *wonder*---'

\'You\'ve grown brave, Malfoy.\' Harry smothered a twist of pain and clawed his smile back over his lips. \'Talking back to someone who has you at wand point and walking around the castle without your lackeys.

*Aguamenti*.\'

*Nothing.* His thoughts echoed from the back of his mind in Riddle\'s voice. *I was nothing for eleven years. No name. No hope. Barely even existing. This spoilt brat understands nothing.*

A stream of water burst from his wand tip, drenching Malfoy in

water.

'Potter,' he spluttered. 'I'll see you in so many detentions for this!' Harry laughed. 'No you won't. Not unless you want to admit I

bested you with a water conjuring charm of all things.' He grinned. \'You probably should've kept your newfound bravado in check, Draco. It's really not done you any favours.'

\'I hope you die in the tournament, Potter.\'

\'I doubt you\'re the only one, but I\'m afraid I\'ll have to disappoint you.\' Harry slipped his wand back into his sleeve and out of sight. \'Oh, and Malfoy, if I find out you or *your father* have anything to do with my name coming out of the goblet, I\'m going to make you wish you'd been competing in my place.\'

# Curiosity Piqued

A torrent of students poured through the corridors. Tapestries and hangings swayed on the walls in the wake of their passing. Snoozing portraits cracked open their eyes to frown and scowl at the hubbub below them.

Fleur stuck her fingers out of the shadows of her alcove into the bright beam of light spilling through the window. Her disillusioned fingers weren't even a ripple in the air. *That'll suffice.*

The thick, wooden door opposite her hiding place creaked open and a knot of Hogwarts pupils sauntered out.

Fleur leant against the wall and watched her youngest competitor slip off the back of the group of students. *The fourth champion.* She tossed her hair over her shoulder and crept out into the corridor. *In the Triwizard Tournament. What nonsense.*

He paused on the balls of his feet as the corridors emptied and the noise faded, then turned on his heel and stepped right into her.

The boy's glasses skittered across the floor.

'Merde.' Fleur abandoned her spell, then plucked his glasses off the floor and stepped back from his outstretched hand. 'You're Harry Potter, non?'

'So everyone keeps telling me.' The boy squinted at her. 'I'm afraid you're a sort of silvery-blue blur...'

*Oh? You can't see me?* Fleur smiled. *Perfect.*

'How did you get your magic round the age line?' she asked.

Ice crept into the boy's green eyes. 'I didn't.'

*Vraiment?* Fleur tossed her hair over her shoulder. *Your magic cannot cross an age line if you're not older than the age set. It's a simple ward, if an archaic one.*

'You did not break Albus Dumbledore's ward, everyone in the castle would've noticed.' She held his glasses out. 'So how did your name get in?'

He reached for his glasses, but she pulled them back from his fingers. 'Really?' There was ice in his voice, too. 'Why do you care? You don't even know me.'

'I can't think of a way to get around the ward and still have my name go into the goblet,' Fleur said. 'I'm good with wards.'

'Well if you think of one, let me know. I'd be *very* interested.'

Fleur cast the disillusionment charm over herself just as he lunged and tugged his glasses out of her fingers. She stepped back against the wall as he twisted round with narrow eyes. His wand slid from his sleeve into his hand.

'Weird girl.' The boy strode down the corridor. 'Why do people care so much about this death trap tournament?'

*The only way past an age line is to conceal your magic completely. Impossible for any fourteen year old.* Fleur pursed her lips. *But that makes no sense, because then Dumbledore must've staged the whole thing. And that's just ridiculous.*

Harry Potter's footsteps faded round the corner. 'Merde, he's getting away.' She hurried after the boy.

Fleur tracked him through the Great Hall to the foot of the moving staircases.

*The only thing I like about this school and they're completely impractical.* She darted up the steps as the boy stepped off and the stairs shifted.

Harry Potter paused in the middle of a corridor and glanced up and down.

*Maybe Dumbledore wanted an extra bite at the apple.* Fleur edged along the line of the wall. *But then why choose a fairly unremarkable looking fourth year? Apart from being slightly resistant to my magic and that scar, there's nothing obviously special about him.*

The boy slipped through a door near the corridor's end.

Fleur tip-toed after him and choked. *A girls' bathroom! What kind*

*of fourteen year old is he?!*

A girl's voice echoed from within. Fleur pressed her ear to the

door, but the words remained muffled, even the boy's deeper voice.

Silence fell.

Fleur pulled her head back from against the door, checked her charm, then eased the door open and crept inside.

A row of empty cubicles, a large central sink, and a sizeable puddle of water spread across the white tiles.

'Merde.' Fleur turned her nose up. 'That's it. I'm not wasting another second on him. I've other competitors to keep an eye on, ones that actually have a chance of winning.'

*If there's anything special about him, it'll show up during the tournament's tasks anyway.*

She shoved the bathroom door open and strode out. Grey clouds stretched beyond the small, high windows and the carpet stretched away below portraits and tapestries of goblin warbands. 'And now I'm lost. How annoying.'

Fleur wandered the corridors back in what she hoped was the direction she'd come. *But knowing magical architecture, it's anything but. Just my luck.*

\'Honestly, Ron.\' The bushy-haired girl Fleur'd seen near Harry Potter on occasion dragged a gangly redhead into an empty classroom. \'This spat with Harry is getting well out of hand.\'

*Or maybe not.* Fleur double-checked her disillusionment, then tip- toed to the door.

\'I\'m not the one who lied to his friends, Hermione!' Ron's balled fists waved about either side of Hermione's bushy hair. Fire flashed in his eyes.

\'We both know Harry\'s promise isn\'t what this is about. He\'s either telling the truth, or he lied to spare your feelings, neither of which you can really blame him for, especially given how you've all reacted!\'

Ron's scowl deepened. \'Then what\'s it about?\'

\'It\'s about you, and half of Gryffindor House by the appearance of it, taking out your dissatisfaction at being in Harry\'s shadow out on Harry. He can\'t control his fame, Ron. You know that.\' Hermione huffed and crossed her arms. \'Harry isn\'t taking this well. He\'s been acting off since the World Cup. You\'ve seen how distant he\'s become. You and Angelina are driving him further and further away. I know you\'re angry now, but you\'ll regret losing your friend the moment you calm down.\'

Ron grunted. \'I won\'t lose him. This sort of thing happens between us guys sometimes. He\'ll apologise for lying and I\'ll apologise for

overreacting. The air will clear and things will go back to the way they were. It\'s how we work.\'

\'That\'s how you and the old Harry worked,\' Hermione snapped. \'The new Harry is as good as me at half the subjects we take, better at a few of them, and seriously considering ending his friendships with all of you for good.\'

\'You aren\'t serious,\' Ron's face turned a mottled red beneath his freckles. \'He\'d never say that. We argue, yeah, and this time has been bad, but he'd never walk away from us. He can\'t. He\'s *Harry* and even if I can\'t stand him at the moment, we\'re still friends.\'

\'*I\'m not even sure I want them back*. Those were his exact words. For pity\'s sake, Ron, swallow your pride, drag Seamus, Dean, and anyone you can with you, apologise, and hope the old Harry resurfaces to forgive you, because I'm afraid if you don't, we won't ever see him again!\'

Fleur pursed her lips. *They'll apologise, then do it all again. If the boy's smart, he'll learn from his mistake instead of repeating it.*

\'I'll think about it.\' Ron shuffled his feet. \'I didn\'t realise he\'d taken it so badly. You think something happened to him, over the summer, or at the World Cup? Those bloody muggles?\'

\'I don\'t know, Ron. I only know what he's said, which isn't much. Maybe that Bulgarian Veela did something, or someone else did before she found him.\'

*Veela? He's met one of us before?*

\'You think he got cursed while he was out of it?\'

\'He was very vague about his story, Ron, and he\'s been secretive since then. Maybe he wasn\'t even unconscious at all.\'

\'He was pretty out of it in the hospital wing, Hermione. You can\'t exactly fake magical exhaustion and a coma.\'

\'He said he doesn\'t remember casting any spells.\' Hermione shook her head. \'Some things don\'t really add up about that.\'

Ron shot her a half-pitying, half-amused stare.

\'They don\'t!\' She huffed. 'It doesn't matter. You need to fix this, then drag Harry to play quidditch, or cards, or whatever instead of studying. And then you'll need me to try and make you two actually do some work.' She smiled and her gaze lost focus. 'It'll be like before.'

\'I\'ll try.' Ron grimaced. \'Angelina Johnson's still on the warpath. Katie Bell was literally *pleading* with her to change her mind about kicking Harry from playing seeker next year and she wasn't having any of it.\'

\'She really believes he entered?\'

'Yeah.'

Hermione sighed. \'Professor Dumbledore seemed to think Harry entered; he looked very disappointed.\'

\'You think he actually might've secretly entered himself using his

cloak?'

Fleur rolled her eyes. *No fourteen year old's charmed cloak is*

*going to get him across an age line cast by Albus Dumbledore.*

\'I don\'t know. I just don\'t know. He's changed. Professor Dumbledore looks troubled, too. Every time he sees Harry, he gets this worried, haunted look.\'

\'I\'ll apologise,\' Ron said. \'I won't bloody like it, because he's been a

right git about the whole thing, but I\'ll encourage Ginny to speak to him

again, and I\'ll try to convince Seamus, Dean and the others to back off a bit.

Won't be any bloody fun, though. Ginny's going to hex me again.\'

\'Thanks, Ron. He flipped out on me and left Charms. I've barely

seen him since.\'

*So I\'m not the only one he\'s evading*. Fleur recast her disillusionment. *I used to avoid everyone when I was younger. Everyone except Gabby.*

\'We\'ll have to find him to apologise,\' Hermione said.

\'He comes back to the dormitory quite late most days.\' Ron waved an arm at the ceiling. \'I\'ll gather everyone in the common room and we can catch him then.\'

\'That\'s a pretty good plan,\' Hermione muttered.

Ron snorted. \'Chess player, remember. Plus, if you've not figured out where he\'s going in over a month, we aren\'t going to in the next couple of days.\'

Fleur scowled. *He's good at vanishing, not that it will help him*

*much in the tournament.*

The two English fourth years swept out of the empty class. Fleur muddled her way back to the flying carriage.

The other girls were scattered across the grass, swaddled in scarves and jumpers. Caroline, Emilie, and most girls her age were busy ogling the Durmstrang boys relaxing shirtless on the deck of their ship.

Fleur headed back toward her own room, then paused before her

headmistress' office. \'Madame Maxime?\' \'Yes, come in, Fleur.'

\'Do you know anything about age lines, madame?\'

Madame Maxime steepled her huge fingers. \'Why do you ask? It cannot possibly be for the tournament.\'

Fleur kept a straight face. \'I was curious. Albus Dumbledore used

one. I've not seen the ward actually cast before.\'

Madame Maxime nodded. \'They\'re interesting, but quite useless. I don\'t doubt I'm the only one of your teachers who knows much more than the name of the enchantment. They're designed to allow passage to magical beings provided the age of the being's magic meets the requirement. They're so simple they can't be bypassed in the same way more conventional wards might, but very inflexible in their use. It's not a ward you'll ever really need to use, Fleur.\'

\'Thank you, madame,\' Fleur replied.

*Harry Potter must've found a way*. *Perhaps someone older with the same name who didn't care about breaking a magical contract let him take their place.*

She slipped into her room, closed the door, then locked it. 'It doesn't matter. I was chosen because I'm better than all the other girls at Beauxbatons and I'm definitely better than some fourth year.' She dragged the mirror up and stared at her reflection's bright, blue eyes. 'I'm going to win. As always.'

# To Err is Human

A procession of battered portraits with cracked paint lined the walls between millennium-old tapestries and gleaming suits of armour. Harry drifted past them, brushing the crumbs of his lunch off his robes to join the crumbs of his breakfast.

*Stupid bloody Hermione.* He hurled the last bite of his sandwich into the face of a suit of armour. *And her stupid bloody obsession with being better than everyone. And her stupid bloody fear of not being needed.*

Harry slipped his wand out of his sleeve and vanished the chunk of sandwich. 'She's going to have even fewer friends than me if she keeps this stupid bloody stuff up.' He stuffed his wand back away. 'And I *still* need somewhere to practice while I'm using the time-turner in the Chamber of Secrets.'

A door appeared between two tapestries.

Harry paused. 'Well, if that's not bloody suspicious, I don't know what is.' He glanced up and down the corridor, then twisted the latch. 'There better not be another three-headed hellhound in here.'

Empty, white walls glistened inside.

Harry shrugged. *Needs some targets, but it'll do.*

The dark drew together in the corners, looming into skeletal silhouettes draped in robes of tattered shadow.

'The Room of Requirement.' Harry grinned. 'Salazar wasn't just making it up, then. This is perfect.'

He slipped out, closed the door, and watched it melt back into the stonework. *Absolutely perfect.*

Harry hurried to the chamber, sprinting down the stairs and jumping over the bridge the moment it rose from the water.

'I found the Room of Requirement.' His words vanished into gasps and he doubled over the desk until his breath returned. 'I found the Room of Requirement.'

Salazar raised an eyebrow. 'Really?' 'Yes.'

'Where?'

'Sixth floor corridor. I was wandering around and it just appeared.' Harry waved a hand at the small golden hourglass. 'I can use the time- turner there.'

'No.' Salazar patted his serpent's head. 'The hourglass can't leave the Chamber of Secrets. I'm sure I told you that already, you forgetful brat.'

'You might've done.' Harry feigned thought. 'But perhaps you're

just going even more senile than you already are.'

'Ungrateful little wretch.' Salazar muttered a few choice words in parseltongue. 'You can go to the Room of Requirement, then come back here and repeat the time in the Chamber. Prevents you from seeing yourself, too, though since you know what you're going to be doing, it shouldn't really be an issue.'

'No paradoxes?'

Salazar snorted. 'Why on earth would the entirety of existence disappear because there's two of you for a short while. Even *you* can't cause that much trouble.' He shook his head. 'Time and space are flexible

things, not straight lines. The time-turner just helps bend them a bit further

around yourself.'

Harry repeated that to himself a couple of times. 'I feel like it takes

a considerable amount of study to really understand what you just said.' Salazar chuckled. 'I'd take my word for it, it'll be quicker.'

'I've used one before and I'm pretty sure I saw myself, I just didn't realise it was me until afterward.' Harry frowned. 'I made a self-fulfilling loop.'

'You will have to every time you use it.' Salazar's serpent coiled around his face. 'Get off you wretched creature.' The portrait peeled it off with its free hand and tied it into a knot. The snake squirmed round his neck, bumping his chin with its knotted tail. 'Now, why are you here?'

'I've got a list. Apparition. Mind arts. The Disillusionment Charm. Some random French girl stole my glasses, tried to interrogate me, then vanished. I'm pretty sure she disillusioned herself and it looked useful.'

'The Mind Arts are something of a specialty of mine.\' Salazar straightened his snake out along his shoulders. 'If you don't stay still, you annoying piece of living upholstery, I'm going to transfigure you into a worm.'

Harry pretended he hadn't heard that. \'I discovered some muggle mind exercises that help you clear your mind and focus. They seem like they'd be the same as the magical ones, but I can't easily get into the restricted section to check.\'

\'Occlumency is the art of shielding your mind. It\'s a bit of a misnomer, actually. What you really do is empty your thoughts so an intruder can't see anything.\'

'Make sense.'

Salazar nodded. 'I imagine it would. My daughter was even more skilled than I was in the area. Tom was no amateur, either.'

'Is that all there is to it?'

Salazar crossed his arms. 'Not at all. Legilimency is only considered Occlumency's opposite by amateurs. It's all about seeing the thoughts of others. Mind magics are subtle, complex things. These labels, they don't really do it justice.' He stroked his chin. 'Best to start with apparition. It's very useful if you get into a tight spot.'

Harry nodded. 'So what do I do?'

\'Focus. Concentrate on your destination. Will yourself there. Make sure you're focused and your will is strong, otherwise you\'re liable to appear in multiple places at once and die. My heir will *not* die because he splinched himself. Godric would wet himself laughing in the afterlife.\'

Harry dragged the painting off the wall and over the bridge. 'What about the wards? I'm sure I've heard someone say you can't apparate in the school. Once. Twice. Maybe a hundred times.'

'The Chamber of Secrets isn't included within Hogwarts\' wards.' Salazar waved his hands around him. 'There was no point. It's already more strongly warded than the school. So even if the headmaster has turned on the anti-apparition wards, they won't affect you here.'

'Okay.' Harry pictured the far side of the chamber and tried to will

himself there.

His stomach lurched and his vision swam. 'Urgh.' Harry collapsed

to one knee and swallowed his breakfast back down. 'Bloody hell.'

'Well, that was awful.' Salazar tutted. 'What were you imagining?

Haven't you ever seen anyone apparate?'

Harry held his breath until his stomach settled. 'No. I haven't.'

\'You\'ve never seen anyone apparate? Have you been under a rock for the last fourteen years?\'

\'I was raised by and live with muggles.'

\'Oh.\' Salazar stared down toward the bottom of his frame. \'Well, that explains it. You should just appear in the space. Imagine it as if instead of you moving, some impossible force twisted the world instead, so you ended up standing where you pictured.\'

Harry considered it and took a few deep breaths. He pictured the tip of the forked, tongue-styled bridge and imagined the world wrenching back past him.

His magic twisted.

A loud crack echoed through the Chamber of Secrets and he found himself standing on the end of the bridge.

'Yes!' Harry grinned.

A wave of nausea and dizziness struck him, his vision spun and he fell. Ice-cold water smacked him in the face and closed over him.

Harry clawed himself out, shivering and sputtering. Salazar laughed so hard the snake fell off his shoulders. \'Shut up,\' Harry hissed, lapsing into parseltongue.

The nausea struck again as he clambered out and stood up. He doubled over and hurled his stomach onto the floor. A bitter taste flooded his mouth and burnt his throat.

\'You\'ll get used to the feeling.\' Salazar wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his robe. \'Godric was hopeless at any form of magical transportation for years. He\'d fall over whenever we apparated, so if we wanted to make a decent first impression, Helga would side-long him and hold him upright. He hated it.\'

\'I can empathise.\' Harry growled and wiped his lips, vanishing the contents of his stomach. An over-powered warming charm left him steaming and drove the cold from his limbs. He reapplied it several times until his robes dried.

\'You\'ll be fine. Keep practising.\'

\'You just want to watch me fall over,\' Harry grumbled.

Salazar's eyes softened. \'It reminds me of Godric.'

Harry visualised the far end of the chamber and reappeared there. He staggered, then fell to his knees. Salazar's laughter echoed from the far side of the chamber.

It took a further ten attempts before he could manage to remain upright and an additional five for him to do it without swaying or staggering all over the place like a drunk.

\'It\'s a good skill to learn,\' Salazar said. 'If you get disarmed and have to escape, apparition could save your life. The ability to quickly apparate saved my life more than a couple of times. Was there anything else you wanted to learn?\'

\'The disillusionment charm,\' Harry suggested.

*My invisibility cloak is great, but has its drawbacks.*

\'Not an easy one, not if you want to master it. It takes quite a bit of talent and control, the latter more than anything, to manage it flawlessly and become fully invisible.\'

Harry let his wand slide out of his sleeve and into his hand. 'I've time to practice.'

\'Well, you know what you should be visualising. You should be fairly adept at this spell, despite the phoenix feather.\'

Harry narrowed his eyes. 'Lay off my phoenix feather core wand

alone, you senile finger-painting.'

Salazar snorted and twirled his wand tip in front of his chest. 'The

wand motion's like that. I assume you know the incantation?'

Harry nodded and cast the spell. His body shifted to mirror the background behind it, blending hues like a watercolour. He moved his arm. Its colour rippled like a reflection on water, lagging behind the speed of movement.

\'Not a bad first attempt.' Salazar peered down at him. \'You look

like a very inexperienced, giant chameleon.\' Harry fixed him with a flat stare.

'It will take a great deal of practice before you can cast it well enough to move normally with it on. That\'s as far as most wizards or witches can ever get.\'

\'So it\'s camouflage, not invisibility.\' \'You aren\'t *most* wizards and witches.'

*Another Heir of Slytherin reference is about to be made.* Harry knew the proud expression on Salazar Slytherin\'s face well enough. *Great.*

*If only Tom Riddle could see this, he'd probably die of laughter... Or*

*outrage.*

\'You\'re my heir, not some lesser, *average* wizard. You're quite

gifted and you\'ll do better in time. I have no doubt.\'

*And there it is.*

He slid his wand away and sat down on the floor in front of the portrait. 'I can practice this by myself, then. Do you know anything else about the Room of Requirement?'

'Not really.\' Salazar threw his arms in the air. \'Only that I knew I

would win in the end! Take that Godric and Rowena.\' \'How did you win?\'

\'You\'re my heir. You found their secret room before anyone of their descent found mine.\'

Harry laughed. \'You do know that when I pulled the Godric\'s

sword out of the sorting hat I became his heir of sorts?'

\'So?\' Salazar froze mid-celebration.

\'I killed your basilisk with it. Here. In my second year.\'

The smile fell from Salazar's face. \'Well that rather ruins the competition. If you\'re heir to both of us, despite Godric\'s claim on you being rather less firm than mine, then we both win and it\'s all null and void.\'

*And now he's sulking...*

\'What was it like?\' Salazar murmured. \'Were their portraits there?

Godric's? Rowena's? Even Helga's, maybe?\'

\'I don\'t know. I think the room changes completely based on what you desire. I\'ll see if I can find their portraits next time I visit.\'

\'It sounds like an amazing room.' Salazar stared up through the roof of the chamber. \'I should like to try it myself, but I doubt it works for a shadow of life like me. Rowena and Godric always did come up with the most fanciful, spectacular things, of course most of them ended up exploding in Godric\'s face, but the ones that worked were truly amazing. Even I\'ll admit that they were the finest things any of us ever made, with the exemption of Hogwarts, of course. A school and sanctuary is magic of a different kind.\'

\'I\'ve only seen the sorting hat and the room,\' Harry said.

\'There were several more. The diadem you might've heard of, that was Rowena\'s favourite. She pretty much claimed it as hers, though Godric never really complained. He was rather selfless.\'

\'I wonder if any of them are in the room.'

\'The diadem was lost, sadly. Rowena\'s daughter stole it and lost it before she died. Silly girl.' Salazar's eyes darkened. 'Rowena really wasn't as brilliant a mother as she was a mage.\'

*Another sad memory.*

Harry frowned. \'What did Helga make?\'

\'She tried to combine enchanting with herbology. Plants were a hobby of hers. She liked looking after plants, creatures, and people. She\'s responsible for that ridiculously named species of magical tree.\'

\'Magical tree?'

\'She took an innocent, elegant willow tree and turned into something much less admirable. She wanted to plant a whole forest of

them to protect the school, but we intervened before she could cause a catastrophe. I think the species probably still exists, she grew and sold quite a few before people realised how large they would grow. I suspect they rapidly regretted planting them near their houses, or anything else for that matter. Horrible plants.\'

Harry laughed. \'The founders are nothing like I imagined.'

\'Of course we aren\'t. We founded a school. I\'m sure all the headmasters tell you how perfect and well behaved we were. The truth is that even at the age of sixty Godric was more a child than anyone to ever walk these halls after him.\' Salazar\'s eyes misted over. 'Rowena might've loved logic, but she broke any rules she thought she was better than, and Helga had a real vicious streak if you upset her.'

\'Tempus,\' Harry murmured. \'Time to leave.'

\'Yeah, I\'ll be back tomorrow.\'

\'You\'re not leaving before you\'ve put me back up over the door in the study.\' Salazar scowled. \'I refuse to spend any more time alone with that serpent, dead or not. You should milk her corpse, too. The venom is both very valuable and useful.\'

\'Fine.'

'At least those rituals have helped me get a bit stronger.' He picked his ancestor\'s canvas likeness up and carried it back across the bridge. 'Carrying you isn't quite as bad as it used to be.'

'Carrying me is an honour,' Salazar grumbled. 'I'm one of the greatest wizards to have ever lived.'

'That's probably why this painting is so heavy, it's your bloody ego.' Harry ignored Salazar's glare. \'Do you know anything that can be used to keep the venom from your former snake in?\'

\'Anything inert. It will only dissolve organic tissue or matter. There should be some crystal vials in one of the draws or lying around on the shelves opposite the ladder.\'

Harry grabbed a handful out of the top drawer, huffed the dust off them, and left to wrestle with the basilisk. *At least it will put up less of a fight this time.*

Harry knelt down in front of its mouth and shoved it open far enough to get his hands in. 'It could've swallowed me in one bite back then. It still could if it was alive.'

He reached past the teeth toward the venom sacs. *This is the part when I slice the gland open too far and dissolve one of my arms.* Harry cut a very small hole in the gland over the outstretched vial with his wand and watched the venom trickle into the crystal vial.

An uncomfortable, cramped series of seconds slid past until all four vials were full.

He left the venom to trickle down into the serpent and dissolve it, striding back into the study.

\'Did you get any?\' Salazar asked. \'You\'re still alive, so you didn\'t impale yourself on a fang.\'

Harry held up the four vials of thick, viscous, clear venom. \'That\'s a lot of galleons you\'re waving around. Leave the venom

here. It\'s very hard to come by.\'

Harry raised his eyebrows. \'Of course I'm leaving it here. I wasn\'t exactly going to leave it lying around in the dormitory for some idiot to drink by mistake.'

*Neville would probably drink it, too.* Harry shuddered. *That would not be a pleasant way to die.*

\'That would be very thoughtless of you,\' Salazar said. \'Horrible way to go. Makes some of the more morally questionable curses I\'ve seen look kind. You\'d sort of melt from within, I\'d imagine.\'

*Lovely.* Harry abandoned Salazar to gory thoughts and headed back toward his bed.

Gryffindor Tower\'s common room greeted him with a thick, tense silence and the soft crackle of flames. Ron, Seamus, and a handful of the others who'd decided his shadow was too much for them sat in the sofas and chairs around the fire.

He spared them no more than a glance and made his way towards the stairs.

\'Harry.\' Ron\'s voice caught him with one foot on the bottom step. They all spread around to stand at the base of the stairs. 'What?' He twisted to face them, letting his wand slip down his

sleeve to rest on his palm.

Ron\'s face contorted as if he was having problems breathing. \'Look.\' He glanced round at the others behind him. \'I\'m no good at talking things out, so I\'m just going to be frank. I know this hasn\'t been easy for you and I\'m not really certain you did put your name in the goblet. I\'m angry with you, we\'re all a bit mad, but we know it\'s not really your fault. You always get dragged into this stuff and come out looking like a hero. I

know you hate it, but it\'s hard for us to always be overlooked when standing next to you. We want a bit of that too, you know, and--\'

\'He\'s trying to say he\'s sorry,\' Hermione said. \'He\'s done a rubbish job of it, because he still needs some time to come to terms with things, but he means it. We all do.\' She fiddled with her wand. 'We just want things to be back like they were last year.'

*Back when you were better than everyone at everything.* A smooth, high voice welled up amongst his thoughts and Harry felt a tight, cold shard of ice freeze somewhere beneath his ribs. *Back when you were certain you were needed and didn't have to worry about actually being a good friend in order to stay one.*

He took a deep breath. \'So this is an apology?\'

His heart remained still and heavy. *I don\'t care.* The little ball of cold in his chest clamped tight. *It\'s too late.*

\'I\'m not sure I care anymore.\'

Hermione gasped. \'How can you *say* that?!\'

\'I opened my mouth, I remembered how I felt about having my entire house turn their backs on me, and I spoke,\' Harry snapped. \'The only conversations I\'ve had with any of you have been to listen to your explanations of why you\'re *avoiding* me.\'

\'We made a mistake,\' Ron muttered. \'You must realise what it looks like and how much pressure Angelina is putting on everyone with her grudge against you. Forget about all this. Water under the bridge. You forgive us. We forgive you. Friends again. Right, mate?\'

*But I don't forgive. And I can't forget.* Riddle's whisper echoed up from the base of his skull. *They left me all alone. To be nothing. Like all those empty years in Privet Drive.*

Harry tried to bury his thoughts, but the ice swirled through his blood unabated. 'Wrong, Ron. I don't trust you lot anymore. You didn't have my back when I needed you, I can't rely on you to have my back next time, so I'll make sure I won't need you.'

Hermione flinched.

\'Fine,\' Ron yelled. \'You selfish, pretentious git. Go and bask in your glory! I hope it was worth the deaths of your parents and the loss of your only friends!\'

Harry thrust his wand into Ron's face. \'What did you say?\'

Parseltongue slid off his tongue like water off snake scales.

Ron went red and swung his fist. He caught Harry on the head in a hot flash and he stumbled back onto the stairs. His wand clattered to the floor.

Ron hurled himself on top of Harry, swinging his fists like an angry chimpanzee. Harry shoved Ron off and smashed his left fist into his stomach. Someone grabbed the back of his robes and his left arm, but he tore himself free and lunged for his wand.

White light seared his eyes and his wand shot away from his grasp across the room, slicing past Seamus\' head.

It crunched into the mantelpiece, splinters raining down onto the

floor.

\'Oh *no*, I\'m so sorry, Harry.' Hermione stared at the pieces of his

wand, her fingers pressed over her mouth. \'I didn\'t *mean* to. I\'ve been practising the banishing spell and it was just the first one I thought of. I --- I just wanted to stop the fight.\'

*You were practising it because you needed to be better than me.*

His thoughts bubbled up in a fast, smooth, high whisper, so quick the

words almost slid together. Ice crept into Harry's veins.

He strode across the room and swept all the fragments into his

hand.

\'I didn\'t mean to do it, Harry,\' Hermione whispered.

'I don't care.' He clutched his handful of wand shards against his

chest. 'You still did it. We're done.' He searched for words to fit the fist of ice beneath his ribs. They welled up from the back of his head onto trembling lips. 'I don't need you anymore, Hermione. And I certainly don't want you.'

# Renaissance

The pieces of his loyal, holly and phoenix feather wand lay scattered across Salazar\'s desk. Harry brushed his fingertips over them. Cold, smooth wood rolled beneath his fingers.

\'They broke your wand,\' Salazar hissed. *\'Strike back!* Take from them what they took from you.' Slytherin\'s wand fountained a stream of silver sparks and his snake reared and bared its fangs. 'A wand is like a piece of *you*. They might as well have carved a chunk from your *flesh.*'

\'I\'m not going back. I\'ll never go back.\'

Salazar released a long breath. \'Perhaps that is wise. Revenge is the Ouroboros, never-ending and self-devouring.\'

'I\'m done with trusting them, though. Our friendship's over..\'

\'A bond for a bond. The friendship they held for the wand they

broke. I suppose that's fair.\'

\'You told me I would need my friends.\'

\'Individually weak creatures hunt in packs to bring down stronger prey,\' Salazar said. \'You were weak, striving to become powerful. This is no longer true and you continue to grow. There are still many wizards and witches stronger than you, but few here at Hogwarts can threaten you, Harry. Even if you stand alone.\'

\'I don't wish to stand alone.' Harry stared up at a dust corner of the ceiling. 'I was alone for a very long time before I came to Hogwarts. I don't want to go back to that.'

Salazar's green eyes softened and darkened. \'Neither did I. I found

equals who understood me. I built this school with some of them and I

would not be addressing my descendant if I had not one to spend my life with. You will be no different.\'

\'I need a wand,\' Harry murmured.

\'You do.\' Salazar offered Harry a small, gentle smile. \'Think of it not as replacing your old wand and its bond, but forging a new bond for the wizard you will one day become.\'

\'You changed wands.'

\'Twice. Once though my own foolishness and once from a loss such as your own.\' Salazar eyed the sad remnants of Harry\'s wand. \'I burnt mine to start anew, but perhaps you should take the fragments to whomever the best wand-maker is and ask about the subject. You might be able to keep an echo of your old partner with you.\'

\'Ollivander,\' Harry muttered. \'What?\'

\'The name of the best wand-maker I know is Ollivander.\'

\'I know the name,\' Salazar said. \'The family's been crafting wands for longer than this school has stood. My final wand came from the hands of a member of that family.\'

\'I\'ll have to go to Diagon Alley.\'

\'Go now. The tournament must be soon approaching.\'

Harry let out a short laugh. \'The wand-weighing ceremony is tomorrow.\'

So go *now*. You can apparate. Nothing is stopping you. Go. And take a vial of the basilisk venom with you. A wand-maker is an alchemist.

This Ollivander will appreciate the gift of such a rare substance if he's

worth his salt.\'

Harry stepped around his trunk and plucked one of the vials from the desk.

\'Take the fragments, Harry,\' Salazar murmured. \'It's worth asking, even if it comes to nothing, but do *not* come back without a wand. You have no time to wait.\'

Harry picked up each splinter and placed them into his cupped palm. He took a deep breath and in a disorienting whirl of the world, appeared in front of Ollivander\'s.

He patted himself down and glanced over each limb. *Nothing's*

*missing. Good.*

Harry stepped into the shop.

\'Mr Potter.\' Ollivander appeared from behind a teetering stack of wand boxes. \'Of all the people to next set foot in my shop, I was not expecting you.\'

\'Mr Ollivander.\' Harry edged out of the man's path as he swept

round behind his desk.

\'I remember selling you your wand, Mr Potter. Even if I forgot every single moment one of my wands found its partner, yours would be the last of my creations to fade from my memory. Holly, a supple wand, I daresay, and eleven inches.\'

\'Not anymore.\' Harry poured splinters onto the desk. Bright crimson beads welled up across his palm as he brushed them off his hand.

Ollivander's pale eyes misted. \'It is a terrible thing, Mr Potter, to

witness the destruction and end of something you have created. It does,

however, explain why you have come.\' He extended a long finger at the top of the vial sticking from Harry's pocket. \'Is that basilisk venom, Mr Potter?\'

Harry presented him with the vial. 'It is.'

\'I am not going to ask how you came by this, Mr Potter. I have heard rumours of the events of your second year. I\'m not going to ask how you came to be here when you should be far away, either. I will ask if you are sure?\'

Harry blinked. \'Sure?\'

*Did I miss something?*

\'When a wizard or witch brings me a magical substance to create a wand from for them, as some of the most dedicated to tradition do, I always ask if they are sure. It is not easy for one not very well educated in wand lore to make the best decision. We shall check, just in case.' Ollivander bustled into the back of the store, then returned with what seemed to be a pair of silver scales. \'A little blood if you please, Mr Potter. You have my word as a wand maker, I don't intend to do anything more with it.\'

Harry extended his hand. Ollivander pricked his finger and squeezed.

A single drop fell into one of the tiny silver bowls.

He set it down, unscrewed the vial and poured a single drop of the venom into the other bowl. \'The basilisk\'s venom will not be an easy thing to use as a wand core, Mr Potter. The venom consumes all that is alive, even the strongest wand woods. However, there are ways to counter its burn. Alchemy is an essential subject for a wand-maker.\'

Harry stared on as Ollivander hovered over the small set of scales, tapping his long, thin, pale wand against them every few seconds and murmuring beneath his breath.

\'Blood is a very potent magical medium, as all wizards know. It is easy to check whether your magic is strongly aligned to the substance, if you have the right tools and know-how.\' Ollivander tucked his wand away. \'The brighter the blue, the better the match.\'

Harry gestured at the pieces strewn on the desk. A slim golden strand protruded from one of them, like a string of flame. \'I was hoping I might not have to have a completely new wand. I gathered every splinter.\'

The scales emitted vibrant, bright, blue light.

*That\'s lucky.*

\'Mr Potter.\' Ollivander's pale eyes focused on a point somewhere between Harry's ears. \'If I did not know better, I would assume you to be competition for my role as Britain\'s premier wand-maker.\'

Harry raised an eyebrow. *Definitely missed something.*

\'Don\'t be modest, Mr Potter.\' Ollivander smiled, revealing crooked, white teeth. \'We both know basilisk venom dissolves organic substances completely. You cannot wander into my shop with such a substance, carrying the pieces of your former wand, and request a new wand that is not entirely new, then expect me not to realise your solution.\' He swept the pieces of Harry\'s former wand into his cupped palm. \'Perhaps this is not so much the destruction of your partnered wand as it is its rebirth. How very appropriate for a phoenix feather wand core.\'

Ollivander took a firm hold of Harry\'s shoulder and ushered him toward the back of the store. A small crafting area lurked beneath towering shelves of wand boxes.

*He's stretched the space.* Harry mentally placed the size of the back of the store over the shop. *It's three times as big in here as it looks from out there.*

\'I shall, of course, carry out your idea, ingenious that it is. I heard Gregorovitch once attempted something similar. His effort failed, but I feel this will work, and when it comes to wands, Mr Potter, feelings are everything.\'

Harry watched Ollivander extract every piece of phoenix feather under the assistance of a large magnifying lens. He fed them into the vial of venom with a pair of silver tweezers. Tiny streams of silver bubbles rose until the strands of feather were gone.

\'Your finger, Mr Potter.\' Ollivander set the same pair of silver scales down on the desk beside the basilisk venom and thrust a slim silver needle into the ball of Harry's forefinger.

Harry frowned at the nip of pain, dabbing the bead of crimson onto the scales. Ollivander dripped a droplet of the venom that now contained Harry\'s old wand core onto the scales and stared at them as if the meaning of life was reflected in their gleaming surface.

A bright blue flash stabbed at Harry's eyes.

\'Perfect,\' Ollivander whispered. \'Your magic seems to respond especially well to a fluid core, Mr Potter. It flows within you. The effect of certain misunderstood rituals, perhaps?\'

Harry met the man's pale eyes, picturing the circle of dark ink on

white parchment in the eye of his mind.

\'Don\'t fear, Mr Potter. The Ministry disapproves of many things it feels might not suit its purposes or propaganda. I've no doubt that if they did not want wands for themselves, they'd label many of my techniques

dark as well. You'll receive no judgement from me. The only question I

have for you is what wood should your wand be?\'

Ollivander wiped the silver scales clean with a black cloth and placed them to one side. A piece of parchment covered in thin slivers of wood floated down onto the desk in front of them.

'I'm not sure,' Harry said. 'Holly again?'

'Perhaps,\' Ollivander murmured, extending a long finger at Harry's hand. \'A third time if you would, Mr Potter. No need for blood this time. You will feel warmth from the wood that best suits you.\'

Harry eyed the parchment. *Holly. Oak. Ash. Hawthorn. There are a lot of options.*

Ollivander seized Harry\'s hand and pressed his forefinger against a sliver of holly. Ollivander\'s skin was as cool, soft, and papery as the worn pages of Salazar\'s oldest books. The piece of wood felt no warmer than Harry's skin.

\'Anything, Mr Potter?\'

Harry shook his head. 'I don't think so.'

\'If you are unsure, then it cannot be holly.\' Ollivander's silver eyes trailed down the parchment. He pressed Harry's finger against the darkest shard of wood. \'Perhaps this one.'

Heat flashed through Harry's fingertip and he flinched away.

Ollivander smiled. \'Ebony, Mr Potter. Not such a far cry from holly, you know. They are both woods that symbolise protection, but where holly is associated with sacrifice, ebony is associated with power.\'

The tape measures Harry remembered from before swept around the bookcase to envelop him in their grasp. They clicked and whirred as they swirled round him, covering what felt like every inch of his body.

\'Eleven and a third,\' Ollivander said. \'Best to be as precise and

thorough as possible with a wand of such potential.' Harry smiled. 'Thank you, Mr Ollivander.'

Ollivander's white, crooked teeth gleamed back. \'This part, Mr Potter, you cannot witness, despite the ingenuity of your idea. All wand- makers must have some secrets.\' He snatched the vial off the desk and vanished into the shelves, muttering beneath his breath.

A small thrill rippled through Harry. *I've just witnessed something*

*almost no other person to come here has seen*.

Harry leant on the desk and read the labels off the tower of boxes. Bright, eldritch light flickered from somewhere on the far side of the shop's backroom.

*Salazar's going to be delighted my new wand isn\'t a phoenix feather.* He chuckled and shook his head. *I wonder if the senile old picture had the same argument with Tom Riddle.*

\'I took my time.\' Ollivander appeared from behind a stack of wand boxes with all the warning of a particularly stealthy ghost. \'I could never rush a wand, let alone one like this.\'

Harry clenched his jaw until the ice faded from his veins and his heartbeat stilled.

'Ebony with a phoenix feather consumed by a basilisk's venom. A subtle wand but one of great power and emotion. This wand will excel at anything you put your heart into.' Ollivander presented Harry with a thin, long box just as he had over three years ago.

A long, dark length of wood lay inside. Warmth rushed from his palm to his shoulder as he touched the wand.

\'Go on, my boy,\' Ollivander whispered. \'Give it a wave.\' Harry twirled it in a small circle.

Another wave of warmth ran over him from head to toe. Intricate patterns of frost spread across the floor from his feet.

Harry grinned. 'It's perfect.'

\'The rebirth of a wand, Mr Potter,\' Ollivander murmured. \'A beautiful thing. Something I never thought I would witness. I daresay I won\'t make a wand quite like it ever again.'

\'I can't give you enough to compensate for this, Mr Ollivander,\' Harry said.

Ollivander shook his head. \'My wands cost seven galleons, Mr Potter, no more, no less. I would give you this for free, were ebony not so dear. I will likely never have the chance to create such a wand again. The venom you supplied to create it is likely worth enough gold to buy you every wand in this shop.\'

*That's a lot of wands... and gold.* Harry glanced around at the towers of boxes as he fished in his robes for the correct number of coins.

Ollivander tucked the galleons away. \'I have not sullied this wand by adding the Ministry\'s crude trace enchantment to it. Do you understand what I am saying, Mr Potter.\'

\'I do. Thank you.\'

*No more restrictions.* Harry's smile turned thin and cool. *The Dursley's are going to be very upset when they find out I can cast as much magic as I like now.*

\'Thank me by hurrying back to where you are supposed to be and trying a few of your best pieces of magic out before I see my work at the wand-weighing ceremony tomorrow.\' Ollivander laughed a soft, dry little laugh. \'Who else would conduct such a ceremony?\'

\'I certainly can\'t think of anyone better.'

\'You are too kind.\' Ollivander led him back to the front of the shop and ushered him out the door. \'Take care, Mr Potter. It is a long way for anyone to apparate, even for an emergency such as this.\'

Harry took a deep breath and spun the world back past him until he stood in front of Salazar.

'Fuck.' He poked at the soft skin where his left thumb nail ought to be. 'Well, better this bit than anything more important.'

\'Nails grow back,\' Salazar said. \'It\'s a good trade for a wand.\' Harry rubbed at the skin covering the top of his thumb.

\'You do have a wand, yes?\' Salazar peered down at him, his serpent slithering up atop his head and stared down at Harry. \'What is it?\'

\'Ebony, eleven and a third inches. My old phoenix feather dissolved in basilisk venom at its core.\'

\'He dissolved your old wand core in the venom and it worked as a

new core?\' Salazar stroked his chin. 'Most intriguing.'

\'He tested to see whether my magic was compatible with the venom and then with the venom with my old core. It was.' Harry smiled. \'He thought this was what I wanted from the beginning. I was lucky to come away with it, I suppose.\'

\'Carry me outside and show me a spell,\' Salazar urged. \'I want to

see.' He straightened up and gathered the serpent back off his head. 'I

mean that it\'s a good idea to familiarise yourself with your wand as quickly

as possible.'

Harry hid his smile as he carried the painting over the bridge. \'Reducto.' He whipped his wand in a sharp, small, sideways vee. His magic leapt forward like an eager puppy, flowing like water,

but as neat and fine as ink from the tip of a fountain pen. A flash of red light reduced one of the nearby serpent effigies into fine powder.

Salazar sighed. \'Stop breaking parts of my Chamber of Secrets.' 'I'm going to fix it.' Harry waved his wand at the dust and the

serpent statue reformed. 'You sound like an old housewife.'

Salazar crossed his arms. \'I'm Salazar Slytherin, one of the greatest mages to walk the world. I do *not* sound like an old housewife.'

'If you say so.'

Salazar tutted. 'How did the wand feel?\'

\'It\'s no stronger, but it feels *right*. Like I\'ve been painting with my finger all this time only to finally pick up the finest brush.\'

\'More refined, then?\'

\'Ollivander said something about my magic flowing and reacting well to a liquid core,\' Harry said. 'He said if my heart was in my magic, this wand would always work well.'

\'I\'ve never seen a liquid core wand. They\'re supposed to be very hard to create without making the wand fragile. Such a shame I can't take a look at yours.' Salazar released a long sigh. 'Try the disillusionment charm, that'll be a better test of your control.\'

Harry twirled his wand over himself and squinted his arms. \'I see no difference. I\'m still camouflaged.\'

\'I do,\' Salazar said. \'When you move your arms, your charm keeps pace, even with fast movements. A bit of practice and you\'ll be virtually undetectable.\'

Harry slipped his new wand into his sleeve. Little rushes and jolts warmth washed through and up his arm.

\'Don\'t put it away yet,\' Salazar groused. \'Do something exciting with it! Test the limits of your capacity! Try that basilisk conjuration you showed me the first time you carried me out here.\'

Harry grinned and let his wand slide into his hand. Heat vibrated through his fingers like a warm, summer wind through green leaves. He pictured the serpent rising from the waters of the pool and swept his wand up.

Every drop of liquid rose into the air. The conjured serpent swirled over the bridge, coiling over itself, its maw poised to strike, every bit as large as the corpse lying on the ground.

A deep, throbbing ache tugged at Harry's limbs. He resisted it for and grit his teeth, holding the conjuration aloft. The ache began to drag right at the core of his being and he slashed his wand forward.

The conjured basilisk crashed against the chamber wall like a breaking wave.

\'Was that exciting enough?\' Harry grimaced as the weariness

settled into his bones. 'It still took an awful lot out of me.'

\'Very.\' Salazar's eyes sparkled. \'Your control with that wand is *superlative*. No longer do you waste so much of your strength. You\'re going to be a very powerful wizard when you reach your majority, Harry.\'

\'I have to survive until seventeen for that,\' Harry muttered

Salazar cackled. \'The Triwizard Tournament won\'t know what hit it. I hope there\'s a duelling event. You\'re a much more promising heir than Tom ever was. He was refined and oh so focused, but lacked your natural power. He must have undertaken many rituals after he left here to become so feared as Lord Voldemort.\'

\'I suspect you're exaggerating.'

\'I am, but I\'m not lying. Tom was incredibly talented and very powerful, but so are you. You\'ll be the real Heir of Slytherin, *my* heir, and I have every faith that you will outdo him.\'

\'I\'ll certainly have to try,\' Harry quipped. 'He's not exactly going to just leave me alone.'

Salazar buffed his nails on his robes. \'Where now, back to your common room?\'

Harry stiffened. \'I said I\'d never go back. I meant it.\'

\'There must be other members of your house who were not involved?\'

\'I'll wait for them to come around,\' Harry replied. \'I won\'t be

returning to Gryffindor Tower any time soon, though.\'

\'Where will you sleep? I enjoy your company, Harry, but it\'s cold down here, even in the study.\'

\'The Room of Requirement, of course.\'

\'Oh, choose their room, why don\'t you,\' Salazar grumbled. \'Some Heir of Slytherin you are.\'

Harry chuckled. \'You\'re going back on the wall, then I\'m going to go get some food. I haven\'t eaten since yesterday lunch and most of that ended up on the floor in here while I was trying to apparate.\'

\'Fine,\' Salazar muttered. \'I want to see you again before the first task, though. I have a few things I should start teaching you. My fields of specialty.\'

\'Blood magic and parsel-magic?\' Harry raised an eyebrow. 'I can't use those in the tournament without provoking a lot of questions and, well, I don't want to follow in Tom Riddle's footsteps if I can avoid it.'

\'It\'s not evil.\' Salazar sighed. \'You still have some preconceptions to lose, I see. If it reassures you, the greatest piece of blood magic I ever created is the parseltongue language you can speak. There\'s no such a thing as parsel-magic. I\'ll explain properly when I actually start teaching you. It'll all make sense then.'\'

Harry hung him back up on the wall over the study's entrance. 'Tournament useful stuff first, I think.'

Salazar shot him a wicked grin. \'If you do well at learning the arts the Heir of Slytherin ought to be paramount at, I\'ll show you how to take the anti-levitation charm off this painting.\'

Harry smiled. 'Well, how could I refuse such boundless

generosity? He left the chamber to the sound of Salazar's echoing laughter.

A still, quiet atmosphere rested over the Great Hall. Grey, autumn clouds drifted across a pale blue sky. Harry took a seat at the end of the Gryffindor table and helped himself to some cold chicken.

*That's very very good.* He moaned under his breath and gulped down the rest of a breast and half a leg.

\'I heard your wand got snapped, Potter.\' Malfoy swaggered up to the table, an ugly sneer on his pale face.

Crabbe and Goyle grunted and cracked their knuckles, looming over either of Malfoy's narrow shoulders.

Harry pulled his best smirk onto his lips. \'I see you took my advice, Malfoy. You should never leave home without your trusty lackeys.\'

\'I haven\'t forgotten that insult, Potter, and now you've no wand

and no friends\...\'

A freckled hand came down on Harry\'s shoulder. \'I wouldn\'t say

that.\'

A second freckled hand came down on his other shoulder. \'He has

just as many friends as you do now, ickle Draco. *Run along*.\'

\'After all the trash you\'ve dragged your name through, you still can\'t get rid of the blood-traitors, it\'s pathetic.\' Malfoy swaggered off, Crabbe and Goyle in tow.

*I don\'t think I\'ve heard them ever actually speak.*

\'So, Harrikins.\' The twins seated themselves either side of him, pushing him further along it. \'We heard you had a run in with some of our fellow Gryffindors.\'

\'We\'re sorry about that, Ginny is too---'

'---but not as sorry as Ron was after our little sister finished with him, George. She hit him with so many hexes he had to go to the hospital wing.'

'He\'s still there, Fred.\'

George.\'

\'It was the first time I\'ve ever seen Snape give points to Gryffindor,

The twins refocused on Harry. \'Anyway, we just dropped by to say

that we\'re working on Angelina and Alicia. It\'s slow, Angelina's still right pissed at you and Alicia's always followed her lead, but Katie\'s helping a lot.\'

*She wants something from me.* Harry's thoughts spilt forth from the well of his mind in a smooth, cool voice. *We\'re friendly, but not that close.*

\'We still have to keep our distance.' George, or possibly Fred, stole a piece of chicken and grinned. \'But not as much as before. Either way, don\'t worry about slime like Malfoy.\'

\'He\'s probably more worried about having to compete in the tournament without a wand, Fred.\'

\'I have a wand. Thank you, though.\'

The pair put their heads together. \'Where did you get a wand from, Harrikins?\'

\'From a wand-maker, of course.\' \'Harrikins is getting smart, George.\' \'We\'d better watch out, Fred.\'

Harry spotted the tall, dark-haired figure of Angelina drifting across the far side of the hall. \'Angelina's coming, so you *had* better watch out.\'

Fred smiled and stuck both his thumbs up, \'Thanks for the

warning.'

\'Decent of you,\' George said. \'This mess with Angelina won\'t last too much longer if we can help it. Gryffindor house will have your back like it's supposed to.\'

Fred leant forward. 'Sorry for the wait, Harrikins, but all's well that ends well.'

# Thirteen Yellow Roses

A foul, grey sky loomed through small lead-edged window panes.

Droplets of rain spotted the glass. The wind plastered a red leaf against the window, then snatched it away again.

*Miserable weather.* Fleur slipped through the weathered, wooden door and cast a quick glance around the room. *As always.*

Krum leant against the wall on the far side of the small room, his thick, dark brows stretched so far down over his eyes, she could barely see them. His robes were ruffled and spattered with mud along the hem.

Karkaroff stood next to his champion, close-mouthed and rigid. One hand curled into his small, silver goatee, the other on his wand. His eyes darted to anyone that strayed too close to him or his charge.

Cedric Diggory, stood in the centre of the floor, rocking back and forth on his heels. His schoolmate weathered the wiles of the reporter, Rita Skeeter. She'd drawn him into the only unoccupied corner, winding her peroxide blond curls round her finger.

*Better him than me. Though she really should be speaking to the champions with a chance of winning*.

The boy's face had set into the sort of effortless, charming smile Fleur normally found herself the target off. He nodded along to whatever the woman was saying, but never offered anything but that bright smile and a few vague words. Rita Skeeter's bright, green quill hovered behind her shoulder, swaying, twirling, and twisting, often dipping toward her notes, but never getting so far as writing anything.

*A Quick-Quotes Quill.* Fleur turned her nose up. *A sure sign of the kind of reporter who likes to give their articles the sort of characteristic*

*flourish that leaves the article\'s subject wondering just how their words have been so completely misrepresented.*

Rita Skeeter's eyes shone with glee, but her quill writhed in

mortal agony.

Fleur spotted the tip of Harry Potter's wand protruding from his sleeve, tucked alongside the inside of his palm. A faint glow emanated from its tip. An equally faint glint of amusement flickered through the boy's eyes.

*Well played, Harry Potter.* Fleur allowed him a fraction of a smile.

*Girls who like to write lies about their betters deserve everything they get.*

\'I think it is time the ceremony began.\' Albus Dumbledore pottered into the centre of the room. \'If you\'d be so kind as to release our youngest champion, Rita.\'

\'Of course, headmaster.\' She slid to the back wall and inspected her notepad. Her face flushed puce and an ugly glimmer boiled in her eyes.

Harry Potter shot Rita Skeeter the same bright, brilliant smile when she glanced at him and her face wrinkled. Foundation smudged into thick lines along her forehead and stained the top of her collar.

\'Let me introduce you all to Mr Garrick Ollivander, Britain\'s finest wand-maker.\' Dumbledore stepped aside.

A tall, thin man with odd, silver eyes floated into the room. \'Ladies first, perhaps,\' he suggested in a quiet, dry voice.

*I intend to be first. As always.* Fleur stepped forward and handed him her wand. *Let's see what this English wandmaker thinks of my wand's core.*

Mr Ollivander turned it over in his long, delicate fingers. \'Nine and a half inches of inflexible rosewood, but with an uncommon core.\' He cast an eye over Fleur.

She tensed. *Here it comes.*

\'Veela hair, I would imagine.' He twirled it in his fingers, glancing between her and her wand with a curious gleam in his silver eyes. \'A beautiful wand, both within and without. You have a strong bond with your partner, Miss Delacour.'

'Thank you,' Fleur murmured.

\'Orchideous.\' Ollivander conjured a bunch of bright yellow roses, then returned Fleur's wand.

The thirteen roses fell to the floor as Fleur retreated to a spot on the wall beside Madame Maxime.

Cedric stepped up past her and passed over his wand.

'Pay attention, Fleur,' Madame Maxime muttered. 'You can learn

lots from a wizard or witch's wand.'

*I know.* Fleur brushed her hair back over her ear and cocked her

head.

\'Ah.\' Ollivander smiled a faint smile. \'I remember this wand.

Twelve and a quarter inches long, ash, and still as springy as when it left my shop. You\'ve kept your wand very well, Mr Diggory.\'

\'I polish it often.'

\'As we all should.\' Ollivander ran a finger along the length of the wand. \'A single hair from a very impressive male unicorn for a core.\' He flicked the wand and a stream of burgundy wine fountained over the floor.

Fleur studied the yellow roses in the puddle of wine and wrinkled her nose. *This wand-maker is beginning to make quite a mess.*

\'Mr Krum?\' Ollivander beckoned the scowling Bulgarian forward with a long finger.

Krum thrust his wand at Ollivander, then stepped back, splashing through the puddle of wine. Crumpled, yellow rose petals stuck to the heels of his boots.

\'Hornbeam, ten and one quarter inches, thicker than one usually sees, and quite rigid.\' Ollivander tested its spring with pursed lips and a hint of a frown. 'Dragon heart-string and an interesting style of alchemy. Familiar to me, though.'

Krum nodded. 'Da.'

\'This is a creation of Gregorovitch. Judging by your age, it must have been one of his last.\'

'Da,\' Krum said. 'His apprentice sold it to me. One of last few left.'

\'A very fine crafter of wands, Mykew Gregorovitch, with a knowledge of wand lore second to none.\' Ollivander swept the hornbeam wand into the air. \'Avis.'

A small flock of white birds adorned with green and red bands across their wings flitted into the rafters of the room, chirping and chattering.

\'Excellent.' Ollivander's eyes came to rest on Harry Potter. \'And Mr Potter.\' A broad set of crooked white teeth gleamed. 'Last but not least.'

The boy slid his wand from his sleeve and passed it into Ollivander\'s long fingers.

Fleur caught a brief frown flitting over Albus Dumbledore's as the

fourteen year old presented his wand.

\'A wand reborn,\' Ollivander whispered, spinning it in his fingers. \'Ebony, eleven inches and a third, in such condition it appears it was only made yesterday.\'

A ghost of a smile passed across the faces of both the boy and Ollivander.

\'Perhaps my finest work,\' Ollivander murmured. \'Certainly the most complex. The shards of the phoenix feather core of your first partner, consumed by basilisk venom. A liquid heart.\'

*The boy's had two wands?!Only aurors and wizards with very dangerous occupations end up having more than one wand these days.* Fleur narrowed her eyes at the boy's smile. *And a liquid core of basilisk venom.... The toxin should've melted the wood.*

Ollivander's smile spread wide. \'A bond that has survived destruction and risen again, stronger than almost any I have seen over the last fifty years.\' He stroked a fingertip down its length as if he were caressing the cheek of his child. \'What has this wand seen?' Ollivander closed his eyes. 'Oh my...'

Ollivander slashed the wand through the air at Harry Potter's

chest.

A twisting, writhing, silver serpent the length of Fleur\'s arm

coalesced and coiled about the boy's shoulders, then faded away.

\'Perfect,\' Ollivander breathed.

Fleur tossed her hair. *Snakes are one of the easiest creatures to*

*conjure, but at least it didn't make any further mess.*

Dumbledore cleared his throat. His blue eyes remained on the boy, small lines creased his brow, but a hint of a smile curved his lips.

Fleur returned to the Great Hall on Harry Potter's heels. *Should I try to speak with him?* The boy slipped away from the group halfway there. *He probably wouldn't have cared anyway.*

Madame Maxime snapped her fingers. \'Come with me, Fleur.\' She strode toward the carriage, glancing around into the nearby rooms and corridors. \'I trust you were paying attention to the ceremony, there was much to be learned about your rivals from it.\'

\'I was.'

\'What did you deduce?\'

\'Cedric Diggory's steadfast, hard-working, and honest, but while he is gifted, he does not seem an exceptionally powerful wizard. Viktor Krum's powerful, stubborn, and unyielding. He will be my fiercest competition.\'

\'And Harry Potter?\'

Fleur studied her fingernails. \'He is unusual. Ollivander seemed to favour him.\'

\'Perceptive as always.\' Madam Maxime stuffed her huge hands into her pockets. \'I believe you are right about Hogwarts\' original champion. Krum, though, has hidden depths, and judging by the spell Ollivander performed, excels in the air.\'

\'He is a quidditch seeker for his country.\'

Madame Maxime nodded. \'Be wary of the Potter boy, Fleur. I have never seen a liquid core wand, nor do I know what it implies about his

magic. However, ebony denotes power and having a basilisk venom core speaks for itself.\'

\'I will be careful of him.'

\'He is unlikely to prove a rival being fourteen,\' Madam Maxime said. \'However, he may provide one or two surprises that could harm your standing against the others.\' She drew Fleur to one side of the path. \'The other champions will soon, if they haven\'t already, be told about the first task. This is to be expected.\'

\'Will I?\' Fleur asked.

\'Of course,\' Madame Maxime exclaimed. \'I am... *stretching* the boundaries a little, but we are going to go get a glimpse of it now. Follow me, Fleur.\'

*Cheating, you mean.* Fleur pursed her lips. *I suppose if everyone*

*else is doing it, I've no choice. I didn't come here to lose.*

Madame Maxime bypassed the carriage and strode into the edge of the woods that bordered the school.

Fleur pulled a face and picked her way through the mud. The heels of her shoes stuck and squelched. She shook her head, then pulled her wand out and transfigured it into firm ground.

Madame Maxime led her on. The trees grew thick around them.

Dark, cracked pines thrust up into a thicket of dead brown branches needles. Brief flashes of green came through holes in the dead layer of the canopy.

*I heard there are all sorts of creatures in here.* Fleur kept her wand in her hand and peered into the shadows. *Acromantula, werewolves, centaurs, giants and worse*. *Perhaps the task is taking place out here?*

A wavering, reddish-orange glow flickered through the pines.

Madame Maxime drew her to one. \'As it is a little unusual for me to take you here, you should cast a disillusionment charm. I know you are adept at the spell.\'

*I wonder how you know?* Fleur cast the spell. *I only told Gabby.*

\'Good.' Madame Maxime closed one eye and gave Fleur a once- over. \'You\'ve improved. Follow me.\'

Waves of hot air billowed past Fleur with the flickering light. They caught her hair and turned the dew on her shoes and calves to steam.

Madame Maxime crunched through dead bracken toward a light gap in the trees and the source of the glow.

The hot wind turned sweltering as Fleur stepped through the tree

line.

Four, massive cages dominated a wide patch of scorched brown

earth dotted with charred tree stumps. White-hot flames billowed from the cages, leaving the bars glowing orange. Dark silhouettes curled behind them.

*Merde.* Fleur tightened her fingers into fists to stop them from shaking. *Dragons. I would've preferred the giant spiders.*

Madame Maxime's shadow vanished round the far side of the

clearing.

*Even my natural resistance to fire will not shield me from dragon*

*fire.* Fleur edged a little closer to the flames. Rivulets of sweat poured off her forehead and down her back. Her uniform stuck to her like a second skin. *I have a sleeping enchantment that ought to work on them, but I'll need to make it a lot stronger to work on something their size*.

A red-scaled, snub-snouted dragon thrashed and spewed fire from the nearest cage, pressing its protuberant eye up between the bars of the cage. A gleaming, viridian green tracked Fleur round the side of the cage as its nostrils flared.

*It seems the tournament is picking back up from where it left things with that murderous cockatrice.*

A shadow coiled in the furthest cage. Black, jagged scales gleamed beneath tattered, ebony wings furled around a serpentine body and a back and tail covered in cruel, curved spines.

*That's a dragon to avoid.*

Its head snapped round and Fleur found herself staring straight into a set of bright, yellow eyes. A wild, furious intelligence glowed in those golden orbs. Molten malevolence glowered out from beneath four, bronze horns. It hissed and lashed its tail through the bars, scoring a deep scar into the ground. Fleur glimpsed a set of barbed spikes as the dragon yanked its tail back through the bars.

*Definitely a dragon to avoid.* She crept back from the glade, keeping well away from the circle of scorched earth and charred leaves.

Madame Maxime stepped out from behind a tree. \'What do you

think?\'

\'I think whoever gets the black one is going to regret putting their

name in the goblet.\' She cocked her head. 'If they survive it, that is.'

\'The Hungarian Horntail. I'm not sure it\'s even tame, from what I was told by Hagrid and his dragon-keeper friend, they had to send a fourth on very short notice.\'

*So it\'s the boy\'s fault that thing is here.* Fleur muttered a few words her mother would've never expected to hear from her. *If I have to face that beast, I'll hex him halfway to death afterward.*

\'Do you have a plan?\' Madame Maxime asked. \'My enchantment, the sleeping one.'

\'The one that makes use of your veela nature. A good plan, but I would have a back up in case they're more resistant to magic than usual. Some higher classes of dragons have been known to be.\'

\'I know to go for the eyes,' Fleur said. \'And I know enough curses and hexes that once I hit it, it will stay blinded.\'

\'Practice.\' Madame Maxime strode toward the carriage. \'Do not mention the dragons, Fleur. I was not really meant to show you, even if the others will all know by the end of the day.\'

Fleur returned to her room and dug out an old school book on magical creatures. 'Dragons have few weaknesses, if faced with one it is best to distract it and flee. If fighting is the only recourse then its weak spots are the eyes and, on some weaker breeds, the softer scaled belly and armpits.'

*That ebony monster is probably not one of the weaker species*.

Fleur shuddered. *It looked like it sprouted straight from one of Gabby\'s old nightmares.*

Fleur snapped the book shut and stacked back in the pile on the

shelf. 'My enchantments will work. As always.'

*The boy will not be likely to survive a tangle with one of those creatures.* A soft pang twisted in Fleur's stomach. *He will probably abandon once his first attempts fail, it's clear he's not really interested in the tournament.*

'I have my own dragon to worry about.' She tugged a sachet of hot chocolate powder out from under a book, twisted the top open, and poured it straight into her mouth. 'Perfect.' She let the warm, rich taste wash over her tongue. 'I wonder if the boy will be able to resist the pull of the magic of my enchantment, too.'

*Probably not. Only very powerful or strong-willed wizards could and my enchantment will be able to put any dragon to sleep.* Malevolent yellow eyes and a bone-barbed tail flashed through her mind. *Well, any dragon but that awful horntail.*

# Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus

Harry huffed a line of dust off the shelf of books beside the ladder. Odd, dust-free shelves scattered the circular library beyond the desk and a circle of his footprints ringed its wood floor.

Salazar pulled his snake away from over his eyes and yawned. \'It\'s today?\'

\'Yes.'

\'I told you to come see beforehand so I could teach you things!\' Salazar exploded into parseltongue, muttering curses so fast Harry's ears couldn't pick them out.

\'I did. I\'m right here.\'

\'I can\'t teach you right before the task begins. You\'ll need your strength for the competition and blood magic is a demanding field.\' The snake slithered around Salazar\'s neck and settled on his right shoulder.

\'You can\'t even teach me about the theory?\' Harry asked \'There\'s not much point, is there? Magic is best learnt practically

and actively, not listening to a painting.\'

Harry shoved Secrets of the Darkest Arts to one side and sat on

the edge of the desk. 'Well, we've got a little bit of time.'

\'What is the task?\' Salazar asked.

\'I have no idea.\' Harry shrugged. \'I think it\'s probably meant to be a surprise.\'

\'Where is your cunning?\' Salazar threw his hands in the air, dislodging his snake. It let out a disgruntled hiss and slithered up his leg

back to its perch. \'What kind of Heir of Slytherin are you? You should have gone and found out.\'

\'From where?\' Harry asked. \'The big book of future tournament

tasks?\'

Salazar sniggered and pointed at the desk behind him.

Harry swivelled. A new, clean piece of parchment sat right on top

of a stack of books, weighed down by a crystal vial.

He sighed. \'The big book of future tournament tasks...'

\'You left that just before you arrived, said I\'d understand in a short

while.\'

\'I used the time-turner, didn\'t I?\' Harry turned to look at the desk

only to find the golden necklace gone. \'Where am I?\'

\'You said you were going to practice occlumency exercises,\' Salazar replied. \'Read the rest aloud for me.\'

\'Dragons. Distractions work best. Don\'t ignore Katie.\'

*Bloody hell. Dragons.* Harry's heart hammered against his ribs and

his breath caught in his throat. *And I thought baby Norbert was bad.*

\'Dragons.\' Salazar stroked his chin. \'Could be worse.\'

Harry wiped the sweat off his palms. \'Dragons seem pretty bad.'

\'Could be worse, could be another basilisk. A dragon normally attacks by breathing fire, which they can only do in one direction. That's fairly easy to see coming. The stare of the king of serpents is much more subtle and deadly.\'

\'If I\'m hit by the fire. It really won\'t matter.\'

\'You survived to warn yourself,\' Salazar said. \'The plan must have worked and now you know it, because you will have done it, succeeded, and told yourself.\'

Harry blinked. \'Run that by me once more.\'

Salazar sighed. \'You left yourself a message telling you how to do the task after completing it. Just trust yourself and go with it.\' He peered over Harry and frowned. \'What else does it say?\'

\'The small one bites.'

\'I have no idea what you were trying to tell yourself. I hope it wasn\'t important.\'

\'I can\'t imagine leaving myself an ambiguous note if it didn\'t need to be ambiguous,\' Harry said. \'Know anything about dragons?\'

\'I am *Salazar Slytherin*.'

\'You only ever say that when you don\'t know,\' Harry muttered. \'I wasn\'t stupid enough to ever pick a fight with one,\' Salazar

snapped. \'Avoid the fire, the claws, and the teeth. Their senses of smell and hearing are good, but not amazing, so once it\'s blind you can remain undetected if you're careful.\'

\'Some of that actually sounded useful.' \'I hope the dragon gets you.'

\'So do a lot of people, I reckon.\' Harry bounced his wand on his palm. \'I\'ll have a think about what to do on the way there. The rupturing curse should work on the eyes.\'

\'A bit cruel,\' Salazar said. \'But if it's that or be turned into a small pile of ash...\'

\'I know.' Harry sighed. 'But if it works...\'

\'I suggest you try and use simple spells to find an elegant, easy solution,\' Salazar said. \'Keeping your potential a secret is generally a good idea if you don\'t want to suddenly make a lot of powerful wizards and witches feel threatened.\'

\'An easy distraction and the rupturing curse, then,\' Harry said. 'No

conjuring basilisks out of dragon fire.'

\'If the simple stuff fails, don\'t hold back. Better to have potential enemies and be alive, than to be eaten by a dragon.\'

*A new motto for House Slytherin*.

\'You don\'t seem very worried about your last living family

member,' Harry quipped.

\'I know you survive. You\'re sitting in the pipes somewhere out there, after all.\'

\'I suppose.' Harry turned it over in his head. 'I guess the version of me to first undertake the task must've made such a mess of things he'd no option but to resort to this. That version of me won't exist if the note changes things and so long as I remember to leave the note afterward myself, then the loop will close. Right?'

Salazar smirked. 'Probably. There's also a chance you make an

even worse mess of things and have to do it all again.' 'Maybe it's best to just not think about it.'

\'You should go,\' Salazar said. \'Don\'t want to be late and miss watching the other champions try and avoid being toasted. You might pick up something useful from them.\'

Harry hurried out.

*Awful things happen to wizards who mess with time, Harry.* Hermione's voice echoed up from only a few months ago. He crushed it down. *I'm not listening to you anymore.*

A large white tent surrounded by reporters and teachers squatted before a very Romanesque arena.

*Best not to risk Rita Skeeter a second time.* Harry slipped round the back of the group and in through the side of the tent.

Cedric's pale face jerked up to Harry. Krum brooded at one of the tent poles and the French witch leant against another as if she was waiting for someone to bring her a drink. Harry imagined that drink would be sweet, expensive, and probably had a fancy French name his aunt would completely mangle.

*Should I warn them about the dragons?* He glanced at Cedric. *No.*

*They wouldn't have warned me, would they?*

\'You\'re all here,\' Bagman boomed.

A stern Mr Crouch hobbled in after him, Percy Weasley on his

heels.

\'Stick your hand in the bag to draw out your opponent,\' Mr Crouch

ordered. \'Your task will be to retrieve the golden egg from whichever creature you draw.\'

*And there I was at the World cup thinking I would never be stupid enough to try and steal an egg from a dragon. Jokes on me, I guess.*

\'You first, Mr Diggory.\' Bagman clapped Cedric on the back. \'Home team has to set an example.\'

Cedric closed his eyes and dipped his hand into the bag. It came out clutching a short-faced, silvery-blue dragon that twisted and hissed in his palm.

*He doesn't look very surprised to see a dragon.* Harry sensed foul play. *Well, now I'm glad I didn't warn you.*

Bagman gave Cedric a thumbs up and a huge grin. \'And you, Mr

Krum.\'

Krum stomped across and snatched a red, bulging-eyed creature

from the bag. It prowled along the length of his palm, snorting small bursts of fire and stretching its bright crimson wings.

\'Miss Delacour.\'

*So that\'s her name.*

The Delacour girl's face was pale as Aunt Petunia's precious pond lilies. Her fist came out clutching a green-brown dragon. She released a long sigh and the colour returned to her cheeks. The model dragon in her hand curled up and closed its eyes.

Percy turned and thrust the bag at Harry. \'Potter.'

Harry met his stare with Tom Riddle's bright smile. Percy Weasley glanced away. Harry reached into the bag. His fingers met something warm and small. It wriggled. He drew it out of the bag to have a look.

The model was as black as his wand, covered in jagged scales and spines, serpentine, and furious. Harry watched it writhe along his palm, spitting small plumes of fire in every direction.

\'So Mr Diggory gets the Swedish Short-Snout, Mr Krum the Chinese Fireball, Miss Delacour the Welsh Green, and Mr Potter has the Hungarian Horntail.\' Bagman bounced on his feet. 'How exciting!'

\'We'll proceed in that order,\' Mr Crouch rasped. \'At the sound of the cannon you need only go through the entrance and the task will have begun.\'

A dull boom echoed through the tent.

\'I guess that means you\'re out of preparation time, Cedric,\' Bagman called. \'Go show them why Hogwarts has won this tournament the most times.\'

Cedric shot the man a fiery look, then hurried out through the tent entrance. Ludo Bagman, Mr Crouch, and Percy Weasley slipped out through the side of the tent.

Harry eyed the dragon on his palm, noting the barbed tail. The tiny dragon stared back; its yellow eyes bored into Harry's, then it twisted round and seized the tip of his finger between its jaws.

'Bloody hell.' Harry flicked it in the head until it let go.

*The small one bites.*

The crowd roared from the arena and the enraged bellow of a dragon echoed through the tent.

\'It seems a bit unfair we can\'t watch as well,\' Harry muttered.

Krum chuckled. \'It would not be fair. Whomever went first would have a disadvantage.\'

'True.'

The cannon boomed and Krum straightened up. He discarded his model, gave Harry and the French witch a nod, and vanished.

*I hope he survives. He seems like a decent guy under all that scowling.*

\'Are you not nervous?\' The French witch took a step toward him.

'This is not a tournament for the average wizard or witch.'

Harry raised an eyebrow at her.

\'I\'ve seen that dragon close up when it was caged. I didn\'t want to be near it then. I certainly don\'t now.\'

*Krum probably knew as well. Bunch of cheats.* Harry frowned as a little flare of ambition rose inside his chest. *Great. Now I'm starting to want to actually beat them.*

\'They\'re all pretty dangerous,\' he said. 'They *are* dragons.'

\'You are fourteen, Harry.\' She tossed her silver hair over her shoulder. A strange little gleam appeared in her blue eyes. \'There is no way you could've learnt as much magic as us. We are the best of our schools.\'

\'I have no choice but to compete. Why fear something if fearing it will not help? I've never been all that great at being afraid, either. It just doesn't seem to happen to me much anymore.\' He searched his mind for her first name. \'I\'m afraid I don\'t know your name.'

*\'Fleur Delacour*.\' Her blue eyes narrowed. \'I will let you read it off

the Triwizard Cup at the end, if you're still alive.\'

*Well, that seems like the end of that little chat.*

The cannon thundered.

Fleur Delacour shot him a heated look and stalked out.

*I feel sorry for the dragon.If it's anything like its model, it probably just wants to sleep. Now it's going to get more angry French witch than anyone deserves.*

He let out a long sigh. 'At least it's nice and quiet.'

The long silence stretched on and on.

'Maybe she got eaten.' Harry bounced his model dragon on his palm until it hissed. 'She's probably already won, though, so she'll be even more confident.'

The cannon boomed.

Harry flinched. The small dragon lashed out with its tail and stabbed him in the palm.

*Infernal creature. If the real one is as bad as this one, I\'m not going to enjoy this at all.* He eyed the model and smirked as he strode to the exit. *Yes. I think you\'ll be coming with me*.

The tent opened into a short, rocky passageway. Harry followed it, hiding the hand he was holding the model horntail in and slipping his wand out of his sleeve.

A golden egg nestled on top of a clutch of large, dark dragon eggs. Bare rock stretched up to where the stands of the arena rose.

*Shouldn't there be an angry, fire-breathing reptile?*

Harry glanced around the arena and took aim at one of the rocks. \'Reducto.\'

It burst into sand.

A searing column of flame engulfed the innocent stone.

The dragon reared up from behind the rocks and spread its tattered wings over its nest. It scraped its tail across the rocks, producing a screech so loud it stung Harry's ears.

*Let's hope this works.* Harry hurled the model dragon to the far side of the arena and took careful aim with his wand. *It's going to take a lot of magic to make this small thing as big as the real dragon.*

\'Engorgio.'

The model swelled up to match the original dragon and roared.

The Hungarian Horntail whirled round and echoed the plastic

model's challenge. The crowd cheered.

\'Confractio,\' Harry whispered, aiming his rupturing curse for the

real dragon's eyes.

His first two attempts sailed between the dragon's as they squared up, his third deflected off the real dragon\'s jaw, but his fourth struck true and blinded the creature on his side.

The horntail screamed and shook its head, spattering the ground with drops of steaming blood. It swung its tail round in a vicious arc, obliterating a small outcrop of rocks. Fragments of stone tore holes through the model's plastic skin.

The model lunged, grappling with the original, and the two dragons crashed to the ground on the far side of the arena.

Harry crept toward the nest.

The model pinned the actual dragon beneath it, driving its tail through the tattered, leathery wing of its attacker. The original seemed

dazed, but the model\'s claws and teeth weren't leaving so much as

scratches on the hard ebony scales of its throat and belly.

*The moment it breathes fire, that model and then me, are going to be in trouble.* He snuck toward the eggs, watching the tail of the downed dragon scrape across the ground by the nest.

The real horntail curled its tail back on itself and impaled the model, then threw it away.

*Now or never.* Harry darted for the golden egg. The horntail unleashed a wave of white flames. The model melted to ash.

*That'll teach it to bite me.* Harry felt the horntail's yellow eyes

focus on the nape of his neck. *Oh, bloody hell.* He grabbed the egg and ran.

The crowd gasped.

The barbed tail of the Hungarian Horntail slammed into the rocks beside him. Sharp pieces of rock sprayed past him, slicing lines of fire across his face, arm, and thigh.

Harry dived behind a large rock. Blistering heat descended on him.

He hunched in and closed his eyes until the fire faded.

'Okay.' Harry stepped round the rock and met the furious glare of the sole yellow eye. 'No more simple stuff, it's fire basilisk time.'

Red magic streaked down from above. The horntail wobbled and thudded to the ground.

*That's lucky.* Harry bounced his golden egg in the crook of his arm and followed Mr Crouch's arm toward the other white tent. *Whatever's in this egg better be worth it.*

Cedric lay on one bed. Bandages swaddled one side of his body. A thick, light blue liquid soaked them in patches; it smelt strongly of mint and steamed in the low light of the tent. A few scattered patches of pink marred Krum's face and arms and his robes bore a few scorch marks and holes. The French witch leant against one of the poles.

*Not so much as a speck of ash on her. How annoying.*

Harry gave them a wave. \'Nobody died, then!\' \'It was touch and go,\' Cedric replied.

Krum laughed. Fleur Delacour's blue eyes cut through him, sweet and sharp as Petunia's Japanese kitchen knives slicing through his skin.

\'They will be doing your score,\' Krum said. \'You should go look.\' Harry gave him a nod and stepped outside.

Five judges sat in an elevated box overlooking the arena. Madam Maxime, the French headmistress, raised her wand and shot an eight into the air. A nine rose from Professor Dumbledore's and a seven from the Durmstrang headmaster, Karkaroff.

\'Bagman gave you a ten and Crouch gave you an eight.\' Katie Bell edged round the corner of the tent.

*She really wants something from me.* He turned away. *The*

*note...*

Harry took a deep breath and turned back around. \'Thanks.

What're they out of?\'

\'Ten, of course.\' She beamed. \'You did *really* well, Harry. I'm not sure, but I think they only took points off because you stopped to watch the dragons fight and took a little longer than the Beauxbatons champion.\'

\'What did she do?\'

\'She sang something and then the dragon and every male in the audience fell asleep, even Professor Dumbledore yawned. The judges all gave her nines except Karkaroff. He gave her an eight.\' Katie scrunched her face up. \'All the guys seem to go weird around her. Except you, that is.\'

\'And the others?\'

*Fleur Delacour won this round, so I should lose graciously.* He wrestled with a tight knot and the memory of those blue eyes piercing through him. *But I'm going to win the next one.*

\'Cedric did the worst. He transfigured a distraction and went for the egg, but the dragon got him with its wing and tail. You and Krum are equal. He blinded his dragon and collected the egg after it had flailed somewhere out the way, but lots of the eggs got smashed.\'

Katie gave him a once over. \'You didn\'t get anything more than scratches, did you?\'

\'Nope.'

\'That\'s impressive. Angelina was really impressed too, you know.\' A shard of ice tightened in Harry's chest. \'I don\'t care what

Angelina thinks.'

Katie shuffled her feet. \'She\'ll come to apologise soon. Like I have.\' She gave him a rueful grin.

\'Fred and George told me you tried to convince her to stop holding a grudge.\'

\'I did, but I still didn\'t speak to you.\'

\'You are now.'

\'I guess I am. I was afraid you\'d just ignore me. I think I would've been quite angry if you\'d done that. *Hermione* has been telling everyone how you\'ve changed and won\'t forgive anyone. She\'s stopped a lot of people apologising.\'

\'I won\'t forgive them,\' Harry said. \'But I won\'t hold a grudge or

anything, I just know I can't trust them next time.'

\'And Angelina?\' Katie asked.

\'She was the worst in the beginning. Don't think I don't know *why*

everyone turned against me.'

\'She was really angry,' Katie murmured. \'We all told her that she would get it and she got convinced, then everything happened and things got out of hand. I know you don\'t owe me anything, but would you consider giving her a second chance, if not for me, for the quidditch team. Gryffindor needs its seeker.\'

\'I\'ll listen to her if she comes to me, but that\'s all.\'

\'Thanks, Harry.\' Katie stepped forward and wrapped her arms round him.

He stiffened, but she only tightened her hold.

*I guess I should hug her back*. He folded his arms around her. \'That was nice.\' Katie smiled. \'You\'re taller than you used to be.\' \'I noticed.\' He looked down his nose at her and grinned.

She shot him a mock glare and a wave as she wandered back towards the arena.

*How did she even find her way up here?* Harry glanced round. *You*

*can't see me here, so she must've waited. That was nice of her.*

\'Mr Potter.' Madam Pomfrey's heels echoed down the gap between the tents.

*Uh oh.*

Madam Pomfrey wielded her wand in one hand and a bottle full of thick, sludge-like brown potion in the other. \'I do not remember telling you that you could leave my medical tent, Mr Potter.'

\'You didn\'t say I had to stay either.'

\'In.\' Madam Pomfrey stabbed her wand at the tent. *'Now*.'

*Some battles just can't be won.* Harry hustled back through into the tent. *I had better odds against the dragon.*

\'What did you get?\' Krum asked.

*Evidently nobody else has been told they can leave, either.*

\'Forty two points and a very stern lecture from Madam Pomfrey,\' Harry said.

\'You have the same score as me.\' Krum nodded, a faint gleam appearing in his eyes. \'Well done. I did not expect it, but it is good to have competition.\'

\'I did the worst.\' Cedric peeled some of his bandages off, revealing fresh, hairless, pink skin.

Fleur Delacour's stare drilled into him. \'Forty *four*.'

Cedric grimaced. \'Are you sure you don\'t want to be Hogwarts\' champion, Harry? You got eight more points than I did.\'

\'It\'s just the first task.\' Harry met Fleur Delacour's stare with a flat

look.

She flipped her silver hair over her shoulder and turned away. Madam Pomfrey bustled back into the tent. \'Drink this, Mr Potter.' Harry eyed the brown gloop. \'But I barely even got a scratch...\'

She thrust the bottle into his hands. \'When you\'ve drunk it, you

can all leave, Mr Potter.'

Harry groaned, then pinched his nose and gulped it down.

Aniseed flooded his mouth and stung his nose. His eyes watered and he suppressed a gag. 'That was awful.'

\'Go on, then.\' Madam Pomfrey plucked the bottle out of his hands. \'You\'d think you\'d be more grateful after spending so much time in my care every year, Mr Potter.\'

Fleur Delacour and Krum drifted away toward the carriage and

the ship.

\'I want to sleep for a week,\' Cedric said as they headed toward

Hogwarts.

\'We\'re excused from lessons, go ahead.\' Harry grinned and tucked the egg under his arm. \'I think I\'m going to go lie down for a bit as well.\'

*Occlumency exercises*. Harry snorted. *I\'m going to use the time- turner to leave that note, then find a nice, wide point in the pipes and transfigure something into a bed.*

# Blood Magic

Harry crumpled up the piece of parchment entitled *The Big Book of Future Tournament Tasks* and lit it on fire with his wand. 'Best there's no evidence.'

'Nobody else can see it, it's down here.' 'Fawkes got down here.'

Salazar rolled his eyes. 'I'll explain when you know more magic.' He reeled his serpent in and coiled it round his arm. 'Did you ever deduce the meaning of the message you just burnt?'

\'I can guess.'

\'Did you guess?\'

\'There were dragons, the tiny model dragon that was used to select them bit me, and Katie Bell, one of my Gryffindor house-mates approached me after the match.\'

\'The small one bites.\' Salazar cackled. \'Why so ambiguous?\'

\'If I'd been forewarned too specifically the model would not have had the chance to bite me and I would not have been motivated to take it into the arena with me.\' Harry shrugged. 'If I hadn\'t told myself at all, I probably would've ignored it and missed how useful it ended up being. It had to be just right.\'

\'Very astute of you. It explains why you were grinning to yourself when you wrote the note, too.\'

\'I\'ve never played a prank on myself from the future before,\' Harry said. \'I found the concept quite entertaining.\'

\'So did Godric,' Salazar muttered. \'Only he didn\'t have the decency

to carry out his childish activities on himself.\'

\'What about this Katie Bell?\' Salazar asked. 'You've never

mentioned her before.'

\'I think she'd've been angry with me if I'd ignored her like I nearly

did.'

\'Important, is she?\'

Harry shrugged. 'She\'s a friend, I suppose. A teammate, really, but

she stuck by me and tried to help.\'

\'Don\'t want her changing her mind and undoing everything she

did.\' Salazar nodded. 'An equal, maybe?'

The snake mimicked the motion and stuck its tongue out

alongside the inside of Salazar's palm.

Salazar fidgeted, itching at his palm. 'Wretched reptile. I wish I'd decided to make you part of the design of the frame of this painting instead of putting you in here with me. You can't even *talk!'*

'Why not?'

'The snake has to be smart enough. While I enchanted the painting to be a sort of copy of myself, this useless scaly worm is just paint and canvas charmed to act like a snake.' Salazar unwound it off his arm and draped it over his shoulders. 'Grab that book off the shelves behind you.'

Harry stared at the hundred or so books on the shelf. 'Which book? The small one?' He squinted at the title. '*A Thousand and One Snake Puns?'*

Salazar coughed and turned a little pink in the face. 'Not that one.

*My* one. *Writing in the Elixir of Life.*'

library.'

Harry ran his finger along the titles. 'This is the biggest book in the

'Second biggest.' Salazar pointed his wand into the far corner.

'Rowena wrote a treatise called *Arithmantic Principles in Potions* that's an extra ten thousand words longer.'

'Well, I'm not reading that.'

Salazar chuckled. 'I didn't either. Rowena knows her stuff, but her

writing was always very matter-of-fact and dry.'

'Not like Salazar Slytherin's bestseller, *A Thousand and One Snake Puns.* Don't think I didn't see the name of the author.*'* Harry caught a fair few choice words in parseltongue as he dragged the ancient, leather- covered, heavy tome.

'Just take me and the books outside.'

Harry levitated a stack of tomes off the desk and lifted the portrait off the wall to carry Salazar out into the main chamber.

\'Now I can finally teach you about the things I was exceptional at!' Salazar's wand spurted silver and green sparks over the head of his serpent. 'Naturally, as my heir, you'll be exceptional at them, too.'

'Naturally...' Harry leant the portrait against the foot of one of the

serpent effigies and took a seat on the floor in front of the painting. 'So?'

\'Where to begin?\' Salazar muttered, rubbing his palms together.

'Where to begin?'

\'The basics?\' Harry suggested.

Salazar's face fell. \'Fine.\' He sighed. \'It will take an age to get to the exciting things, but I suppose it\'s better than you accidentally destroying the chamber... or yourself.'

it?'

Harry groaned. 'This is going to be a really dry conversation, isn't

'Blood magic is any magic that uses blood as a medium or tether,

but due to its potency and complexity, it's mostly just used for sacrificial and ritual magic,\' Salazar said. \'The only real rule for sacrificial magic, is that whatever you sacrifice must be equal to whatever you are trying to achieve.\'

\'That\'s it?\'

\'Of course that isn\'t it! Sacrificial magic is a very subtle, delicate thing. It requires a full, true understanding of magic and self. You cannot really sacrifice something when you do not know its value, nor can you attain a result you do not already understand the implications of.\'

\'What can I actually do with it?\'

\'Anything and everything,\' Salazar said. \'Parselmagic, the magic at the root of parseltongue, is merely an example of complex blood magic, that is to say sacrificial magic in which blood was used as a medium and as the anchor of the magic. This chamber, the thoughts of sufficiently intelligent serpents, and our magic, are all bound to the blood that flows in my veins and thus in yours. It's perhaps my finest creation. The ability to speak to animals was once more common and applied to more than just snakes, but over time it was lost. The last witch recorded as being capable of speaking to animals died half a millennia before I was born. I attempted, originally through other means, but eventually through blood magic, to recreate part of what was lost. I was not prepared to sacrifice anything more than I did, so my piece of magic only responds to serpents as they are easily summoned.\'

\'What did you have to sacrifice?\'

\'Something that was of equal value to me. *Someone*, to be

precise.\'

*Someone?!* Harry felt ice form in his veins.

He stared at the painting, cold horror curdling in his gut. \'You sacrificed *a person!?'*

\'She was dying already. We sacrificed the little time we had left together, much as it meant to us, to create something that would aid and set apart our children and their descendants for as long as they survived.\'

\'Sorry. I should've known better than to assume.\'

\'Yes you should have,' Salazar snapped. \'You do not understand the magnitude of the sacrifice. Even I didn't until after I'd done it. My daughter and I searched for many years for an artefact rumoured to be able to cheat the laws of death and enable us to speak with her again. I never found it. I became too old to hunt for it and was forced to give up, but my daughter had not before I died. It is possible she was successful, but I would not know either way. That sacrifice defined the rest of the lives of myself and my daughter in one way, then the rest of our descendants in another. If you take anything from that, let it be the realisation of the kind of effect blood magic can have on your life.\'

\'How does it work?\' Harry asked.

\'Blood is the most potent magical medium --- personal and puissant. Blood magic makes use of it as a conduit through which to perform otherwise impossible feats.\'

*Something impossible?*

Harry traced a finger down his scar. \'Like surviving the Killing Curse, perhaps?\'

\'There are very few pieces of magic capable of achieving that.' Salazar stroked his chin. \'The Killing Curse is not a simple spell. It is a derivation of one of the only other fields as powerful and complex. Blood

magic could be used, but it would come at the cost of the caster\'s life, or more, rendering the protection irrelevant.\'

\'But you could cast it to protect someone who shared your blood?\' \'Perhaps\... It would not be easy, but it's a fascinating idea. I think

to make a whole bloodline immune to such a powerful curse would cost

more than anyone has to give.\'

\'I survived it,\' Harry said. \'When I was a baby, Voldemort came to kill me. He managed to murder my parents, but his intended final victim reflected his curse back onto him.\'

\'That could well be blood magic,\' Salazar said. 'Perhaps they only afforded *you* that protection. It would reduce the sacrifice to a level that would be possible to make, though it would have still been very dear indeed.\'

'They did die.'

Salazar's brow creased and he stroked the head of the snake that curled around his shoulders. 'I would guess they carried out a blood magic based piece of sacrificial magic that would come into effect should they both die to keep you safe. Your safety from this attacker would be the goal and it would certainly constitute a sacrifice dear enough to protect you.\'

\'It lasted at least as long until I was eleven,\' Harry replied. \'When Voldemort tried to harm me in my first year here, he burnt at my touch.\'

\'It may still be in effect now. Your parents sacrificed their lives and every moment they would have spent with their child, there is little of greater value to a parent.\'

\'I\'d rather not need it.'

\'You will not,\' Salazar said. 'But it is a powerful advantage while it lasts. The magic will protect you in any way it can as long as it lingers in your blood. Still, it goes without saying that you should avoid lethal spells, especially the Killing Curse.\'

\'Why especially? Dead is dead.\'

\'Most lethal spells are really no different from other curses in that they just cause something to affect you. In the case of most lethal spells the effect is what truly kills you and effects like that can usually be prevented in numerous ways. The Killing Curse is derived from soul magic. It literally tears your soul from your body. The curse kills you outright rather than causing or creating something to do so.\'

\'Soul magic?\'

\'Not something I ever more than dabbled in the practice of. It's the equal of blood magic in some ways, but far more abstract in its concept and very dangerous because of it. I know of few uses for soul magic worth their cost. The Killing Curse is one of the few soul magic spells that has no *permanent* effect. Using it causes the soul to fracture, but over time, in the right conditions, a soul can heal. If you are interested, there is a very old Egyptian book in my study. It\'s hardly a guide to the field, but the wizard referenced in it, Seth, is attributed with the first use of the Killing Curse. He was likely its creator.\'

\'The name sounds familiar.'

\'You might have heard it in the muggle world. The muggles of Egypt used to us that name for their God of murder. Whether there\'s a connection is unclear.\'

*All things considered, it seems likely.*

\'Did you bring all the other books I recommended to you before?\' Salazar asked.

\'Yes.\' Harry named them one after the other, descending down the

stack. 'See?'

\'The Secrets of the Darkest Arts?\'

\'I didn\'t mean to bring that.\' Harry stared at the weathered book and the sheafs of parchment wedged within the pages. \'I must've stacked the other books on top of it in the study.\'

\'It probably has something useful in it. Blood magic is powerful magic and powerful magic has always been used in questionable ways. The element of sacrifice doesn\'t help its reputation any.\'

Harry studied the neat, flowing script on the parchment that stuck out of its pages. *Riddle's handwriting.*

\'I\'ll read it last,\' he said.

\'Take them to the Room of Requirement after this tournament meeting you have to attend,\' Salazar suggested. \'Just make sure you aren\'t seen reading them and bring them back to the study afterward. Most of those books were old and valuable when I acquired them; they\'ll be worth a fortune now.\'

Harry cast a quick time-checking spell only to find that it would soon be time for the meeting. *How does he even know what the time is?*

\'There\'s nothing else I can teach you until you\'ve read those and understood the two principles of blood magic and their applications. It isn\'t a pure subject like transfiguration, but it can be used to augment or create wards, enchantments, and many other such areas.\'

Salazar groaned and screwed up his face. \'I just quoted *Godric*. He used to go on and on about how blood magic wasn\'t really a field in its own right. Oh I bet he's giggling away in the afterlife right now, the overgrown child.\'

Harry carried the portrait back, shrank the books and stashed them in his pocket, then swiped his golden egg off the study desk.

Salazar's grumbling followed him all the way up the stairs to Myrtle's bathroom.

*He's probably still going now.* Harry hurried toward the classroom for his tournament meeting. *As long as he's not still going when I get back.*

\'All our champions are here!\' Bagman swung his legs off the edge of a desk, the black and yellow robes of his old beater's shirt drawing tight over his belly.

Mr Crouch frowned and tapped his pocket watch. \'The first task is over. You have each obtained the golden egg your dragons were guarding and achieved a score for your methods.\'

\'Some of which were spectacular.\' Bagman stuck both his thumbs up at Harry and grinned.

\'The egg is your clue for the second task.' Mr Crouch paid Bagman

no heed. 'Solve it.\'

Harry examined his egg, turning it over in his hands. *I\'ll have to try*

*opening it. It's an egg, so it makes sense the clue would be inside*.

Cedric bounced his egg in his hands and Fleur ran her wand tip over hers.

Krum scowled and gave his a shake. 'Well, it does not rattle, so at least it's not more broom polish.'

Harry snorted. 'If it sprouts wings and flies off, you can borrow my

Firebolt.'

Krum grinned and gave Harry a sharp-eyed once over. 'You have

Firebolt? Seeker, yes?'

\'Well, unless any of you have questions this meeting is concluded.\' Mr Crouch slipped his pocket watch back away and strode toward the door.

\'Harry.\' Bagman caught his arm at the door. \'If you want a hand with the egg just give me a shout,\' he whispered. He walked away with a wink.

Crouch cut him off with a stern expression and the two held a furious, muttered argument on one side of the corridor.

Harry cradled his egg beneath his arm and set off in the direction of the Room of Requirement.

'Hey Harry.' Ginny sidled into his path. \'Ginny...\'

'Er...'

\'You stopped me,\' he said.

\'I know.\' She flushed. \'I wanted to say sorry.\'

\'A lot of people have been from what I\'ve heard.\'

\'A lot of people didn\'t want to try and stand up to Angelina and all the seventh and sixth years.\' Ginny squirmed. 'Sorry.'

\'Angelina's having a change of heart, apparently.'

Ginny's eyes narrowed and her jaw tightened. \'Katie said that, did

she?\'

Harry raised an eyebrow. \'She did.'

\'I didn\'t turn my back on you. I just didn\'t want to suddenly act all close with you, because --- well, because I was afraid you\'d think I was just trying to get close to you.\'

\'You should have done. I probably would've noticed, but I

wouldn\'t have minded all that much.\'

\'It\'s too late, isn\'t it.'

\'Sorry. If it helps, I\'ll accept your apology.\'

She smiled. \'I\'d like that. I was hoping to be someone better this year, not just Ron\'s little sister who got into trouble and needed rescuing.\'

\'You succeeded.' Harry shot her a grin. \'I haven\'t seen you stick your elbow in a butter dish in years.\'

Ginny went bright red and covered her face with her hand. \'Oh no.

You saw that.'

\'I tried not to laugh.\' He let the smile slide off his face. \'I\'m not the same boy who rushed down to the Chamber of Secrets after a basilisk to save you anymore, Ginny.\'

*I never was.*

\'Hermione said you\'d changed.\'

\'She\'s right.' A little ice crept into his tone. She winced. \'Touchy subject.'

\'You wouldn't be fond of someone who broke your wand, either. I

heard what happened to Ron.\'

\'He was being an idiot.\' Ginny scowled. \'He still is.\'

\'Still?\'

*I've not seen him for a while, actually.*

She shook her head, sending her long red ponytail swaying behind her. \'He and Hermione have some ridiculous theory that something happened to you at the World Cup. They think you were hit by some dark curse and that it affected you in the head.\'

Harry laughed. \'Does anyone actually believe that?\'

\'Seamus and Dean, but a lot of the house is just sick of the whole thing now. Most are just avoiding anyone involved or waiting to see who turns out to be right. Neville still hangs around Ron and everyone, but it\'s because he hasn\'t got the courage to go make other friends.\'

Harry smiled. *Now the shoe's on the other foot. Serves them right.*

\'They *do* deserve it.'

The Great Hall started to fill with people as lunch drew near and Harry began to shift restlessly from on foot to the other. 'Was there something else?'

Ginny shuffled her feet. \'I was hoping you\'d come eat lunch with

us.'

'Us?\' Harry frowned. 'A lot of your friends might not be so keen

about that.'

\'Me, the twins, a few others.' Her lips thinned. 'Katie will be there.'

\'I have to go play with this thing.\' Harry tapped the top of his golden egg.

A clear, ringing sound came from his clue.

\'I see.' Ginny's brow wrinkled and she sighed. 'Well, I hope the second task goes as well as the first.'

*It has to go better. I'm not going to beat Krum or that French girl if it doesn't.*

Harry slipped through the Great Hall and made his way up to the seventh floor and the hidden room opposite the tapestry of tap dancing trolls.

*I need somewhere to solve the clue of the egg.* He focused on his desire and waited until a door appeared.

A simple, plain room lay beyond. The carved half-fish, half-human forms of some creatures wielding tridents swam in excited shoals over a stone bench, scattering when he approached to sit. A small bubbling pool commanded the room's centre.

*Not quite what I expected.* Harry glanced round the room and down into the clear water. *Clearly this room has some nuances I've not quite grasped.*

He sat down and turned the egg over in his hands, looking for a catch or clasp. Harry tapped it with his wand, and it split in half.

A piercing shriek tore through the air.

Harry slammed the egg shut. *Some clue that is!*

He took a deep breath. 'Stupid egg. I hate loud noises, *especially*

unexpected ones.'

The mermaids on the bench gestured at him, waving their tridents in the air.

*Blood magic first. It's ages until the next task.* Harry dropped the egg on the floor and swung his foot at it.

The egg rolled across the floor and teetered on the edge of the bubbling pool. Harry ignored it and pulled out his stack of books.

# One Flew over the Owlery

Condensation blurred the grey sky through the window, it trickled down the glass, over the white painted window sill, then dripped down onto the blue carpet. The cold seeped in from outside creeping through the panes like dusk shadows from the dark pines at the castle's edge.

Fleur swirled her mug and cast another warming charm. Steam rose from the damp patch beneath the window. *The more it hurts to have, the more satisfying it'll be to get it.* She dropped another sugar cube into her hot chocolate and watched it melt away. *And I will win.*

A heavy hand pounded at her door.

Fleur grimaced, tossed her blanket onto the bed, and picked her

wand up. 'Who is it?'

\'I would like to discuss the first task with you, Fleur.' Madame Maxime's low voice echoed through the door.

Fleur pulled the door open. \'You were not happy with my performance?\'

\'You performed perfectly. As always.' Madame Maxime's broad face shifted into a smile, then slipped back to a mild frown. \'I would like to discuss the other champions and their methods, as you didn't get to observe them first hand, I thought you might find it useful.\'

Fleur nodded and leant on the edge of the door. 'It sounds like a good idea, madame.'

*I would very much like to know how the boy evaded that feral monster of a dragon.*

Madame Maxime eased the door open with one finger. Fleur stumbled back, then settled back into her seat, sipping the warm, rich, sweetness of her hot chocolate as Madame Maxime squeezed herself into the other small chair.

\'The Hogwarts\' Champion, Cedric Diggory, was the first to compete,' said Madame Maxime. 'His plan was commendable, but not carried out effectively. However, he displayed some advanced transfiguration and it would be wise to assume he is equally proficient in other subjects.\'

*An exceptional student, but no more than that.* Fleur took another sip of her hot chocolate. *One of those boys born into a good family with good looks and good brains, but no friction to give him the drive to win.*

\'I do not think that the Hogwarts\' Champion will be your main source of competition,\' Madame Maxime said.

Fleur nodded and sipped her drink. 'I agree.'

\'Viktor Krum, too, displayed some proficiency.\'

Fleur suppressed the urge to roll her eyes and took another drink of hot chocolate. *Of course the boy will be last, even when he is not here, he finds some way to be annoying.*

\'Krum used the Conjunctivitis Curse to blind his dragon, his casting was very swift and accurate, but his plan did not account for the damage the injured dragon would do. Durmstrang\'s Champion is clearly a powerful and accurate spell caster, but lacks foresight. He is a dueller and a flyer, not a planner, but he will prove a strong rival in any task Karkaroff can help with the planning.\'

Fleur put her mug down and leant forward. \'And Harry Potter?\'

Madame Maxime smiled. \'He cheated. He took the model dragon and used a very powerful enlarging charm. The Horntail fought the model and while it was distracted Mr Potter used the Rupturing Curse to blind the eye on his side. The model, for all its enchantments, was only plastic and didn\'t last long, but the boy stole the egg in the gap.\'

\'An enlarging charm...\' Fleur frowned.

Madame Maxime tapped her fingers on the table. \'Disappointed by his simple solution?\'

Fleur swirled the hot chocolate in the mug. \'No. If it works, it

works.\'

\'Jealous, then?\' Madame Maxime asked.

\'It was a good solution, but only for this exact situation. I doubt he

is capable of creating the enchantments that were already on the model like I can. And even if he were, almost any magic would be able to defeat such a creation. It is impossible to create something capable of using magic as a witch or wizard does.\'

\'You must look deeper than his solution.\' Madame Maxime tutted and pushed Fleur's mug to the side of the table. \'The scale of the enlarging charm indicated surprising magical power for a fourteen year old, equal or better than any other champion, including yourself. His knowledge and use of a curse considered dark is also very interesting. Albus Dumbledore would not consent to it being taught here, so he must have another source of counsel. And at the end, when the dragon had him cornered, he stepped out to face it head on with no fear I could see.\'

*So he really wasn't afraid.* Fleur studied the polished rosewood of her wand. *Interesting.*

\'You're impressed with him,' she said.

\'Indeed I am.\' Madame Maxime placed her palms flat on the table. The chair groaned beneath her as she leant forward. \'There is something different about him. I'm sure you noticed it in your observation of your rivals.\'

*So she knows about that, too.* Fleur met Madame Maxime's dark brown eyes and glanced at her hot chocolate. *Perhaps she's just guessed from my absences and my knowledge of the disillusionment charm.*

\'I might have,' she said. '

\'He does not react to the allure in your magic, does he?\'

Fleur scowled. \'No, he didn't even notice me until the first task.\'

Madame Maxime smiled. 'I thought so. He is most curious. Openly using a curse such as the Rupturing Curse, brazenly cheating, and most of all, at the end for an instant, I thought I sensed a spell.'

Fleur's lips twitched. *If only I could've watched. I would've been*

*able to sense much more than you, despite your heritage.*

'What kind of spell?' she asked. 'What did it feel like?'

'It was just a feeling,' Madame Maxime said. 'Like a fingertip

sliding down my spine. And I only felt it for a moment.' 'But if *you* felt it.'

Madame Maxime's eyes narrowed a fraction. 'I may not be gifted with the deftness of your family, Fleur, but I didn't need it to sense that magic. If the horntail had not been stunned by its handlers, I think we might've seen something spectacular.'

Fleur dragged her hot chocolate back over and took another sip. *Cold.* She tapped the mug with her wand until spirals of steam rose from the dark liquid. *Much better.*

\'He is not to be underestimated,\' Madame Maxime said. \'You cannot beguile him with the allure of your magic without capturing every eye in the room, he appears to be much more powerful than we suspected, and he knows and has used at least one morally questionable curse.\'

\'I will not. I have met many boys who can resist my magic to begin with. They crumble when I actually exert some focus or intent upon them, all I'd need is a moment in the tournament when nobody can see.\'

*It's not cheating.* Fleur's stomach knotted itself tight. *But it's not*

*how I want to win, either.*

\'Perhaps,\' Madame Maxime said. \'I must insist you be wary of him all the same, though. He has cheated already, he might do so again and in a less benign fashion. It was his breaking of the rules alone that cost him the points that would have placed him first. If he'd had the presence of mind to summon the toy from the tent, you'd be second.\'

*What?!* Fleur stared into Madame Maxime's eyes, but found no hint of a lie. *She's not trying to motivate me. She genuinely thinks that.* Fleur swallowed down a bitter taste and a flare of heat, feathers prickling beneath her skin. *I got beaten by a fourteen year old. Unacceptable.*

\'I do not know the mind of the boy at all well.\' Madame Maxime squeezed out of her chair and stepped to the door in a single stride. \'But he has unsettled even Albus Dumbledore.\'

*He looked as proud as he did concerned.* Fleur closed the door behind Madame Maxime. *Still, in essence he won. It would be silly to assume he'll make another small mistake again.*

She gulped down the last of her hot chocolate. 'He will be as much a rival as Krum, only he has the advantage of no expectation.'

*Dumbledore must've put him in the tournament.* Fleur tapped her mug with her wand and set the clean china piece down on the bedside

table next to a slim envelope. *A good way to help him grow. It will hurt*

*him, but like me, he'll get stronger because of it.*

She snatched the letter to Gabby off her bedside table and tucked it down the front of her blue robes.

Casting the disillusionment charm she snuck out of the carriage, slipping between Caroline and Emilie when they opened the door.

Fleur trudged to the top of a grey, dreary tower that rang with the hoots and screeches of owls. A room of thick, wooden beams and worn perches waited beyond a small, battered old door. Sour bird droppings and dry must hung like smoke.

*Beauxbatons' Birdcage is far more elegant than this dirty old attic.*

She sniffed and tip-toed into the centre of the room. *But at least there's*

*nobody to ask me to be their Yule Ball date up here.*

\'That is a *very* good disillusionment charm.\' A half-familiar voice echoed from the door, carrying with it a hint of admiration and amusement.

*Merde. Of course, he notices me when I am invisible. What a vexing boy.*

Fleur dispelled the charm. 'Merci. How did you notice?\'

\'Miss Delacour.\' His eyes flicked past her to the owls. \'I'm aware of

the weaknesses of the charm and thus capable of recognising it.\'

Fleur's gaze dipped to his empty hands. \'What are you doing up

here?\'

Harry Potter raised his eyebrows and glanced around the room.

\'Sending a letter... As I assume you are, since this isn't the most scenic part

of the castle.\'

\'No I'm not.\' Fleur sighed. \'I have no owl.\'

His brow creased. \'Perhaps I could offer you the use of my owl?\'

Fleur wrestled with her pride. \'Didn't you just send a letter?\'

\'I was sending a letter to my godfather. For one reason or another I've not been able to contact him until now, but he sent his own owl and I returned my letter with it.\'

\'I didn't realise you had a godfather.'

\'Not many do.\'

He edged past her, leaving an arm's length between them. Dust

covered the back of his robes as they brushed against the beams.

*That was nice of him. Most men take any chance to brush against me.* Fleur pulled her wand out of her sleeve and vanished the dust. *There, now we're even.*

'Thanks,' Harry Potter said.

A beautiful, black-speckled, snowy owl perched by the window on the far side of the tower top. It shot Harry a full glare, then swivelled its head around to look in the other direction.

He laughed. \'Don\'t be like that, Hedwig. I was going to give you a letter to deliver on behalf of an acquaintance of mine.

*An acquaintance?* Fleur found the taste of the word bitter. *I suppose I am, but most boys would call me a friend to my face. Does he not care what I think at all?*

Hedwig\'s head twisted back round, then she hooted and hopped closer to Harry, nibbling at his fingers.

Harry Potter laughed. \'I knew you wouldn\'t be able to resist.' He

turned to Fleur and held out his hand. \'Do you have the letter? She\'s a bit

particular about who gives her the things she takes, nearly took one of my

friend's fingers a year ago.\'

*One of the friends who turned their back on you?* Fleur slipped her hand inside her uniform and pulled the warm envelope from under the strap of her bra. *Let's hope he doesn't realise where I stashed it, though if his past lack of attention is any indication, he might not even care.*

Harry pinched the uppermost corner between his thumb and forefinger and passed it to Hedwig.

Fleur stared. *He's that disgusted by my body heat?* She stifled a laugh. *Forget about my magic's allure, if I want to beat him, perhaps I can just hug him.*

\'Gabrielle Delacour,\' Harry Potter read off the envelope. \'It's a

long way to Beauxbatons from here, Hedwig. Can you find her?\'

The bird fluffed its feathers up and took off through the window.

Harry Potter chuckled. \'I shall take that as a yes.' He watched Hedwig soar away into the drizzle, then turned to Fleur with a wrinkled brow. 'Your younger sister?\'

\'Yes. I often write to Gabby. She misses me when I'm away.\'

*And I miss her. Only a veela understands what it means to be a*

*veela.*

\'It must be nice for her to hear from you,\' Harry Potter said. \'I\'m sure your family finds it equally nice to hear from you.' Harry Potter laughed.

Fleur winced. *Merde. He's an orphan.*

\'I\'m sorry.'

\'Don\'t worry.\' Half a smile crooked his lips. \'It\'s actually almost refreshing to have somebody forget.\'

\'They stare,\' Fleur murmured.

\'Yes, they do.\' His green eyes froze hard and cold, then melted into a bright, brilliant smile.

*The same one he gave Rita Skeeter. Smiles are simple lies.* Fleur's stomach twisted and writhed. *Girls like Rita Skeeter deserve to be smiled at like that, but not me. I'm not like them.*

\'Madame Maxime told me about your task,\' she said.

Harry Potter eyed the door behind her. 'More questions? Well, at least you've not stolen my glasses this time.'

Fleur twitched. 'I'm afraid I don't understand.'

The corner of Harry's lips curved into the same half-smile. \'No? That doesn't sound familiar? It must've been another French witch with an exceptional grasp of the disillusionment spell, then. What did Madame Maxime say?\'

Fleur stepped across in front of the door. \'She said you cheated by bringing the model dragon in and that if you had summoned it, you might've got full marks.\'

A spark of anger flickered in his eyes and faded. \'I forgot about the wands only rule. How stupid of me.\'

\'You still came second.'

Amusement danced in his green eyes. \'Second is not first, is it?\'

\'Non. You intend to try and win now.\'

\'Winning will prove to myself that I'm stronger than I used to be.'

*You've years to get stronger.* Fleur tried to see the child that ought to be standing in front of her. *Yet what else is there but winning, when everyone turns against you.*

\'You're fourteen---'

\'When I win, I'll let you read my name off the Triwizard Cup.\' His green eyes turned cold and sharp as the winter icicles that hung from her window. \'I *guarantee* it won't say my age.' Harry Potter swept past her and down the steps.

*There'll be other chances.* Fleur listened to his footsteps echo down the tower. *Even if he doesn't feel the allure in my magic, I'm still the prettiest girl he's seen. He'll talk to me.*

She recast her disillusionment spell and wandered round the

quidditch pitch's edge.

Ludo Bagman sat in the bottom row of the stands beside a witch dressed in official ministry robes. A sharp glint lurked in the witch's eyes as they muttered together.

Fleur gave the two of them a wide berth.

A third person appeared from nowhere in front of her. She twisted round the rat-faced wizard and froze.

He cocked his head, sniffing the air, his small, watery eyes darting all around and his long fingernails curling from his tattered sleeves like claws.

Fleur wrinkled her nose as the reek of stale food and dirt reached her. *Perhaps this is Argus Filch, the infamous squib caretaker.*

The wizard scuttled into the shadows of the red and gold painted

section.

Silence loomed in his absence. Every shadow held a hundred dark

creatures, the posts jutted into the sky like the spires of Nurmengard, and eyes settled on her from the darkness beneath the pines at the pitch's edge where the wards ended.

Fleur shivered and her heart picked up, hammering against her ribs. *Time to leave this place.* She didn't look back until she'd closed the door of Beauxbatons' carriage behind her.

# The Secrets of the Darkest Arts

Dark clouds streamed across the ceiling of the Great Hall. Plates and cutlery clattered beneath the distant rumble of the thunder.

Harry folded Sirius' letter in half, then tucked it under the edge of

his plate.

*So my invisibility cloak's a very old family heirloom.* Harry stared up at the teachers' table. *If it resists summoning charms, the revealing spell, and all the others Sirius listed, maybe it could've let me cross the age line. Dumbledore had it, he probably knows it could've, that's why he thinks I did it.*

He pulled the Marauders' Map out of his pocket and scanned the swarm of names. 'Igor Karkoroff's not in the castle and Professor Moody's still in his office, like always. Which leaves Snape, who's in his office as well, but I'm pretty sure Sirius only suggested Snape because he hates him.'

Another name appeared at the edge of the quidditch pitch.

*Peter Pettigrew.* He bounced his wand inside his sleeve on the tip of his finger. *If I catch him, I can prove Sirius' innocence.*

The name vanished.

*Next time.*

\'Harrikins!\' The twins slid themselves onto the bench across from

him. 'Long time no see.'

\'We should probably stop calling him that, Fred.\'

*I've been called worse.* Harry tucked the letter out of sight. *Quite a lot worse.*

\'I suppose,\' the other, possibly George, said. \'He did survive the

dragon.\'

\'Shouldn\'t the two of you be over there?\' Harry nodded in the

direction of Angelina, Alicia, and Katie.

\'No,\' Fred said. 'You see---'

'---they\'re coming over here,\' George said. \'We told you this wouldn\'t last long if we could help it.\'

Fred winked. \'Although it was *Katie* that did most of the

persuading.'

Harry watched the three Gryffindor girls approach and drew a calm face over the cocktail of feelings churning in his stomach. He pictured the circle of black ink on white paper and took a quiet, deep breath, letting himself sink into its darkness.

\'Angelina, Alicia.' He smiled. 'Katie.'

'Harry.' Katie squirmed. 'Nice to see you again.'

Angelina put her hands on her hips. \'I was assured you'd hear me

out, despite Hermione telling me otherwise.\'

\'I promised somebody that I'd at least listen to you. I always keep

my promises.\'

She drummed her fingers on her hip. \'Then I'm sorry about what I did. You've represented both Gryffindor and Hogwarts as well as I could've, regardless of whether you used an invisibility cloak to put your name into the goblet.\'

\'So you don't believe me, but have moved past your jealousy at not being chosen yourself.\' Harry cast a glance down the table at Hermione and Ron. 'An invisibility cloak isn't enough to cross an age line. I heard someone in Ravenclaw tried it.'

Angelina's fingers curled into her waist and her knuckles turned pale. \'I suppose that's a fair enough description.'

*She'd do it again.* Harry's thoughts welled up from the back of his mind in a soft, smooth, high whisper. *Forgive and forget, and I'll be betrayed next time, too.*

\'Then I'll tell you what I told the rest of you. I don't trust you anymore. We're not friends---\' he glimpsed Katie's brow furrowing '---but I don't want to fight about a stupid tournament, so let's just... let's say it's like we'd never met.'

Katie beamed, her mahogany eyes glimmering beneath her messy

fringe. 'Thank you, Harry.'

'I get the feeling you don't mean *Katie*,' Alicia muttered.

\'She was the one who convinced me to listen to you, so no, I don't mean Katie.'

Alicia smirked. \'I\'m not very surprised Katie didn\'t go along with

everything.'

Katie flushed and tugged at her little finger. 'Thank you for listening.' She shot a glance at her friends, who stepped back and took a seat several metres down the table.

\'I said I would.\' Harry eyed Katie's fingers, her anxious fidgeting seeping into him. 'Er...'

\'Do you want to go to Hogsmeade at the weekend?\' she blurted.

\'Who\'s going?\' Harry asked. \'Me,\' Katie whispered.

*Oh. Like a date.* Harry blinked. *A date with Katie.*

She stared up at him with wide eyes, biting at her lower lip. \'If you

don\'t want to go it\'s ok,' she murmured.

*She's cute and she's fun.* Harry struggled for a reason to say no.

*And she stuck by me.*

\'What time?\' he asked.

Katie grinned, a bright pink blush blossoming on her cheeks. \'Eleven. I\'m not much of a planner. We can figure out what to do when we get there.\'

*What am I meant to do? Or wear?* Harry's stomach coiled into a

knot. *Maybe I should've said no.*

\'Sounds perfect.\' He flashed her a smile.

Katie\'s blush bypassed all remaining intermediate shades of red and skipped straight to crimson. She glanced back down the table to where Angelina and Alicia were giggling to each other, bouncing forward and wrapping her arms round him.

A soft warmth enveloped him.

Harry slid his arms back round her, breathing in the scent of fresh cut grass, broom polish, and coffee.

\'I\'m sorry, I\'ve never asked anyone on a date before and I sort of expected you to say no.\' Katie's words tumbled over one another into a happy burble. \'I need to get some food and go find Angelina and Alicia and

then there are classes...' She gave him a wave and a smile, skipping off to her friends.

\'Hogsmeade with Katie Bell.\' Ginny spoke up from a few places down the table.

*How long has she been there?*

\'Er... Yes, I think.'

\'I was going to ask you if you\'d take me to the Yule Ball,\' Ginny chirped, her smile trembling. \'But if you\'re going on dates with Katie, then you\'ll be going with her.\'

\'I guess I will be.'

*It would be a bit strange if I didn't ask her now.*

\'I suppose I\'ve missed my chance, then.' Ginny's smile shrank a

fraction.

them.\'

Harry studied the lines on his palm, stifling a grimace. 'Sorry---'

\'I can go with Dean or with Michael. I\'ll enjoy myself with either of

\'Don\'t make any decisions with me in the back of your mind,\' Harry

said. 'I like Katie. She's fun. And nice. And, well, Katie.'

\'Ah.\' A sad, small smile crept onto Ginny's lips and she blinked

several times. \'I hope you enjoy going with Katie, then.\'

*I'm not the boy you grew up dreaming about. I've never been the*

*boy any of you grew up hearing about.*

'I think I'm probably going to hate the Yule Ball,' he murmured.

*Katie will make it bearable.* Harry headed for the Chamber of Secrets. *Salazar's very unlikely to cry, ask me on a date, or invite me to a ball. Well, I certainly hope he doesn't, at least.*

Ron rose from his seat and stepped into his path. \'What the

bloody hell did you say to my sister?'

Dean glowered past Ron's shoulder, fists and jaw clenched.

*Ginny did mention Dean. Did he ask her already?*

\'I told her something I think she already knew I was going to tell her, but hoped I wouldn\'t.'

\'Was she not good enough for you?\' Dean banged his goblet on

the table. 'You thought it was alright to just toss her away?' \'Would you rather I'd lied to her?'

\'So you just crush her and walk away?\' Ron's face turned puce. 'Does she mean *nothing* to you?!'

\'Better she understands now and has the chance to move on.' Harry sighed. 'Seriously, Ron. The longer she goes on wishing, the worse it is when it doesn't come true. She's your sister, the little girl I saved in second year. This is the right thing to do for us both.'

Dean snorted. 'Something tells me you're more concerned about yourself, mate.'

Ron snarled. \'If you\'ve hurt her---'

A little cold tightened beneath his ribs. \'You\'ll do *what?\'* Harry let his wand slip into his hand. \'It's not your place to decide things for Ginny, but if you want to play at being the protective older brother, you can start by asking *Dean* what his intentions were in asking her to the Yule Ball.\'

Ron swivelled to stare at Dean.

\'I was going to tell you if she said yes,\' Dean said. \'But she wanted time to think about it, obviously because she wanted to go with *him*.\'

Ron chewed that over clenching and unclenching his fists. \'It\'s alright. I trust you, Dean, but if you upset her the same bloody rules apply. You\'ll have me and all her older brothers to explain yourself to.\' He glared at Harry. \'You\'ve already hurt her, you arrogant prat, and you'll pay for it.\'

Harry snorted. 'You think you scare me? More than a dragon? A

basilisk? *Voldemort?'*

Ron flinched.

'Exactly.' Harry slid his wand back into his sleeve. 'If you can't even say a silly made up name, you might as well get the hell out of my way.' He brushed through the pair of them and headed for the chamber.

\'Did you read all the books?\' Salazar asked as Harry carried him over the bridge.

\'I did.\' Harry staggered to the side of the chamber and leant the picture against the wall. 'More than once. Some took a few tries to wrap my head around.'

'You understand the principles, then?\' Salazar asked. 'How blood magic, sacrificial magic, and rituals all fit together.'

\'I understand the principles, but not how you would decide on an appropriate sacrifice.\'

\'That comes from understanding yourself and what you're after.

Was there anything in the books that caught your eye?\'

\'Yes.\' Harry opened *the Secrets of the Darkest Arts.* 'There're over a hundred pieces of parchment covered in Tom Riddle's handwriting

stuffed in this book. I found it curious he'd devoted so much effort to the

subject, but it wasn't part of my reading.\'

Salazar frowned down at the book. 'Tom, like yourself, found he

took well to certain areas of magic and pursued them single-mindedly.' Harry tapped the tome. \'Do you know what a Horcrux is?\'

Salazar nodded. \'It's an old branch of soul magic. It involves separating a piece of a person\'s soul to anchor them to the world when they would otherwise die, though I suspect the *separating* isn't as simple as it sounds.\'

*I was less than the meanest ghost, but I was alive.* Harry recalled

Voldemort's words in their first meeting. *That's how he survived.*

\'Tom Riddle created one,' he said.

\'Whatever he made into a horcrux is anchoring him here,' Salazar said. 'It will have to be destroyed before Voldemort can be killed.\'

\'How can I find it?\'

\'Casting the person revealing charm might locate it once you were close enough. The charm is derived from soul magic and may well identify a fragment of a person\'s soul as well as the whole thing.\' Salazar stroked his chin with one hand and the head of his snake with the other. \'These items will be very dangerous. A soul fragment, if brought into close proximity, could theoretically affect those around it in all manner of ways.\'

Harry's eye drifted to the clean patch of stone near the maw of the basilisk's corpse. *All manner of ways, huh. Like showing memories, absorbing life, and casting magic?*

\'Could it possess someone?\'

\'I believe it could in the right circumstances,\' Salazar replied. \'But

I've little practical experience with this aspect of soul magic. Why?\'

\'When I slew your basilisk it had been unleashed on the school by a girl possessed by a shade of Tom Riddle. The shade was connected to a diary and was only destroyed when I stabbed it with a basilisk fang.\'

*It was a horcrux.* A grim certainty settled on Harry. *But if I destroyed it, does that mean Riddle is finally dead?*

\'That may very well have been a horcrux. What else did the diary

do?\'

\'It wrote back if you wrote in it, it showed me his memories, and it

tried to drain the life from Ginny to become real again.\'

\'Horcrux or not, that was certainly no ordinary enchanted book,\'

Salazar said. 'It is likely the diary contained a soul fragment.\'

*Someone needs to know.*

\'I have to tell Professor Dumbledore,\' Harry said. \'I gave the book back to Lucius Malfoy after leaving the chamber, what if it's not completely destroyed?\'

\'Basilisk venom is an unnatural substance, designed to destroy both organic tissue and any magic it comes into contact with. Whatever that diary was, horcrux or not, it's destroyed. This Professor Dumbledore, he is Albus Dumbledore, the same one that taught Tom Riddle and defeated Grindelwald, a powerful wizard?\'

\'Yes. He's recognised as the most powerful living wizard.\'

\'If he's as powerful and knowledgeable as Tom Riddle feared and

you believe, then I've little doubt he knows exactly what the diary was.'

Harry shook his head. \'He would have told me. Or, he would've told someone in the ministry. We'd've seen *something* happen.'

Salazar stroked his chin. \'Perhaps, but it seems he hasn\'t, and I can\'t help but wonder *why*. There's too much that we don't know.\'

\'He might not've realised.\'

*But he always knows. Every year.* Harry scowled. *Dumbledore suggested we use the time-turner to save Sirius and Buckbeak, Fawkes came to help with the basilisk, and Dumbledore found me before the Mirror of Erised twice.*

\'It doesn't yet matter,' Salazar said. \'We've no real proof he ever created one, just a stack of notes on the subject. Read through them and perhaps we'll learn something. Albus Dumbledore will have his reasons for keeping this a secret. It's possible he intends to quietly destroy the other anchor and wishes to ensure Voldemort does not suspect anything.\'

*And Trelawney made that stupid prophecy about him rising again,*

*so he can't have died during second year.*

\'There has to be another anchoring horcrux,\' Harry said. \'The diary was destroyed by the basilisk venom, so there has to be another one somewhere.\'

\'The horcrux will be well hidden and warded.' \'I'm surprised he left the notes.'

\'Tom was the last of his family,\' Salazar murmured. 'Not only is this place well protected by the basilisk, but many wards, too. It was as much a sanctuary to him as it is to you now.\' Salazar sighed and his eyes darkened. \'Tom's hubris was born in this room and it grew to consume him, amongst other things. He would've never believed I might find a more

suitable heir than him even if some other blood relative came here, so he likely expects my Chamber of Secrets to be his for as long as he lives.\'

\'Professor Dumbledore must be searching for the other horcrux,\'

Harry said. 'That must be why he's not said anything.'

\'Or he's already found the anchor and is searching for a way to destroy it and confirmation it's the only one. It's unlikely there are more than a few, the side effects of soul magic are not something to lightly risk.\'

*He didn't look human.* The crimson eyes, slit nostrils, pale face and smoke-black spirit of Voldemort flashed through Harry's mind. *Barely human at all.*

\'What kind of effects?\'

\'The soul is a reflection of many things,\' Salazar said. \'I studied the subject in an attempt to create an artefact such as the one my daughter and I searched for. I swiftly gave up when I realised I didn't have enough of my lifetime left to master such magic.\'

'When I saw him in first year, he looked inhuman.'

'Voldemort, for it seems there's little left of Tom, appears to have severely damaged himself, or, at least, changed himself. I would imagine it is the result of however you create horcruxes or whatever he's done that allowed him to be able to create them.\' Salazar shuddered. 'It would require a truly terrible desire to live, nothing less than an act of absolute selfishness would be powerful enough to fuel such magic, likely inflicting the very thing the creator wishes so desperately to escape on another to save himself.'

\'Is his soul weaker?\'

\'A soul doesn't have strength in such a simple way. It's the

essence of yourself. Your intentions in all things, great and small, and

everything associated with them. Your body has strength, your magic has power, your mind has its intellect and will. The soul is that little bit more behind them. Any soul magic is cast upon your own consciousness and magic itself. Something not to be undertaken lightly, Harry.\'

*So true soul magic's another very abstract, powerful kind of magic. Like blood magic, but the medium's your intent and magic itself.*

# Living Anchor

Pages of Tom Riddle's neat, elegant script stretched across the floor of the chamber, weighted down by conjured glass balls. Harry stared down at them from the tip of the tongue bridge.

'There's a *lot* of detail,' Salazar said. 'If he didn't perform the magic himself, he must've witnessed it, or received a very detailed account from someone who had.'

\'The theory behind creating a horcrux is in particularly great detail.\' Harry skimmed the section beneath the purple glass weights. \'It's much more than what's in the book.'

\'Tell me.'

\'Like you suspected, they\'re created by inflicting the very thing the creator wishes to avoid upon another.' Harry grimaced. 'A wizard or witch of sufficiently strong mind can tear a fragment away and place it within another object. Riddle has corrected the book and written that the soul is *a symbolic representation that creates an emotive focus for a very complex piece of magic that would otherwise be impossible to cast*, nothing is *actually* torn.\'

\'What type of object?\' Salazar asked.

\'It doesn't say, but I assume it's not just any, since the notes often mention things that don\'t work.\' Harry shuddered. 'The more I read, the more I get the feeling this was cobbled together from trial and error.'

\'So what could be a horcrux?\'

'Riddle thinks they have to be of great importance or value to the

creator, otherwise the creator doesn't feel enough of a connection to them

to successfully imbue them with a reflection of themselves. Once they're created, they\'re supposed to be almost impossible to destroy, basilisk venom and Fiendfyre are the only two things mentioned, but Tom speculates magic of a similar nature but opposite intention to their creation might also work.'

'And how does Tom think they worked?'

'As an anchor of sorts. Tom perceives the soul as more of a magic- powered sense of self. Someone with strong will and powerful magic can survive so long as that sense of self endures. He believes the magic of a horcrux imbues an object with a reflection of the creator's self, their intent as a whole. The bond is then strong enough to tie themselves to life, even if the person's body is destroyed. He thinks that to create it, you must fuel your intent by demonstrating your absolute desire to remain alive. *A life for a life.*' Harry swallowed and tore his eyes away from the page.' And he's very sure it would require the Killing Curse, because that spell requires undiluted intent to kill.\'

Salazar stared at him. 'You may not thank me for saying this, Harry, but you've the very same knack my wife, daughter and Tom did. I don't think there are many wizards who'd grasp this so quickly.'

*I suppose it's a compliment. Just because Tom was good at something and did bad things with it, doesn't mean I should be ashamed of being good at that thing.*

\'There is some good news,' Harry said. 'The soul isn't eternal. Tom believes both will-power and the sense of self decays as one ages, achieves, and lives and the anchoring bond will fade. However, it can only fade when the creator's intent fades...\'

\'So should Tom achieve his ambitions, it may prove his undoing,\' Salazar mused. 'I wonder if you can recover from casting this piece of magic, though. The intent required to cast it, going so far as to inflict something you loathe upon another to escape it, that sort of act sacrifices

more of a person than you might think.' Shadows rose in Salazar's eyes. 'Perhaps that's what happened to Tom, twisted by the intent of his own soul magic, until nothing was left of his dreams and desires but an absolute will to endure.'

*An escape from the nothingness of death.* Harry tapped his foot on the rough scrawl marring the last few pages. Tom Riddle's broken quill tip stuck from the page beneath the words, surrounded by a circle of dark ink. *Lord Voldemort. Perhaps it is.*

'What about the book?' Salazar asked. 'What does it say?' 'Tom's corrected most of it.' Harry held out his hand and

summoned the book into his palm. 'There's a small section he didn't bother

with.' He skimmed the page. \'It's a warning. The author hypothesises that creating several horcruxes, or creating one and using the killing curse frequently afterward, may create such a strong mental association that in the right circumstances, horcruxes may be created accidentally because the intent of the creator's magic is affected by their resolution to endure. He talks about it as if it was healing. After a horcrux is made, the creator may move on and the horcrux will eventually fade as these other things are achieved, losing his immortality once his dreams are realised. In the absence of other true goals, an obsession with immortality itself may fester and then, should the circumstances of the piece of magic occur by extreme coincidence, an accidental horcrux may be created. A bond may well form between accidental anchor and owner, possibly resulting in the development of an obsessive interest, or, in the case of living creatures, a display of similar characteristics and skills.\'

*The very same knack.* Sharp ice-cold fingers tightened themselves around his stomach, piercing through to his spine. Harry took several deep breaths and pictured the circle of dark ink on the page, but Tom Riddle's quill tip stuck from it and the ink seeped out like it'd run from the diary after Harry had stabbed it.

Salazar stared at him. 'What's wrong, Harry?\'

\'In my second year, when the shade of Riddle opened the Chamber and I learnt I could speak Parseltongue, I asked Professor Dumbledore why Tom Riddle and I were so similar.\'

*And he knew. He's always known.* The fist of ice clenched in his shattered and seeped into his blood. A tang of iron pooled on Harry's tongue. *He's always fucking known!*

\'He told me he believed I'd absorbed a small piece of Voldemort\'s power when I was given this scar,\' Harry hissed, parseltongue slipping from his lips. \'It made us similar, he said, and gave me my ability to speak to snakes.\'

\'He lied to you.\' Salazar's speech wavered between Parseltongue and English. \'My blood magic cannot be passed on in such a way, it's imperative you have my blood for the magic to work. Magical power can't be absorbed in such a manner, either, or there would've been wizards killing each other left and right to do so. He knows about the horcruxes. He knows that you are one. He has always known.\'

*I'm a horcrux. I'm what is keeping Voldemort alive. Why me?* Harry's hands shook and the glass paperweights shattered one by one, dissolving into white mist. *It's so bloody unfair. So unfair.*

\'I have to die.' He tossed *the Secrets of the Darkest Arts* to the

ground. 'The diary is gone. When I'm dead, so's Voldemort.\'

Salazar scowled. \'I will not allow it,\' he hissed. \'You are the Heir of Salazar Slytherin, not a sacrifice to be used by lesser wizards. We will find another way or we will make one.\'

Harry slumped down onto the cold stone. \'How many will have to die before we find one? There's no point hoping, better to just get it over with.\'

\'As many as necessary,\' Salazar spat. \'We don't know how many of these horcruxes Riddle has made besides yourself, your death may simply ensure his secret remains undiscovered.\'

\'I can\'t tell Dumbledore I know about them.'

\'No. You cannot. We can\'t predict his reaction. He may be searching for other horcruxes, or keeping you alive as long as he can, but the moment you become a liability, he might kill you. Worse things have been done for the greater good.\'

\'I'm not a match for *Albus Dumbledore*.\' Harry stared at the slim crack joining the stones between his feet. 'Voldemort might be, but I don't think he's going to be much help.'

*I'll have to walk a path apart from either of them.* Harry sighed.

*Alone.*

\'I will think on this,\' Salazar said. 'A solution may present itself.\'

\'Tempus,\' Harry murmured, tapping his wand on his wrist.

*A few minutes to eleven*. Harry groaned. *Katie...*

The Marauder\'s map showed Katie waiting for him at the entrance

hall. Pettigrew's name hovered at the edge of the quidditch pitch where

the wards ended and vanished off the corner of the map.

*Smile, Harry.* He strode from the chamber. *It's not Katie's fault,*

*make sure she enjoys her date. It might be how she remembers you.'*

Katie hovered near the entrance, wrapped up in a thick duffel coat and an orange and yellow scarf. Her hair was tied up on her head, her lips red, and her eyelashes dark. Harry transfigured his creased robes into something more fitting and patted at his hair. It sprung back up straight away.

coming.\'

\'Harry.\' Katie beamed. \'I was beginning to worry you weren\'t

\'Well I'm nervous, but not *that* nervous.\'

*Well, I was. Not now, though. No point in being nervous now. No*

*point in being anything.*

She grinned and slipped her arm through his. Her warmth radiated from his shoulder to where their thighs brushed.

\'So where are we going?\' Harry asked. \'Madam Puddifoots?\'

\'The place with all the pink?\' Harry tried to picture sporty, casual Katie there among all the fluffy cushions and hearts. 'Really?'

*Please say no. It's such an awkward, uncomfortable shop.*

\'Yes, do you mind?\'

\'Not if that\'s what you want,\' Harry said. \'It doesn\'t really seem

like your sort of place, though.'

\'Full marks, Harry.\' Katie laughed. 'Definitely not my cup of tea.

But I *did* enjoy the brief look of horror you wore.\'

\'So you don\'t want to go?\' Harry sighed. 'That's a relief. You know it actually ranks higher than Snape's office on the list of places Gryffindor boys never want to find themselves?'

\'All girls like a little romance, but that\'s not my type. Let\'s go to the Shrieking Shack. We can meet up with Angelina, Alicia and the Twins afterward?\'

He nodded and led the way to the Shrieking Shack. Katie bounced alongside him, a broad grin on her lips. Stray locks of her hair slipped from her bun and dangled down over her eyes.

\'I love this place. Nobody ever dares come in, but it\'s so cool.\' Katie glanced around, then pointed to the dent Professor Lupin had left in the wall. *\'That\'s* new.'

\'Do you know the real story?\' Harry asked.

\'No, everyone just knows it\'s haunted. I didn't know there *was* a

real story!'

\'I can tell you, if you like?\'

Katie brushed the splinters off the three-legged chair and gestured for Harry to sit on one half. He obliged.

Katie took the other side, wrapping an arm around his waist to

keep her balance. \'Tell me.'

\'A while back there was a student at Hogwarts who was a werewolf. Every full moon he'd come here to transform, sneaking out of the castle using a secret passage. The werewolf was lucky enough to have three friends who didn't care what he was and they decided, in order to help him, that they'd become animagi.\'

\'How would that help?\' Katie eyed the claw marks on the walls. \'Werewolves aren't dangerous to animals, their bite only affects

humans. However, the transformation is supposed to be very painful and

so to keep him company, they turned into animals and came here with him.\' \'Did nobody ever realise?\'

\'I don\'t know,\' Harry said. \'That\'s more or less the whole of the story as I know it.\'

\'How did you learn about the place?\'

\'Do you remember Professor Lupin?\' Harry asked.

\'Yes. He was a really good teacher, but he resigned because\... *Oh*.

He was the student.\'

\'He told me about it last year.'

\'Who were the other three, then?\'

\'Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew, and James Potter.\' His voice cracked at the last name and he glanced away with a grimace.

\'Your father.\' Katie squeezed his shoulder and gave him a smile. \'Thanks for telling me the story, Harry. It must mean a lot to you.\'

'In a way.'

\'I come here almost every time I visit Hogsmeade, but I never knew what it was actually for.\'

\'What *did* you think it was?\'

\'I always thought it was a hoax,\' Katie said. \'I never saw any ghosts when I came here.\'

\'Well, now you know.\'

Katie tucked herself under his arm. \'It\'s good you\'re taller now.

You can keep me warm.\'

\'It *is* a little cold.' Harry waved a hand at the walls. 'The shack doesn't really have much insulation, either.'

Katie beamed and shifted a little closer to Harry. A loud snap echoed through the room and they thudded to the floor.

Harry brushed his robes off and offered Katie his hand. 'Oops. I think that was Professor Lupin's favourite chair.'

Katie giggled and let him pull her to her feet. \'We\'ve broken part

of one of Hogwarts\' most iconic buildings.'

\'Professor Lupin won\'t mind. He started the demise of the chair

himself.\'

Harry surveyed the remnants as Katie brushed the dust off her

clothes and fingered his wand. *I could repair it, but then it'd be like this*

*moment never happened.*

'Ready?' he asked.

She nodded, dragging her hair out of its bun and shaking it free. 'That's better.' She grinned. 'Sorry, Harry. I'm happy to wear makeup for you, but I'm not tying my hair up until at least the third date.'

*Why would she wait --- oh.* Harry felt heat creep into his cheeks.

*Wow.*

that.'

don't.'

He scrabbled for some words. 'Careful. I might try and hold you to

Katie's grin came with a wicked gleam in her eye. 'I will if you

Harry forced himself to take a deep breath. 'I think I should

concede defeat now.'

'Well, I'm not sure you can go any more red in the face anyway.' Katie laughed and slipped her hand into Harry's, her soft, warm fingers curling through his.. 'Let\'s go to the Three Broomsticks. We're out of chairs here.'

They made their way back towards Hogsmeade\'s best pub. Harry let the quiet song of the birds, the gentle breeze, and the smell of the woods wash over him, his steps springing over the frosty ground.

Angelina, Alicia, and the Weasley Twins sat round a table pressed against the side wall of the inn. Shouts, cheers, and the buzz of conversation rolled over Harry like a breaking wave.

*Loud.* He grimaced.

'C'mon.' Katie pulled him toward the table.

Angelina stole a pair of chairs from the table behind and glared when the bunch of third years tried to protest. \'All we need now is the keeper.'

\'It\'s a good thing Wood\'s left to join the big leagues.\' A twin, Harry presumed Fred since he was closest to Angelina, offered a broad grin. 'He wouldn't be happy with this.'

\'Indeed, brother mine,\' George said. \'He\'d be outraged.\'

Fred snickered. \'He\'d be the only member of the team not dating another teammate.\'

Katie disappeared into the crowd by the bar.

Harry laughed. \'We\'d get a very long lecture about squad relations, then he would've forced us all to be married so we couldn\'t separate and harm the atmosphere of the team.\'

*Katie's nearly two years older than me.* His laughter faded. *A few successful dates and a few years and she might start thinking about stuff like that. That's not such a long way away.*

\'I got firewhiskey.\' Katie wriggled through the crowd and back to the table, three small glasses clutched in either hand.

\'How\'d you manage that?\' The twins stared at her like she'd just

turned water to wine.

\'Well the drinking age is seventeen.\' Katie shrugged. \'I might only be a fifth year and sixteen, but I\'m sitting with three sixth years who're nearly overage. I guess they just assumed I was, too.\'

\'What about Harry?\' Fred asked. \'He\'s an ickle fourth year.\' \'He\'s not ickle.\'

Angelina and Alicia burst into giggles and Harry inspected the grain of the table, willing the heat to fade from his face.

Katie flushed bright crimson. \'They never asked. I guess they assumed that if he can defeat a Dark Lord as a baby, he can manage alcohol.\'

\'Are you sure you can *manage* him, Katie?\' Alicia waggled her eyebrows.

\'I guess I\'ll be keeping the rest of these, then.\' Katie passed a single whiskey glass to Harry and each of the Weasley\'s, then swept the other three into a line in front of herself.

\'We\'ll behave.\' Angelina raised her palms. \'Harry doesn\'t want to see drunk Katie on his first date.\'

\'It would put even the most lovesick of suitors off,\' George said. \'I remember when Alicia was given a whole case of elderflower

wine because the shop lost her ordered bottle and the three of us drank it

on New Year\'s Eve. I took the candle you stole from the Great Hall and you got so angry you tried to transfigure me into a goblin.\' Angelina dissolved into giggles, gasping for breath.

Katie blushed. \'I didn\'t! I only *threatened*.\'

\'No. No,' Alica gasped through laughter. \'You tried *very* hard, but you were using a breadstick from the kitchens instead of your wand.\'

\'And you were certain that it was your wand,' Angelina said. 'Alicia ate it in front of you and you burst into tears because you thought you\'d never be able to do magic again.\'

\'I did not.\' Katie muttered. \'I don\'t remember doing any of that.\' \'Of course you don\'t.\' Alicia smirked. \'It was a thirteen bottle case

and you drank seven of them. You fell asleep in the middle of crying about

your breadstick and we had to carry you back to bed.\'

\'Never let her drink too much, Harry,\' Angelina said. \'She\'s very funny drunk, but an absolute disaster to deal with. We\'ve a hundred more stories from that night alone.\'

\'Well keep them to yourselves.\' Katie pushed her lips together

and curled them inwards into a small pout. 'Or I'll drink all these.'

Angelina crossed her arms. \'Go ahead.\'

Katie lined up the three glasses and gulped them down, placing

them in a neat row in front of her. She beamed. 'Done.'

\'Uh oh,\' Fred and George chorused. 'We\'re in trouble now.

\'Firewhiskey is potent stuff,\' Fred said. \'It\'s meant to give you a buzz no matter how much you drink, but the more you do the stronger and longer the feeling.\'

Harry glanced at the three empty glasses, then at his own. 'How

strong?'

\'Don\'t worry Harry,\' Katie cheered. 'If you can\'t beat \'em, join \'em.\'

She pushed his glass towards him.

The Weasley\'s linked arms and downed their own.

'Not that strong, just a little bit of cheer,' Fred said.

'Unless you drink several, brother mine,' George added. 'Then it's triple the effect!'

Harry eyed the amber liquid.

\'It doesn\'t hurt.\' Katie pushed it toward him with her fingertip.

\'You\'ll feel great.'

'One's fine,' Angelina said.

Alicia nodded. 'Three's trouble, but one's nothing.'

Harry raised the glass to his lips and tipped the firewhiskey down his throat. It seared down his throat like liquid flame, pooling into a deep, warm glow in his stomach. 'Actually, after the fire bit, it's not bad.'

\'See.\' Katie shuffled close to him, her hand resting on his thigh.

'It's a good buzz.'

'And three?'

Katie gave his leg a squeeze. 'I probably shouldn't have drunk three. Triple the buzz, but it messes with your head a bit too much. Just be nice to me and I won't bite.' She leant into his ear. 'Much larger chance of me tying my hair up today, now,' she whispered.

Harry laughed and let the warm tingle radiate through him. 'Don't make promises you can't keep, Katie,' he murmured back.

Angelina and Alicia dissolved into giggles again. Fred gave him a thumbs up and a wink.

'Definitely can't call you Harrikins, now,' George said.

\'How long does this last?\' Harry asked.

Not long,\' Fred said. 'For us, less than half an hour. For Katie, maybe a couple of hours.'

\'We should head towards Honeydukes,\' Alicia said. \'Fred

promised us chocolate and Lee's probably waiting there by now.\'

Angelina giggled. 'And we'll give Harry and Katie some time, so Katie can *tie up her hair*.'

Katie flushed. 'Go away, you quaffle-hogging whores.'

Alicia and Angelina burst into laughter again, rising and squeezing out past Harry.

Angelina bent to Harry's ear. \'Keep her cheerful,' she murmured.

\'Katie\'s an extremely emotional drunk, but lovely as long as she\'s happy.\'

Alicia smiled as she pulled her coat and scarf back on. \'Of course, being Katie and being drunk means just about anything could upset her. She once cried for ten minutes because she dropped her sandwich when we went to the kitchens after celebrating Lee\'s birthday.\'

Katie shook her head and beamed. \'I\'m always happy.' \'Thanks for the whiskey, Katie,' the Twins chorused over their

shoulder as they left.

\'Let\'s go wander.\' Katie slipped an arm about his waist, squirming over his lap to grab her coat.

Harry pushed himself up from his seat and helped her get her

arms back into her blue duffel coat. 'Where shall we wander?\'

\'I don\'t mind.\' She wrapped her arm back round his waist. 'Happy

to drift about as long as I'm with you.'

*As long as you're with me.* A lump swelled up in Harry's throat

and he turned his head away to blink back liquid heat from his eyes.

*Nobody's ever said anything like that to me before.*

Katie glanced around, then giggled and pushed him down a side alley. She wrapped her hand round her hair and coiled it atop her head, staring up at him and biting her lip.

*Why --- oh.* Harry gulped, anxiety fluttered in his stomach despite the warmth of the alcohol. *Is she serious?*

Katie burst into laughter. 'Just kidding. It's too cold out here and I'm not that sort of girl, just playing about. Takes more than three firewhiskeys to get me on my knees, Harry.'

He hid a flood of relief and a small pang of disappointment, stroking his chin in mock thought. 'We can always go back for a couple more?'

'Nice try.' Katie shook her hair back down over her scarf and dragged him out of the alley. 'I'm only teasing though.' Her eyes slipped down from his face and back up. 'Well, *this time* I'm only teasing.' She seized Harry's hand and bounced away up the street, tugging him after her.

# Kindred Spirits

The golden egg sat on a grime-speckled, white tile. Patches of black mould speckled the grout surrounding it. The pale tiles spread to dirt-smudged, watermark-spattered walls. A short poem about Cedric Diggory's jawline had been scribbled near the sink inside a lopsided heart.

*He's not that handsome.* Fleur poked the egg with her wand's tip.

*But the poetry is that bad. Who tries to rhyme jawline with defined?*

It wobbled, spun, then fell and split open. A piercing shriek filled the room.

Fleur slammed it shut. 'Irritating. As always.' She scowled at her reflection in the egg. 'Perhaps I ought to let Madame Maxime give me a few hints after all. Maybe the shrieking's even somehow the clue itself, rather than a protection for it.'

*But I doubt Harry Potter is being given any hints. And winning will taste sweetest if I beat him properly.*

'Back to the carriage, I think.' Fleur cast her disillusionment spell, grabbed the golden egg, and slipped out of the bathroom and headed for Madame Maxime.

Madame Maxime's huge frame loomed by the window in the

common area of the carriage. Empty tables and chairs surrounded her.

Fleur knocked on the door. \'Madame Maxime?'

\'Yes, Fleur?\' Madame Maxime set down her mug of coffee. 'You have a question about the second task?'

\'I was wondering if you knew of any creatures that emit such screams as the egg?\' Fleur patted the golden object.

Madame Maxime smiled. \'I\'m afraid I cannot say, but I would like to recommend you a book. I do not have it here, but Hogwarts\' Library certainly will. It is called *Magical Creatures of the Water and their Secrets.*\'

\'Thank you,\' Fleur said.

*But if the other champions know, they'll take the book out. Merde.*

She cast her disillusionment charm and ran for the library.

Fleur stalked the shelves, running her invisible finger along the spines of the books.

*Magical creatures. Magical creatures. Vampires. More vampires.* Fleur's finger fell into a large gap. *Veela... Someone's doing their research. On me, no doubt.* She frowned but moved on. *Aha, water creatures.*

'Grindylows. No.' She flicked through the pages. 'Merpeople...'

*The singing of the Merpeople cannot be understood above water*. *Any attempts to hear their singing above the waves will only be met by a loud shrieking.*

*Voila!* Fleur snapped the book shut. *Merci, Madame Maxime.*

She abandoned her charm, then strode to the witch's desk near the exit. 'I'd like to take this out, please.'

'You're Miss Delacour.' The witch drummed her fingers on the book. 'Very well. Champions of other schools have permission to withdraw books. You've a month, but you can extend that time if need be. There's no waiting list.'

*The task's further away than that.*

'I'm afraid I'll probably need it for a while.' She hid her smile. 'Can I keep it for a few months? Three?'

The witch nodded and tapped her wand on the book's cover. 'There's no waiting list. All yours, Miss Delacour.'

A door banged.

Fleur glimpsed familiar red hair through the small window. *Harry Potter's former friend.* She snatched her book off the desk and hurried behind the shelves.

'Hermione, c'mon,' Ron Weasley groaned. 'Show a little mercy,

yeah.'

'Hush,' the witch behind the desk hissed.

'Stop whining, Ronald.' Hermione swept her bushy hair out of her

eyes. 'Let's grab a table over there. I've stuff to tell you.'

*Stuff about Harry Potter again?* A stab of curiosity pierced Fleur and she crept along the shelf parallel.

'I took out all the books on veela, but they're rubbish.' Hermione huffed. 'Clearly they were all written by *wizards.* Six chapters of drawings of nude veela and less than half a chapter on what they can actually do!'

Fleur stifled a sigh. *Idiots. We have been around for thousands of years and wizards still only see pretty faces and curvy figures.*

Ron snorted. 'Can I see those chapters?' Hermione shoved her bag under her chair. 'No!'

'Fine.' Ron eyed the bag and leant his elbows on the table. 'Was

that it?'

'No, Ron. That's not *it*.' Hermione crossed her arms. 'There's something *wrong* with Harry. He spends all his time by himself. He avoids touching people wherever he can, he grimaces every time anyone raises their voice. Something *must* have happened at the World Cup.'

'That veela?

*So it's not about me.* Fleur edged a little closer. *Still, they're not very smart if they think Harry Potter developed behaviour like this over one summer.* She pressed her lips into a thin line and sighed. *It takes years to hurt someone that much. Years, betrayed trust, failed hope, and fickle friends.*

'Maybe it's a love potion.' Ron screwed his face up. 'Or some kind of loyalty potion?'

Hermione covered her face with her hands. 'There's no such thing as a *loyalty* potion and love potions require a close relationship to work. They inspire strong feelings when the dosed person thinks about whoever gave them the potion, but something has to be there already.'

'So that's a no to both?'

'It could be a love potion,' Hermione said. 'But that Bulgarian veela has no close relationship, his family has no magic, and we were there all the rest of the time.'

Ron shrugged. 'I dunno, then. I reckon he used his cloak to enter, if he did, but I'm not sure about anything else.'

Hermione moaned and thudded her forehead on the desk. 'I should've never cast that spell at his wand, Ron. I can't *believe* I was so stupid. He loved that wand and I broke it. He'll never forgive me.' She made a strange half-hiccup, half sob. 'You heard him. He doesn't want me and now he really *doesn't* need me.'

Ron grimaced, reaching out and patting her on the shoulder. 'I'm sure he'll come around, yeah. I mean, you broke his wand, Hermione. I'd be bloody pissed with you and Harry was way more fond of his wand than I'm fond of my new one. It's gonna take a while, isn't it?'

'I suppose,' Hermione whispered. 'I just --- I wanted --- I forgot --- I think sometimes I'm a bit too used to being right, Ron. I don't even consider being wrong until it's too late.'

*You have better friends than I did, Harry Potter.* A strange, soft hollow feel seized Fleur's heart. *But it seems they don't understand you any better than mine did me in the end.* She squashed the feeling and straightened up. *He's like me. He'll be fine. People like us always win. Always.*

Hermione sat up. 'I'm just worried. He's going on a *date* with Katie Bell. She doesn't like me very much, so that's not going to help. He'll find someone else, someone better at being his friend than me, and I'll never get another chance!'

'Quietly!' the witch at the desk hissed.

Fleur picked her way back through the shelves. *If he's smart, he'll try, but there aren't many people like us.* She paused, caught by a faint flare of temptation. *Maybe I could talk to him? He has nobody and Gabby's far away.*

She hastened to the nearest bathroom, slammed it shut and locked it, shoving the plug in the sink and wrenching the taps open. The water swirled and splashed, creeping up the white ceramic.

Fleur opened the egg and plunged it into the sink. The shriek shifted into gentle singing. She swept her silver hair over her right shoulder, dipping her left ear into the water.

'Come seek us where our voices sound. We cannot sing above the ground. And while you\'re searching ponder this; we\'ve taken what you\'ll sorely miss. An hour long you\'ll have to look, and to recover what we took, but past an hour, the prospect\'s black. Too late, it\'s gone, it won\'t come back.'

*Merde.* Fleur patted her ear and cheek dry with a handful of white towel. *That means the task will be underwater. My magic's hampered by the cold and wet. And they'll take something precious...*

She pulled the plug, drying her hands and tossing the towel back onto the rail. 'First things first, to find a way to survive underwater for an hour. Self-transfiguration is out, since I don't want to end up as some mangled harpy when I try to revert back to my natural form and get stuck between the two of them.'

She watched the water drain out of the sink and swept out of the bathroom. *Oh well. I'm better at enchanting anyway. There must be some way to turn water to air, or to create a more resilient version of the bubblehead charm.*

\'Miss Delacour.\' A smooth baritone rang out as she passed through the entrance to the Great Hall.

*Merde. The Yule Ball. I forgot to rein in my magic or disillusion myself.* Fleur swivelled, taking in the glazed eyes and hopeful faces of over fifty students. *Why must they all be so weak-willed?*

\'Would you do me the honour of accompanying me to the Yule Ball?\' A lean young man with patchy beard and stubble offered her a smile.

\'Sorry.\' She forced a smile. \'But no.\'

Hope blossomed on the faces of all the boys around her. Feathers prickled beneath Fleur's skin, the bones of her face shifted a fraction, and heat crept into the palms of her hands.

A dark-haired, blue-eyed boy with a neat, earnest appearance stepped out of the crowd and shot her a grin. \'Miss Delacour, my name is Roger Davies. I was hoping you would let me accompany you to the Ball?\'

*He would've made a better target for poetry than Cedric Diggory.* Fleur's eyes roved over his high cheekbones and strong, confident jawline. *Definitely a pureblood. There's a lot of generations of pretty witches and wealthy wizards in that face.*

The boys' faces fell. Girls muttered through the crowd, throwing sharp, bitter looks at her. Every eye burnt on her skin as if she stood before them naked.

*I hate this.* Fleur felt the tips of feathers start to slide through her skin beneath her robes. *I wish they'd just go away. None of them are like me. None of them.*

Harry Potter entered the hall from the far side, hand in hand with the same girl who'd passed Fleur the bouillabaisse. He glanced up at her and returned his attention to the girl at his side.

\'Non.\' Fleur tracked Harry Potter's progress across the hall. \'I\'m

afraid you may not.\'

Roger Davies gaped. 'Oh.'

Harry Potter's laughter echoed across the hall.

*He's laughing at me.* Fire boiled in Fleur's blood and it took every ounce of pride to suppress the shift of her body. *He --- he should know better than to laugh at me like all those stupid girls used to!*

'Let's see how you like it when everyone's laughing at *you*.' She drew herself up and forced a torrent of her allure into her magic, thrusting it out across the hall.

hall.

A ripple of glazed eyes, vacant, dreamy stares spread over the

Fleur smiled. *Now we're even, Harry Potter.*

Harry glanced round the room as the ripple reached him,

shrugged, and turned back to the girl he was arm in arm with.

Fleur gasped, her anger vanishing like a candle flame pinched between her fingers. *He can't possibly have not felt that.*

The girl beside Harry Potter glared at Fleur with white-hot fury.

The fingers of the hand not in Harry\'s clenched into a fist so tight her knuckles turned white.

*Oh, merde.* A cold sick feeling settled in Fleur's stomach. *I tried to enthral a boy in front of everyone. Just like they keep accusing me of doing. Merde. Merde. Merde.*

The girl started toward Fleur, ripping her wand out from under her coat, but Harry Potter caught her arm and whispered something in her ear. He gestured around them with one hand and a deep frown, and they became locked in an argument of furious whispers. She raised her wand again, yanking herself free, but Harry pulled her back. She stuffed her wand away and hauled him away into the corridor, two bright, furious patches of colour on her cheeks.

*He doesn't know what's going on. He's defending me.* Fleur turned on her heel and strode out, her stomach churning so much she feared she be sick in the corridor. *I've just done to that girl everything Emilie and Caroline accused me of doing to them*.

# Nobility's Curse

The portraits upon the stairway stared down at him, flitting between their frames, muttering and murmuring. The Fat Lady closed her eyes and crossed her arms.

*Where is she?* Harry pushed Sirius' letter further into his pocket. His gut twisted and turned like a barrelful of snakes. *I could've read this letter twice over by now*. *She can't still be angry at me for stopping her picking a fight with Fleur Delacour.*

The Fat Lady's picture swung aside. A trio of Gryffindor students

stumbled out and bustled past him.

Harry glanced at them and turned away. *Still no Katie.* He sighed and tried to crush the churning in his abdomen away, but it tightened like a vice. *She argued with her friends for me, she wouldn't leave me alone over something as small as this.*

The Fat Lady swung aside.

A flash of orange and yellow caught the corner of Harry's eye and

her whirled.

'Harry...' Katie's lip trembled.

\'Katie.' He clawed as bright a smile as he could over the anxiety. 'How've you been?'

Her brown eyes fixed on an empty portrait on the far side of the

stairs. 'Not great.'

\'Are you okay?\'

Her expression crumbled, tears glinting in the corner of her eyes. \'I

did something very stupid,' Katie whispered.

\'If it\'s about what happened in the Great Hall, then it doesn\'t matter,\' Harry said. \'I don\'t know why you were so angry with Fleur Delacour, I just didn't want you to get yourself in trouble.\'

Katie's fists clenched. \'Do you not *see* how she affects everyone around her?!\'

\'They all stare at her.'

*Like they all stare at me.*

\'She\'s *part-veela*, Harry,\' Katie said. \'I overheard Hermione telling the other guys in your year. They stare at her because she uses her magic to charm them into liking her.\'

*Does she?* Harry recalled the disillusionment spell, near perfect. *I've not noticed her doing it. In fact, she seems to try and keep to herself when she's not stealing my glasses.*

Katie's knuckles went white. 'She used it on you in the Great Hall!

We were together and she tried to *steal* you.'

*Oh.* The bottom dropped out of Harry's stomach. *I guess I just can't feel it as well as others. I wasn't as caught up in it at the World Cup, either.*

'I'm sorry.' He dug for other words. 'I didn't---'

\'She tried to steal you with her magic.\' Katie\'s lip trembled and she shoved her fists into the pockets of her robes. \'And when I got mad, you *defended* her!\'

\'I didn\'t know. I promise.'

*Stupid bloody idiot. I should've known Katie wouldn't start*

*something over nothing.*

'You shouldn't have said anything!' Katie's eyes filled with tears. 'I was so angry with you, Harry. *So* angry. If you'd just not said anything, it wouldn't have happened.'

A chill settled on Harry's spine. 'What wouldn't have happened?'

Katie bit her lip and a drop of clear liquid spilt down her cheek. 'Roger Davies asked me to the Yule Ball in the corridor afterward. I said yes.\'

*Why would you do that?* He tried to picture it, but Roger Davies'

face kept blurring into his own. *How could you do that?*

\'I\'m so sorry. I was angry. And the firewhiskey\...\' Tears poured down Katie's face. \'Maybe --- maybe after the Yule Ball, we can go on another date?\'

*Can't you just tell Roger Davies you've changed your mind?* Harry caught the question on the tip of his tongue. *He doesn't care about you at all.*

'Harry?' Katie whispered. 'Please say something.'

*Does it matter why?* A smooth, high murmur welled up in the back of Harry's skull, rising up like cold, black water bubbling from a drain. *If she's capable of doing it once. She's capable of doing it again. If I forget that, I'll just find myself here again. If I forgive her, she'll think it's ok to hurt me again.*

A little ball of cold settled over Harry's heart.

Katie reached a hand out and collapsed into his chest. Her warm tears soaked into the shoulder of his robes.

\'I *was* going to ask you to the Yule Ball.' Harry found words beneath the ice. They welled up through the cold out of a numb, dark, hollow place. \'I sort of assumed we'd eventually end up going together after you asked me on a date, so I turned down Ginny. I quite liked the idea of us going together, even if I really didn't like the idea of the Yule Ball all that much. I guess that's not happening now.\'

Katie sobbed into his shoulder. The draft through the stairway turned the hot damp of her tears to a soft chill. She drew back and smeared the tears off her face with her sleeve. Mascara smudged the skin beneath her eyes, a faint redness hovered on her cheeks, and stray strands of her hair stuck to glistening patches on her face.

*That's what you get for hoping.* Harry let the numb emptiness swallow him. *It doesn't matter anyway. I'll have to die soon.*

'I hope you enjoy the Yule Ball with Roger Davies.' Harry tried to bite the rest of the words off, but they tumbled off his tongue. 'Go ahead. Tie up your hair for him. I suspect his mind's going to be on a different girl the whole time anyway.'

Katie\'s lip trembled. She whirled, and shoved her way through a group of students leaving Gryffindor Tower.

*Fuck this Yule Ball.* Harry tried to picture himself there among the gaudiness of decorations and festive cheer. *Perhaps I just won't go. If I have to die, then I might as well do what I want first. Everyone else just seems to do whatever they want.*

He turned on his heel and stalked toward the Chamber of Secrets.

Harry sat on the tip of the serpent bridge's tongue and pulled Sirius' letter out, staring at the plain seal. *What does it matter what it says?* He clawed at the emptiness, searching for something in its hollow depths.

The void gnawed back.

*It takes another little piece of me every time I'm left wishing. And it doesn't feel like there's all that much remaining.*

Harry took a deep breath and swallowed it all down. 'Read the letter. Don't dwell on stupid stuff when it's not going to matter in the end anyway.'

He scanned the untidy scrawl. *Prove them all wrong.* Deep quill scratches marred the parchment\'s surface where the letters marked the page. *Win the damn thing.*

'I'll win it. I can die after I've won.' He seized on the shard of ice in his chest, clutching at it like a lifeline. 'They can drown in my shadow. Ron, Hermione, Katie, Fleur Delacour, and all the rest of them. They'll never forget.'

*And I won't be nothing, then. Not once they've all seen me.*

He raised his wand from his sleeve and pressed the tip against the centre of Sirius\' letter. The parchment browned and burst into flames, curling upon itself and disintegrating into ash.

*Like it was never here.* He tilted his hand and let the ashes slip into the cold, dark water of the pool beneath the bridge. *As if nothing ever happened.* Harry watched them sink, clinging to the ice he felt, pushing at it every time he felt it begin to thaw. *When I die, I'll be nothing. I hope it doesn't feel like this.*

He took a deep breath and stepped into the study.

Salazar glanced up from Tom's notes. 'I may have a solution.'

A ray of hope burst through the deep, empty void. A touch of warmth like the green-inked name upon the Hogwarts letter thrust into his hand.

\'Tell me,' he whispered.

\'I believe the *piece* of Tom\'s soul must've latched onto your own in order for it to survive being in the same body as another soul. A body cannot house two souls in conflict, one must be subdued or they must coexist peacefully.\'

*Coexist like Quirrell?* Harry shuddered. *That wasn't peaceful.*

\'And that means *what* for me?\'

\'Since you are still in control of yourself and were unaware of its presence, the soul fragment must be subdued. From the notes, I surmise a connection must exist between the two souls within you. It should be possible for you to either absorb or expel it once the link is broken.\' Salazar peered down at the notes. \'There it is. True, complete remorse, the opposite intent to that which was used to fracture the soul, might reverse the effects of one, transferring and absorbing the piece back to where it belongs. I'm not sure how that would work with a fragment of another's soul, but you and Tom *are* similar...\'

\'How would I break the link?\' Harry asked.

Salazar's deep, green eyes bored into Harry. \'You would have to

fracture your soul.'

\'No. Find another way.\'

\'I tried. I knew you would not agree, so I kept searching.\'

\'You found nothing.' A wry smile spread over Harry's lips as the hope died. 'Oh well, then.'

Salazar's wand fountained green and silver sparks. \'You don't *need* to be a sacrifice! You are my heir, the last of my family that I recognise.\'

\'So I should sacrifice someone else in my place?\'

\'Someone *must* die. It can be you or someone of your choice.\' \'I will not kill to save myself.' Harry recalled the flash of green

from his dreams, his mother's begging, and all the faces from Gryffindor

Tower when his friends had turned on him. 'I won't be selfish like they all would be. I don't want to be *like them*.'

\'You can choose someone who already deserves death,\' Salazar said. \'The Killing Curse will not change its effect and you, who deserve more, do not need to be sacrificed. A single, deserving death to temporarily fracture your soul, then a moment\'s pain to rip the piece of Tom's soul out. Tell me that it's not a sacrifice worth making to preserve your life? You are a good wizard in more ways than one, your death is unnecessarily noble, be a little selfish for once. In the end, the wizarding world will profit more from your survival than your death.\'

'No.\'

'You are being foolish.'

'Am I?' Harry asked. 'Is it foolish to understand that sometimes things need to be sacrificed?'

'Don't speak to me of sacrifices.' Salazar's eyes darkened. \'I've seen and made plenty. I've learnt the hard way when to make them and when not. You let those around you feel you'll always stand by them and help them no matter what they choose. And so they choose whatever they want most, relying on *you* to make the sacrifice needed to obtain it. They should be the ones making the sacrifice to get what they want. That's what's *fair!* They exploit your nobility, your generosity, and your tenacity. *They always have.* And if you let them, they always will.\'

\'I will find others. *Equals*. They'll stand alongside me, never let me down, and never leave me alone.\'

Salazar shook his head. 'What good are equals when you know

their role is only to bury you, Harry.\'

# Dumbledore's Mistakes

Students milled back and forth through the Great Hall beneath floating candles and a cloudless, dusk sky.

Harry watched them go. *Which one would I murder to save myself? Which one would be missed the least?* His eyes flicked to Draco Malfoy. *Probably him, but even his parents and friends would miss him. I have none of either.*

'Mr Potter!\' Professor McGonagall's voice echoed down the hall. \'If

you would like to accompany me to the headmaster\'s office.\'

*I wonder what Dumbledore wants.* Harry rose from his seat and stretched the stiffness from his limbs.

Professor McGonagall's eyes roved over him. \'If you like, Mr

Potter, we can go via the tower so you can change into some fresh clothes.\'

\'It\'s okay.\' Harry transfigured his crumpled, stained robes into

crisp, clean ones. 'There, good as new.'

\'Well done. You have become much more accomplished than I realised,\' Professor McGonagall said. \'To the headmaster\'s office, then.\'

Harry glimpsed Katie hunched between Angelina and Alicia. She kept her eyes fixed on her food, but Harry heard the giggles of the three of them as he passed.

*As if nothing ever happened.* He swallowed a knotted, hot lump of emotion and smothered it. *It's like I'm not even real, just some caricature of a hero. There when needed, gone when not.*

Professor McGonagall stared the gargoyle in the eye and released a long sigh. 'Sweet crystals.' She led him up the spiral staircase.

\'Harry.\' Dumbledore gestured to the seat in front of his desk and proffered a bowl of bright, striped sweets. \'Humbug?\'

'No thanks, professor.'

Dumbledore withdrew the bowl. \'Professor McGonagall has been quite concerned about you, Harry. She overheard some of the rumours and after investigating, brought her suspicions to me. It seems nobody has seen you in some time, Harry. A few of your fellow students were quite concerned.\'

*Concerned I was up to no good, probably.*

\'Who?\'

\'Miss Granger, Mr Weasley, Miss Weasley, Miss Bell, and Mr Longbottom.\'

*All concerned for their own skins, no doubt.* A smooth, cool voice welled up from the depths of Harry's mind. *They expect me to come for revenge. The longer they wait, the more likely their fear will drive them to strike first.*

Dumbledore fixed Harry with a piercing look, his electric blue eyes as bright as gimlets. \'I am glad you have learnt more about the cloak, Harry, it's a powerful heirloom, but you should try to resist the temptation of using it. Artefacts such as your cloak carry a risk with them, becoming addicted to their use is dangerous.\'

\'I don't understand. Heirloom or not, it's still just an invisibility

cloak with a few extra enchantments.\'

Dumbledore's brow wrinkled and he pushed his half-moon spectacles up the bridge of his nose. \'What do you know about age lines, Harry?\'

them.\'

\'I assume they prevent anyone below the set age from crossing

\'Do you know how?\' \'No.\'

Dumbledore sagged and his glasses slipped down his nose. \'I

have made a mistake, it seems. There have been too many of late.\'

*Horcruxes, headmaster?* Harry crushed the faint ray of hope before it could curdle to disappointment.

\'What do you mean?\' he asked.

\'Your cloak is a very useful thing Harry. It is not a simple invisibility cloak, but a rare artefact designed to completely conceal its owner, including their magic. One of the few ways an age line can be cheated is with such an object. In conjunction with the Goblet of Fire, an object that is very hard to deceive indeed, I created a nearly perfect barrier. I\'m afraid that when your name came out, I simply assumed you'd figured out the abilities of your family heirloom and used it. I felt it was the most likely possibility, as I can conceive no other way by which your name could've been entered without my ward being broken. I am ashamed to admit, Harry, the one time in which I settled for Occam's Razor, is the one time I shouldn't have.\'

*Whose razor?*

\'I didn't use it.\' Harry recalled the headmaster's words before the Mirror of Erised and smiled a small smile. \'I don't need a cloak to become invisible, headmaster.\'

\'That is a very admirable ability, Harry.\' Dumbledore smiled and some of the lines faded from his face. \'We are two of very few wizards or

witches who attain such prowess with the Disillusionment Charm. I am glad I do not have to ask if you entered the tournament.\'

\'That is all very well, Albus, but not what I came to you about.\' Professor McGonagall\'s tone gained an extra note of stiffness.

\'I know, Minerva, but it was important, too.\'

\'I am concerned about the rumours that you have not been seen inside Gryffindor tower for a *month*, that when I asked for your whereabouts my Gryffindors, my lions, did not care about one of their own enough to find out. What is *happening* in my house?\' Professor McGonagall pursed her lips into the thin, appalled line normally reserved for Neville\'s attempts at transfiguration.

\'They don't understand. It doesn't really matter.\'

Professor McGonagall's stern expression melted. \'Is there

anything that we can do, Harry?\'

*Nothing can be done.* Harry fed the faint warmth that spread through him fade into emptiness. *And if you really cared about more than appearances, we'd've had this conversation a month ago.*

'No.'

\'Very well, Harry.\' Dumbledore poked his glasses back up his nose. \'I will do my best to discover how you have ended up in the Triwizard Tournament. Professor Moody has his suspicions, he has been telling me for weeks that the faces in his foe glass are getting closer and clearer. Is there anything else you would like to discuss, Harry? You did well in the first task, much better than anyone expected.\'

\'I'm going to win.\'

*That'll show them. See if they can make me disappear, then.*

Professor McGonagall tutted. \'Mr Potter, the Triwizard Tournament is meant to be a stern test for exceptional wizards several years older than you are.\'

A shard of ice hardened beneath Harry's ribs and crept into his veins. \'Then when I win it'll be quite the embarrassment for the other three.\'

Dumbledore gave him a small smile and selected a pink-striped humbug from the bowl on his desk. He slipped the sweet into his mouth and reached out one wizened to catch Harry's, tapping the missing thumbnail with his finger. \'I do have one more question for you, though, Harry. When did you learn to apparate?\'

\'This year,\' Harry said. \'I would've been wandless for the first task had I not.\'

\'I am not going to report you for illegal apparition,\' Dumbledore said. \'I was merely concerned you might splinch yourself more seriously next time you tried to visit Diagon Alley. It is a *very* long way to apparate. Mr Ollivander was very impressed by you and very proud of your new wand. He is an expert in both alchemy and the lore of wands, in fact, I trust his judgement on the subject implicitly. He told me your wand was not something to be concerned about and that you were a prodigious and talented pupil I had every right to feel proud of.\'

\'I won\'t be repeating my feat. It was only out of necessity that I ever attempted it.\' Harry withdrew his hand from Dumbledore\'s loose grip and tucked it into his pocket. \'As for my wand, it's no concern of anyone\'s but mine.\' He forced a bright smile onto his face.

Dumbledore shivered and paled. \'Albus?\' Professor McGonagall asked.

\'It's nothing, Minerva. I was momentarily reminded of another mistake of mine, one that I still hope to be able to correct before it is too late.\'

*Is the mistake me and my harboured horcrux*, *or Tom Riddle?*

\'No need to look so nervous Harry. There's nothing you need to worry about except the Triwizard Tournament. You have your OWLs next year, too and I expect you to perform quite spectacularly on them.\'

*So I don't need to die for another year and a half at least. If he's not lying.* Harry studied Dumbledore's expression. *He doesn't seem to be. He's no reason to lie, anyway. He doesn't know I know.*

\'You can return to your studies or to trying to discover the clue to

the second task, Harry,' Dumbledore said.

Harry pushed himself out of his chair and descended the staircase.

*I have at least a year or so left. I'll have to make the most of it.*

The corridors grew quiet and empty as he made his way up toward the Room of Requirement.

A hand grabbed him by the shoulder and slammed him into the wall. Pain flared up down his side and Harry's glasses slipped off his nose and skittered across the floor.

\'So this is where you slither off to,\' Ron snapped, shoving him against the wall. \'I told you you\'d pay. Nobody hurts my little sister, not even you.\'

'Would you have liked it better if I'd lied to her?\' Harry sneered at the red and black blur before his eyes and straightened his sleeve, letting his wand slip into his palm. \'Don't make excuses. If I'd done something out of order to Ginny, Fred and George would be here, but you're all by yourself. You're doing this because you *want* to get at me, not for Ginny.\'

'She was crying because of *you*,\' Ron snarled. \'And I'm *not* alone, Dean and Seamus are here too.\'

\'Are they?\' Harry peered at the blurs. \'Can't even see them without my glasses. I assume the real reason Dean's upset is because your sister would rather spend her Christmas with me than him.\'

\'At least I\'ll be going with *someone*,' Dean jibed. \'Everyone knows

Katie Bell ditched you for Roger Davies.\'

*Roger Davies doesn't even care about her.* Harry smothered every ounce of feeling. *She's going to have a miserable night watching him stare at Fleur Delacour.*

\'So what now?\' he asked. \'Are we going to have a pleasant conversation?\'

Someone shoved his glasses back onto his face and things swam back into focus. Ron and Dean glowered from the corridor. Seamus let go of him and stepped back.

\'We\'re going to hex you so badly you\'ll be in the hospital wing for a week,\' Dean growled, raising his wand. 'See if you're such an arrogant prat, then!'

'At least I won\'t have to worry about the Yule Ball.' Harry flicked

his wand up and directed a weak blasting curse to his left.

A red flash struck Dean on the shoulder and hurled him against the wall with a loud crack. Ron threw himself to the floor.

'Expelliarmus!' Ron jabbed his wand out.

Harry sidestepped the red beam and swept his wand sideways, banishing Seamus into a suit of armour. His wand bounced away across the floor.

Ron froze.

\'Perhaps you should've brought a few more friends,' Harry said.

Ron raised his wand. \'You used a *Blasting Curse* on Dean!'

Harry disarmed him and volleyed Ron's wand down the corridor. \'It wasn\'t powerful. You all deserved worse for trying to ambush me. You wanted to step out of my shadow and be seen as yourselves instead of being my friends. I gave you that chance when I left you alone.\'

'We apologised!' Ron turned crimson. 'We said we were sorry!

*You* were the one who didn't want to be friends!'

*You betrayed me. Of course I didn't want to trust you again.* Harry flicked his wand.

Ron disappeared under black ropes, bound from head to toe. He squirmed, muffled shouts emanating from beneath his bonds, clawing at his mouth with covered fingers.

Harry sliced a hole over Ron's mouth and glanced at his wand. *That spell came out stronger than I intended. I guess my heart must've been in it.*

'What did you think was going to happen?' he demanded. 'You'd jelly-legs me and I'd be overcome with remorse and forgive you for turning on me?'

Ron squirmed and writhed. 'I wanted to take you down a peg or two! You think you're so much better than us all now, just because you had a whole summer to read a couple of books.'

'It was quite a few books, actually.' Harry ripped the ropes off his face with a flick of his wand. 'Did you think about *why* I have the whole

summer to do nothing but read, Ron? Or were you so busy celebrating the

murder of my family with pumpkins and sweets that you forgot?'

'Oh bugger off.' Ron grunted, the tips of his ears turning pink. 'You can't even remember them, how bad can it be?'

'Bugger off?' A little cold spark settled beneath his ribs. 'You don't understand at all, do you? None of you do. Not even Hermione.'

'Yeah, mate, it's real hard for us to understand why you've suddenly turned into such an absolute dick.' Ron glowered through the ropes. 'So what if we forgot about Halloween? You forget stuff, too.'

\'I do.' He hardened his heart, letting the cold swell through him and trickle into his veins. 'But you just end up repeating your mistakes if you forget them. Like you, enviously lashing out at Hermione in first year because she was better than you at magic and now enviously lashing out at me because I ended up in the death trap tournament you're stupid enough to think will be great.'

Ron's lip curled. 'I'm not jealous, we all just realised you're a lying

twat.'

Harry turned on his heel and slammed the door to the Room of

Requirement behind him. *If they attack me again, I'll have to be harsher.* His thoughts bubbled up from the base of his skull in a smooth, high voice.

*Otherwise, eventually, they'll manage to hurt me.*

He pulled the Marauders' map out and traced their names. Ron, Seamus, and Dean headed toward Gryffindor tower and Peter Pettigrew's name lingered near the quidditch pitch.

*Soon.* Harry watched it until it vanished. *I should clear Sirius'*

*name before I have to die, since nobody else seems to want to bother.*

# Tinder-wood

The bared fangs and sharp tongues of the serpent effigies threw short, sharp shadows over the floor of Salazar's chamber. The vast coil of the basilisk stretched across the stone; its maw gaped, the lower jaw melted into a thick, viscous red pool.

\'Why are you still trying to get stronger?\' Salazar fixed Harry with

a searching look. 'What's the point?'

\'I need to be more powerful.' Harry raised an eyebrow at Salazar. 'There're still some things I can do in the next year. I don't want to vanish when I die. I don't want to disappear.'

\'For someone so set on dying, you seem remarkably reluctant to accept what it is.\' Salazar stroked his chin. 'To die *is* to become nothing. Your parents sacrificed their lives for you. You will always remember them, but they're gone. They don't know you love them. They can't know. They're nothing.'

\'I do not *want* to die!\' Harry clenched his teeth. Cold rage flooded his veins and ebbed into the numb, hollow void gnawing at his heart. \'I want to live. I want my dreams. I want my *hope*. I want my wishes to come true. But I can't.\'

'Why not?' Salazar tickled the chin of his snake. 'What is less valuable about your life than the one you'd have to trade for it? You're my heir, an exceptional wizard, and no average murderer or criminal could ever do more for the world than you will if you live.'

'It's not about that. I know I'm more likely to do good things for

the world than someone like Peter Pettigrew---' 'Then what is it about?'

'It's about all of *them!*' Harry thrust his wand up at the castle above. Ice swirled through his blood like a snowstorm through a forest and faded into the emptiness like whispers into the night. 'All the Ron's, Hermione's, Voldemort's, and Dumbledore's.'

'What about them?' Salazar's dark green eyes bored through Harry's. 'Because they judge you for not living up to their unrealistic perception of you?'

'Yes.' He sagged. 'They want me to turn up and be perfect when they need me, then vanish the rest of the time so they don't feel bad they can't hold themselves to the same standards they hold me.'

'You're letting their delusions warp your perception of yourself.' Salazar pointed his wand at Harry's chest. 'You know what anyone else would do in your shoes, yet you try to be what they think you are instead. *That's* what you're dying for Harry. It's not stopping Tom. It's not saving lives. It's their foolish belief that you're some kind of hero and your pride at being better than the ones who turned against you.'

Harry drew himself up. 'I won't give them the satisfaction of dragging me down to their level. They can drown in my shadow, real or not.'

\'Riddle stands at one selfish extreme, you at the selfless other!

See the middle ground! Walk it! Don\'t throw away your life because you\'re paranoid of emulating your predecessor.\'

\'Voldemort is *not* my predecessor,\' Harry hissed.

\'He was my heir, once. He is, without a doubt, distant family of yours. Do not delude yourself into thinking he is some personification of evil you must avoid emulating.\' Parseltongue bled into Salazar's speech. \'I will tell you of the Tom I knew.\'

He glowered at the painting. 'Tell me then.'

\'A boy came into this chamber, thin, ragged and alone. A child who dreamt of becoming something great enough to be remembered, to protect the few who'd protected him. He was family, my heir and my legacy, so I offered him my help. As the years passed, he withdrew within himself, cut off from the few he had trusted one by one. Albus Dumbledore threw him back to the muggles that loathed him without a second thought for his well-being, the students avoided him, not wanting to be dragged into his spiral to self-destruction. Within this chamber he learnt he had the ability to be something great and found the determination to seize it. He swore he would never look back.\'

\'You said you'd tell me about Tom. Not *me*.\' \'I am.\'

Harry blanched, a shiver trembling down his spine.

\'Did you think you were so different?\' Salazar's voice softened to near a whisper. \'Even accounting for the effect of the soul fragment, the two of you would've been similar. I've said little about it because I knew you wouldn't want to listen, but I'll not stay silent while you throw your life away.\'

*If we're so similar, will I just end up like him?*

'The world doesn't need or want a second Lord Voldemort.\' \'Don\'t be a fool,\' Salazar snapped. \'You're a hundred times worse

than Godric sometimes. It took Rowena and I a month to convince him the first time he killed some child-murdering witch that he was still a good person and a good wizard. You stand here with only noble intentions and speak about dying before you become a dark wizard. Did you not listen when I explained to you the principles of magic?\'

\'There is no light and dark, only power and the intent that directs

it.'

\'Then there's nothing that needs to be said. You are like him, but you are not him. I am sure I am not the only one who sees the similarity. Dumbledore must as well, Tom often spoke of the man as something akin to an idol.\'

\'He does.\' Dumbledore's pale face swam among Harry's thoughts. 'He definitely does.'

\'And has he ever shown any concern that you might become another Voldemort? He may be raising you to sacrifice, keeping you alive until your death suits him best, but he still knows that the two of you are different.\' Salazar straightened up and folded his arms. \'The two of you are apples, fallen far apart, but from the same tree.\'

*I suppose that's better than some of his metaphors.*

\'It still changes nothing. I have to die or Voldemort will eventually find a way to return and many more will suffer.\'

\'The horcrux that anchors him has to be destroyed,\' Salazar said. \'You do not have to die for that to happen.\'

'But I'd have to kill. To stop Voldemort, I'd have to take a

dangerously large step toward becoming him.\'

\'Your soul will heal over time,\' Salazar murmured. 'As long as your

intentions do not shift down a darker path, your soul will mend.\'

'Without that *darker intent* I won't be able to cast the killing curse

to save myself in the first place.\' Harry sighed. 'Enough of this, Salazar. You're just twisting the knife, wasting your time and what little time I have left. My mind isn't going to be changed.'

\'So you say,\' Slytherin muttered. 'Tom said similar things. His friends would be disappointed, he said. His dead parents might not understand, he told me. His equals would stand with him, he'd say. One by

one, those trusted, treasured people proved they were loyal to themselves first and foremost. They chose to be selfish, refused to understand, and to not stand with him. Afterward, he withdrew. Tom didn't leave everyone behind to become Voldemort. They tore themselves free of him and Voldemort was forged from what was left.\'

*How could it be worse than it is?* Harry shuddered. *Nothing's worse than this endless empty feeling. I wake up with it every morning and yearn for the moment I can just fall asleep again.*

\'I've nothing left to lose,' he said.

*As long as dying is really like sleeping.* Harry's heart shrank into the cold, sick pit of his stomach and he swallowed a stab of fear. *If you can feel the emptiness of dying forever, then I can't even escape it by sleeping.*

'If you say so.\' Salazar tossed his wand back and forth between his hands as it sputtered silver sparks. 'Let's spend this time on something more productive, then. Have you made any progress with anything else?'

Harry cast the Disillusionment Charm on himself.

\'You mastered it.' Salazar nodded. 'Excellent. What about the

rest?'

\'Papilionis,\' Harry whispered.

Black butterflies swarmed from the tip of his wand, swirling

around Harry and Salazar in a demi-sphere of whirring wings.

\'The butterflies,\' Salazar groused. \'What was wrong with conjuring snakes? A proper heir of Slytherin would conjure serpents, not girly insects. I can almost hear my wife and daughter laughing at me in the afterlife.\'

A brief thrill of amusement caught the corner of Harry's lips and curved them upward, then it faded into the deep numbness inside him. Harry transfigured a butterfly to a razor-edged shard of steel and flicked it forward.

It screeched off the nose of a serpent effigy and skittered past the

edge of Salazar's frame. Harry covered the chamber in a flurry of steel. They clattered across the floor and off the walls, leaving a myriad of small scratches upon the basilisk's skin.

\'Stop that!\' Salazar glowered at the pieces of steel littering the chamber. 'I do *not* need holes in my canvas. There's barely enough room in here for me as it is with this wretched snake wriggling around.'

'I'm done.' Harry dispelled his butterflies and strewn projectiles into wisps of black smoke. 'Well, apart from the basilisk spell. I'd like to try that again. It seems like a good last resort spell.'

\'Not from the water,\' Salazar said.

Harry quirked an eyebrow. 'What should I use as a medium, then?' \'The air. If you can conjure it effectively from nothing but air, you'll

have a far more versatile and dangerous spell. A good duellist will be wary of water or fire nearby, or anything their opponent might use against them, but people always overlook the air surrounding them.\'

Harry shrugged. 'Why not.'

\'Don\'t look so sceptical,\' Salazar snapped. \'I don\'t want you to give it flesh, blood, and scales, coalesce it from the air, use your emotions as a focus and give it form from the element just as you've always done.\'

*Easier said than done.* Harry clawed at the emptiness for some scrap of feeling, picturing the fangs and maw striking out of nothing, just as they'd lunged from the common room heart.

He slashed his wand forward.

A blur flashed across the chamber and the tongue bridge shattered like glass, spraying pieces across the pool.

\'Never listen to my suggestions again,\' Salazar murmured, his serpent cowering behind his neck, flicking its tongue at a piece of bridge lodged in the edge of the frame. 'That's nothing like what I was expecting.\'

Harry waved his wand. The pieces of bridge rose from the water and the tongue reformed over the pool.

'What were you expecting?' he asked.

'I expected a translucent serpent similar to the water based one, but that certainly wasn't it.\' Salazar stroked his chin. 'Usually, it's the emotion of the focus that warps a spell. What feeling did you use the first time you cast it? When you killed that wizard?'

Harry cast his mind back. 'Anger. I was angry.' 'And this time?'

'Nothing. I didn't feel anything.' Harry shrugged. 'I don't feel much of anything anymore.'

*The emptiness. It was the emptiness.*

\'Nothing\...' Salazar frowned, a shadow flitting through his green eyes. 'I think you made it a vacuum, a concentrated absence of air. It imploded, rather than exploded.' He grinned. 'Marvellous. I\'ve never seen anything like it. No simple shield charm will stop a spell like that.'

\'I can test it, if you like.'

\'Not in the chamber,\' Salazar hissed. \'Go and ruin the Room of Requirement instead.\'

Harry picked the painting up and carried it back to its spot in the study. \'I should eat.\'

'I'm not surprised you're hungry after that.'

'I'm not hungry.' Harry patted his stomach. 'I've not been hungry

for a few days. I need to eat, though.'

'You fell out with that girl a few days ago.' Salazar's eyes darkened. 'Make sure you eat, Harry. You need the energy.'

'I know.'

Harry found the tables of the Great Hall piled with pumpkin pasties. *Urgh. What terrible luck. What is this school's obsession with pumpkin? Did Dumbledore stumble into muggle Halloween once and fall in love with pumpkins and sweets?*

He took a seat at the very end and peeled the pastry off the soft, orange mush, forcing down a few mouthfuls.

The bench shifted beside him.

*Please don't be Katie.* Harry stared at his plate and stifled a deep sigh. *Maybe they'll go away if I ignore them.*

\'Harry.\' Hermione nudged his shoulder.

*Ah, the only person I might want to talk to less than Katie, of*

*course.*

\'Hello, Hermione.\' \'Where have you been?\'

'That's a strange way to apologise for breaking my wand,' he said.

\'I *already* said I was sorry, Harry. I didn\'t mean to break it, you *know* that. I'd been practising the charm and it was the first thing in my head when I cast. I know you loved your wand, but it *was* an accident.\'

\'If you didn\'t come to apologise, then why did you come?\'

*Just leave me alone.* He smothered a sigh and soft twist of pain in his chest. *I just want to be alone.*

\'We\'re worried about you,\' she whispered. \'You\'ve been so different since the World Cup.\'

\'I\'ve heard your theories. You might be interested to know that Dumbledore believes I didn't put my name in the tournament. Pass that along to Ron, he can tell Dean next time he visits the hospital wing.\'

\'How did you know about Dean getting hurt? Ron said not to tell

anyone.'

Harry twisted round and studied the glint in her brown eyes.

\'What else did he say?\'

\'That Dean\'s collarbone got broken in a fight on the seventh floor. He was really angry about it, but I had drag things out of him, so whatever was going on must've been bad.\'

\'That was it? He didn\'t mention they all tried to ambush me

together up there?'

\'No.\' Hermione shook her head and gasped. \'You broke Dean\'s

*collarbone*, Harry!\'

*If they'd not attacked me, nothing would've happened to them.*

\'He started it.' Harry shoved the remnants of his pumpkin pasty

away. 'Should I have just let them hurt me, instead? Is that better?'

Hermione chewed at her lip, spinning her empty goblet round and round on the table. \'I heard about Katie,\' she murmured.

Harry shot her a flat stare. \'That\'s good. You\'re probably the only person who has and I *really* wanted to discuss it with you.\'

Hermione flinched.

'We aren't friends anymore. You broke my wand, pretty much the most precious thing I owned. And *before* you start saying it was an accident again, let me remind you the whole reason you cast that spell in the first place was because you couldn't accept I might be as good at something as you.\'

\'I could accept it!'

\'I\'m glad that's the only part of my statement you wanted to contest,\' Harry snapped. \'Because I\'m not sure I could've kept my temper if you\'d tried to convince me we could still be friends.\'

She crossed her arms and released a short huff. \'I don\'t know what's happened to you, Harry. You're being very unreasonable and irrational.\'

'Really? You've no idea what happened?' Harry's lip curled. 'That's strange, given you've been involved *every time.*'

Hermione threw her legs out from under the table and stomped

away.

*Just leave me alone.* Harry watched her bag recede into the

crowd. *You disappeared when I needed you, don't come back now I don't.*

Laughter burst from the far end of the hall. Harry risked a glance

and glimpsed Ron's red hair.

\'No.\' A cold, French-accented voice cut through the laughter like a knife. \'Not if you were the last male in this entire school.\'

*Ah*, *the charming Fleur Delacour is still struggling with getting a date to the Yule Ball.* Harry watched out of the corner of his eye as she strode through the tables, followed by the crowd. *I bet she just wants to be left alone, too.*

A crimson-faced, mortified Ron slunk out of the crowd.

*Ron actually asked her.* A laugh burst from his lips. *They literally couldn't be more unsuited for each other. She's elegant and clever and he's, well, not that at all.*

Ron rounded on him like a wounded bull. \'I don\'t know what you find funny, Potter. I\'m just as successful as you are and you have to open the ceremony.\'

*True. I do.* Harry's cheer faded. *Thanks for reminding me, Ron.*

\'No wonder Katie dumped you.\' Ron sneered. \'You don\'t even have the courage to ask anyone. Explains why you can\'t bear to show your face around Gryffindor Tower. There\'s no room for cowards in the house of the brave.\'

A shard of ice formed in Harry's chest. \'I don\'t care about the Yule Ball. Since you\'re so obsessed with the limelight, you can polyjuice as me and take Hermione.\' He spied Dean across the hall and let a small smile slip onto his face. \'You\'ll only have to deal with your little sister making eyes at you the entire time.\'

Ron spluttered. 'As if---'

\'Alternatively, you could do something to try and make yourself known in your own right, Ron. Have you thought about asking Fleur Delacour to the Yule Ball?\' Harry's smile spread into a grin. \'I\'m sure she

wouldn\'t be *too* scathing in her response, not when there are so many people around to witness your humiliation.\'

\'As if I'd ever lower myself to act like you,\' Ron yelled. \'You don\'t even have the courage to ask anyone to the ball, let alone *Fleur Delacour*.\' Her name slipped out in a quiet, reverent whisper.

Harry burst into laughter. \'I don\'t even want to go, let alone with *her*. Besides, she has so many fans I wouldn\'t have time to finish my lunch if I wanted to join the queue and ask.\'

*Although, if by some miracle she said yes, it'd certainly teach*

*Roger Davies a lesson.*

A tense, thick silence settled over the hall and Ron's face turned crimson as the eyes of everyone in the hall focused on them. Distinct clear steps rang out across the floor of the hall from his left. Harry's heart slipped somewhere down below his stomach.

\'So, you find *this* funny, too.\' Fleur Delacour's soft voice emanated

from just behind him.

Her tone reminded Harry very much of the eyes of the Hungarian Horntail and a primitive instinct to remain still seized him.

*Oh, bloody hell. I'm about to get murdered by an angry French witch in front of everyone.* A chuckle slipped from his mouth. *Well, at least that's one horcrux gone.*

Soft, strong fingers caught his chin and turned his head round. The faint, sharp, sweet scent of burnt holly and marzipan drifted to Harry's nose.

A pair of narrowed blue eyes met his, as bright and clear as a summer sky.

\'I think *you* will make a good date to the Yule Ball,\' Fleur said.

*She's used to getting what she wants, but I'd rather not be subjected to even more of the school's envy.* Harry struggled for words, but caught sight of Roger Davies' horrified face in the crowd. *On second thought...*

\'I agree.\' He pulled a bright smile onto his lips.

Fleur's lips curved. 'Of course you do.'

\'Good.\' She let go of his chin and flicked her long, silver hair back over her shoulder. \'Tomorrow is Christmas Eve,\' she murmured. \'I will meet you at the Owlery as we met before, so we can take a day to get to know each other a little before the Yule Ball.\'

*She wants to explain.* Harry nodded and gave her a thumbs up.

*Maybe she can explain the whole Katie thing. Maybe I should apologise for laughing at Ron bothering her.*

'Perfect.' Fleur Delacour turned on her heel in a swirl of silver hair. 'If anyone else wants to ask me to the Yule Ball, the answer will obviously be no. Do not waste my time unless you *want* to be cursed.'

# Strictly Come What?

Bird droppings and dust covered the beams. A sour must stung Harry's nose. Owls snoozed among the rafters, huddled away from the slim rays of light that pierced through the cracks of loose tiles and shutters.

*Very romantic.* Harry caught the faint sound of footsteps and edged away from the door, casting the disillusionment charm. *Not really how I would've pictured a date, if I'd done much picturing, but then again, it's not a date, is it?*

\'That is an even better disillusionment charm.\' Fleur Delacour stepped into the owlery. Her wand rested in her hand. Her eyes fixed on Harry.

The corner of Harry's mouth twitched. \'How did you notice?\'

Fleur Delacour tilted her chin into the air. \'I am aware of the weaknesses of the charm.\' A soft smile crept onto her lips.

\'I suppose I owe you an apology for laughing back in the Great

Hall---'

\'I would rather know why you thought it was funny.' Harry shrugged. \'I was laughing at Ron.'

Fleur Delacour's eyes narrowed. \'And the first time?\' 'First time?' he asked.

'When you were with that dark-haired girl and I was being

*accosted* by boys.' Her summer sky blue eyes focused on a point somewhere in the centre of Harry's head. 'You laughed at me. I do not like being laughed at.'

'Katie said something funny.\' Harry suppressed a thin smile. 'I wasn't paying too much attention to what was happening in the hall. I was in my own little bubble, I'm afraid.'

\'Ah.\' Something flickered through her blue eyes. \'Then consider my company tomorrow an apology for overreacting. I thought you were laughing at me.\'

*A poor apology.* His thoughts came in a familiar, smooth, high voice. *She's not doing it for me and she has a very high opinion of her company, too.*

\'If it were an apology, I wouldn't accept it,' Harry said. 'But your part in destroying my relationship with Katie was much smaller than everyone else\'s anyway. You were just the catalyst. She'd've done something like it eventually.\'

Fleur Delacour studied the ceiling. \'It is destroyed?\'

'I think so.' He sighed. 'It certainly won't be the same. I've firewhiskey and Roger Davies to thank for that. And the two of us, of course, though mostly me.'

'More her.' Fleur's eyes didn't leave the ceiling. 'She had every right to be angry with *me,* but it was obvious that you had no idea what was going on. Perhaps it is for the best it is over, but if it is not, well, the more it hurts to win, the more satisfying it is.'

*Perhaps.* Harry took a deep breath. *I still shouldn't have defended*

*you. Salazar would say I was trying to live up to unfair expectations again.*

\'Shall we go?\' Fleur asked. \'This tower smells worse than I remembered.\'

\'Where would be better?\' Harry followed her down the stairs,

keeping his distance. 'The Great Hall?'

A soft, gentle laugh left Fleur's lips. 'Are you hoping to twist the knife in Roger Davies\' heart or that other girl's?' She dallied for a step, closing the gap between them. 'If we see them, perhaps I will let you hold me close for a moment.'

Harry's skin prickled as the warmth of her skin washed over his. He paused in his stride until she was a few steps ahead. 'Thanks, but no thanks. I'd rather avoid spending too long in the hall with you.'

\'I might think of somewhere else as we walk, though I admit I am not fond of Hogwarts. It is cold, grey and wet.\' Fleur took a long route back to the castle, one that avoided passing by Beauxbatons' carriage.

Harry glanced at the cold, clear winter sky as they entered the castle. 'I think that's just Britain. We get a few good days in summer, but the rest of the year's a toss up between overcast or raining.'

Fleur's smile reappeared, then faded. \'I hope you do not think less of me for using you as a shield, Harry.'

\'A shield?\'

\'I'm a veela. I attract a lot of attention. If I could, I would not attend this Yule Ball at all, but having a date capable of keeping his wits is far preferable to the alternative and it will ward off most of the others who would pester me for dances.\'

They stepped through the doors into the Great Hall. Heads swivelled in their direction.

Harry chuckled. \'I don't know who they're staring at now.'

\'I do.\' Fleur sniffed and turned up her nose. 'Look at them. So weak-willed. The slightest touch of my magic and they lose themselves. Most of them do not even *try* to resist. They hope I am trying to charm them and just *let* it enthral them.'

Harry noticed the glazed look in their eyes. \'I know somewhere

most people don't?'

Fleur stepped into his space, brushing his arm with her shoulder.

\'We can go there.'

*Why's she doing that?* Harry's stomach shifted and the hairs on his skin prickled. *Why won't she stop doing that?*

Harry led her to the seventh floor. 'I've never brought anyone here before, you know. You weren't the first person I'd've expected it to be, either.'

Fleur blinked and swept her silver hair over her shoulder. 'Non?

Not even your friends or Katie Bell?'

'Not even them.' Harry gestured at the blank space of wall opposite Hogwarts\' worst tapestry. 'This is the Room of Requirement.'

Fleur pulled her wand out and closed her eyes. 'Hmmm, I cannot sense any magic.' She narrowed her blue eyes. 'If you were anyone else, I would suspect you were about to try something that would result in me cursing you *very* harshly.'

*Why am I different? Because I'm supposed to be a hero?* Harry bit his tongue.

\'Imagine the room you want to be in,\' he said. \'The Room of Requirement will provide. It has to adhere to the laws of magic, though, so no food and so forth.\'

A slender, elegant door appeared. A light shade of blue paint covered everything but the metal handle and silver runes glowed in small circles across its surface.

\'How ingenious.' Fleur twisted her wand round with white- knuckled fingers. \'I suppose we should go in.\'

A neat silver and blue blanketed bed sat amongst packed bookshelves. Stacks of tomes towered from the ivory carpet to where an elegant crystal flower glowed with gentle, white light. Dozens of tiny, enchanted items ornamented both shelves and stacks and two silver- haired girls smiled and laughed in the photo beside her bed. Two pairs of bright eyes shone from the frame: one set of summer sky, the other storm grey.

'Gabby.' Fleur's blue eyes tightened behind a veil of silver hair. 'Ma petite sœur --- my little sister.'

*But nobody else.* Harry glanced round the room. *Just you, and her, and all these books and trinkets to fill the time.*

'You can change the room from within,' he murmured. \'Merci.'

The ceiling shifted into a high, arched vault, long, tall windows of thin glass stretching down either side. Harry gazed out through them at mountains and a sparse woodland of gnarled, short pine trees.

\'Beauxbatons\' Gallery,\' Fleur said. \'We have no Great Hall, only an open forum. When winter comes, this is where large groups gather.\'

\'I can understand why you don't find Hogwarts attractive.\'

\'It is not as beautiful a place, but we do not have a room such as

this.\'

*I think that's the only compliment I've heard from you.*

Fleur twisted her heel back and forth on the floor. \'Tell me, Harry.

Do you know how to dance?\'

\'No.\' Harry's gut churned and the hairs on the nape of his neck prickled like mad. 'I've never been all that keen to be the centre of attention.'

*But I'm always stuck there, just like I'll be stuck dancing at the*

*Yule Ball.*

Music began to drift from the corner of the room.

*She must really want to dance.* Harry hid his grimace. *Because I really don't want to dance and I'm fairly sure the room just picks the strongest desire from the two of us.*

\'My date will have to dance. I will *not* be laughed at by everyone.

If you can dodge a dragon, you can avoid standing on my feet.' Fleur stepped in close to him, her breath brushing against his chin and a sweet, sharp scent catching Harry's nose. 'You just need to learn the steps... and *voila!\'*

Harry froze. His heart picked up, thudding against his ribs like a prisoner's fist against the bars of their jail. 'I suppose I've no choice if we're opening the Yule Ball.'

Fleur studied him with a strange gleam in her eyes. \'You *really* do not like the closeness, do you?\'

*No.* The music drifted on, a cheerful, fast-paced assault on Harry's

ears. *I don't see why everyone always has to get so close to everyone else.*

\'No.' He took a step back from her. 'I don't.'

She measured the gap between them with her eyes. 'Are you

afraid? Or just not used to it?'

Harry frowned. 'Does it matter? It makes me very uncomfortable.'

Fleur's expression softened. \'I can try and alleviate your discomfort, if you like. You won't feel it so much if you pay attention to me and let my magic guide your thoughts.\'

*Her magic. The allure.*

\'I'll be fine.\' He twisted his face into a bright smile.

Fleur\'s eyes narrowed and she reached out, taking his hands and drawing him close against her. \'These are the steps,' she murmured, her breath washing over his cheek in a rush of burnt holly leaves.

Harry focused on the placement of her feet, the tug of her hands, the rhythm of the steps, and the beat of the music. He pictured the circle of black ink on its pale page and clung to its image, trying to let himself drown in its dark. His heart ceased its pounding, but Fleur's presence in his arms burnt against his skin like a branding iron and a small sigh slipped from his slips.

Fleur's lips quirked. \'Do you know how many boys there are within

these walls who would like to take your place?\'

'I'm not them.' Harry mustered a grin. 'What about girls, too? I'm sure there are probably a few of them who'd be envious.'

Fleur smothered a small smile. \'No. I suppose you are not them.' She guided him across the room in step with the music. 'You know, Harry, you remind me of a girl I used to know.'

*A friend?* Harry recalled the lone picture frame in her room as Fleur spun beneath his arm. *Does she have any friends? Or maybe it's her little sister?*

'What was she like?'

'Lonely. Busy parents and no real friends.'

Harry half-stifled a flinch. 'Just lonely?'

Fleur pulled his hand back to her waist and favoured him with the soft smile he'd glimpsed next to Gabrielle\'s. 'No. She was different. Better. Envied. Hated. In the end, being perfect was all she had left and winning was the only way to prove it. But you know a little about that now, do you not, Harry?'

'It does sound a bit familiar.' Harry forced the brightness back into his smile and stretched his lips into a wide curve. 'I---'

\'Do not smile at me like that.' Fleur dragged their dance to a halt. 'I do not share myself readily, Harry. Do not --- do not treat it like it means nothing and act like I am *them*.'

Guilt chewed at his gut. \'Sorry.'

The music faded away.

'Why did you ask me to be your date?' Harry asked.

'I have to go with someone.' Fleur weighed her words as if they were made of gold. 'You and I are not so different.'

*So the girl is her.* Harry felt things fall into place. *She thinks like Salazar does.*

\'Similar enough, I suppose. Fleur Delacour is seen through a rose- tinted lens. I fall underneath my own shadow.\'

Fleur tossed her hair back over her shoulders and smoothed it

down with both hands. \'I am glad your name came out of the goblet now.'

\'You are?\' Harry grinned. \'You might change your mind when you come second.\'

A small smile curved Fleur's lips. 'I will come first. As always.' She stepped back from him. 'You did not enter, did you?\'

\'No.\' Harry sighed. \'Things like this always seem to happen to me.\' \'Do you know how an age line works?\'

\'Professor Dumbledore explained it to me a little. It detects the age of your magic.\'

Fleur shook her head. \'That is a very basic explanation. Still, nobody younger than seventeen could have crossed the line, so you could not have entered your own name.\'

Harry laughed. \'You believed me all this time? Who'd've guessed?\'

\'Albus Dumbledore is too powerful to have one of his wards broken by any student, you could not have crossed.\' Fleur's smile faded to a frown. 'Do you know how the Goblet of Fire works?'

'It selects names.\'

She laughed. \'It selects the best possible candidate of the names it accepts from a list of criteria chosen by its creator, but, most importantly, it cannot be lied to. If I tried to put another\'s name in, I would fail. I might regret it, too. The goblet is old, old enough to carry some vicious curses.\'

\'So nobody but me could have put my name in.\' Harry's stomach plummeted. 'But I can't have put my name in because of the ward, so that doesn't make any sense.'

\'Nobody who was not called Harry Potter and was above the age of seventeen, but such a scheme is far-fetched and seems unlikely.\'

*I've come across some pretty far-fetched schemes here, but I think*

*I'm probably the only Harry Potter nearby.*

'My cloak's not been missing, either.\' Harry scowled. 'But then how did my name come out at all?'

\'Your cloak?\' Fleur's smile reappeared. \'An invisibility cloak cannot

conceal you from an age line, Harry. Your friends are wrong.\'

\'My former friends are more right than they realise. My cloak's an heirloom capable of bypassing the line, my godfather said so, and Dumbledore confirmed it.\'

Fleur blinked. 'I would very much like to see this cloak, if you do not mind.'

\'It's one of the very few things I've left of my parents, I'm afraid.' Harry sighed. 'Dumbledore assumed I used it.\'

'If I had known about it, so would I.' She pursed her lips. 'You are not going to like this, Harry. Albus Dumbledore made it impossible for anyone to enter you, but *he* still read your name out...\'

Ice lanced through Harry's chest and down his spine, swirling through his blood like a hurricane. *Every year, I encounter danger at Hogwarts under the nose of Albus Dumbledore. Every year, I almost die. He\'s been trying to destroy his accidental horcrux from the very beginning!*

The deep, hollow numb consumed his fury, washing it away like a

sandcastle in the tide. 'Huh. Well, I\'m sure he'll be overjoyed when I win.'

\'When you come second.\' A small smile played around the corners of Fleur\'s mouth.

\'We\'ll see.'

\'Have you progressed anywhere with your egg?\'

*Not at all.* Harry kept a straight face. *I should really do something about that.*

\'I solved it a few days ago,' he said.

\'What solution did you come up with? I thought your plan for the first task was quite ingenious. A simple charm and plan, you solved the problem and gave away little of your ability.\'

Harry laughed. \'If I told you, I'd rather undermine my chances, wouldn't I?\'

\'I suppose that is true.\' Fleur's delicate eyebrows arched into a gentle vee. \'I will not be able to convince you that I have already found one of my own and am just interested?\'

\'You might. I don\'t think you\'d lie to me, but I still won\'t be able to

tell you.\'

*Mainly because I have no idea what the clue is.*

\'Caution is to be admired,\' Fleur said. \'I am not offended. I am fond

of winning. If I needed a solution to a problem, I might well try to pry some details out of you.\'

\'Do you know if either Cedric or Viktor have figured it out?\'

\'Why would I know?\' Fleur smoothed her uniform and took a seat on a chair that appeared beneath her. 'I have barely spoken to either of them.'

\'You knew about my cloak.'

Fleur's smile didn't waver. 'I was curious about my competition. However, as far as I know, neither of them have done anything more than decipher the clue. I would assume Viktor Krum at least has a plan, though, since he has started spending a lot of time in Hogwarts' library.\'

\'You don\'t seem very worried about them.'

\'Cedric Diggory is an exceptional student and clearly a talented wizard, but he has overestimated himself by entering this tournament. He simply lacks the same will to win that we have. Viktor Krum knows what it means to win, but is not one for planning. Igor Karkoroff can only compensate for that so much.\'

\'And me?\'

\'Young, but prodigious and powerful, with a will strong enough to win it, and capable of cunning.\' She patted him on the shoulder. \'You will make a very good runner-up, Harry.\'

Harry pointed at her hair. \'I think silver's more your colour than mine, Fleur.'

\'The Triwizard Tournament trophy is silver, Harry.'

*So it is.*

\'What about you?\' Harry asked. 'What makes you better?'

\'I am more complete than any of my rivals save perhaps you, but my experience is greater than yours and I am just as talented. Provided the tasks do not exploit my natural weaknesses too much, I will win.\'

\'You're very confident.'

*I wonder what her natural weaknesses are? Something to do with*

*veela?*

\'I take pride in winning and being the best at my school, Harry. It

has been a long time since I have failed at something I have competed in. You will be just the same, if you are not already.\' She raised a finger. \'Do not mistake my pride as a dismissal of others, though. I may be better than most, but I still respect talent and have my own equals and betters in turn. Even if I have not met them among our peers.\'

'So modest,' Harry quipped.

\'I think I should return to the carriage now.\' Fleur rose from her seat and paused a few steps from the door. \'I should warn you there are those, amongst Beauxbatons\' students at least, who believe I have *charmed* you into going with me after stealing you from your previous girlfriend. If your school is anything like mine, those rumours will spread.\'

\'I don't care.' He offered her a grin. 'I've not noticed anything

charming about you yet.'

Fleur laughed. \'Non? You must be the only boy in the country to think so, then.' Her forehead creased. 'I would like to see if my allure has more of an effect on you at some point, though. It is interesting for me. I have never really had anyone to properly test it on.'

\'If you like. Just don't make me do anything particularly embarrassing when I do succumb.'

A bright gleam entered her blue eyes. 'No promises, Harry. Do not forget, we are still rivals.'

*I won't forget.* Harry's thoughts came in a soft, smooth whisper. *And if you turn out like all the others, I won't forgive you, either. Not when you told me you were different.*

# Fairytale in the Room of Requirement

Music drifted up to the foot of the wide, stone staircase. Countless pupils drifted past, and the portraits nodded and swayed to its tempo.

Professor McGonagall tapped her fingers against her hip.

*This is about as good a choice of location to wait as Professor McGonagall's choice of that tartan horror for a dress.* Harry leant against the balustrade, stared at the ceiling, and held his breath as the time dragged by. *Maybe Fleur was just setting me up to throw me off for the tournament.* He smothered the twist of anxiety in his gut and studied his fingernails. *No. Don't think about stuff like that. She said she's different. She's not given you a reason to distrust her. Don't ruin something for no reason.*

Professor McGonagall cast a swift tempus charm. \'You *do* have a

partner, don\'t you, Mr Potter?'

*I hope I do.* He stamped the knot of worry back down. *She promised.*

\'I\'m sure she's just fashionably late, professor,\' he said. \'Well, you can transfigure your robes into something more

suitable while you wait. As long as she arrives before Miss Delacour and

her date, it will not matter.\'

*Are you going to transfigure your tartan terror into something suitable, too, professor?* Harry bit his tongue before the question slipped out.

Cedric sniggered. \'I don\'t think Fleur Delacour\'s arrival will come

*before* Harry\'s date.\'

Cho giggled into Cedric's shoulder. Viktor Krum snorted. 'Da.'

Hermione hung on his arm, her fingers curled round Krum's bicep.

She worried at her lip so hard the sleek coil of hair atop her head wobbled.

Harry waved his wand over his school robes, transfiguring them in one smooth motion from plain black to a dark shade of green with silver edging. *I finally look like the Heir of Slytherin.*

Professor McGonagall\'s expression tightened, but her eyes remained soft.

*Should've listened to the raggedy hat.* Harry stifled a sigh.

*Wouldn't have got all wound up trying to be the perfect hero if I'd not been in Gryffindor. Might've murdered Malfoy, though. Of course, most decent people would probably consider that another argument for joining Slytherin.*

Movement flashed in the corner of Harry's eye. Fleur descended the stairs in a gown of shimmering silver. The individual threads shone like they were coated in molten metal and the material shivered around her hips like heat haze. Relief flooded Harry when her eyes flicked to him and softened.

*She looks beautiful.* A small smile crept onto his lips. *Her allure...* Harry tore his eyes away and held his breath. *Too beautiful. As if everyone didn't have enough reason to envy and hate me, I've got the girl they're all dreaming about, too. Fantastic.*

\'Miss Delacour.\' Professor McGonagall pursed her lips. \'You are late and without a date.\'

Fleur gave the transfiguration professor the sort of look that had reminded Harry of the Hungarian Horntail. \'My date is already waiting for

me.' She swayed into the middle of the group and slipped her arm through

Harry\'s.

Her heat burnt against his skin like the summer sun on his back. *Deep breaths, Harry. It's only for a few hours.* He forced himself to stand tall and pulled a smile onto his face.

A flicker of warmth passed through Fleur's eyes, then she turned

a broad smirk on Professor McGonagall. \'International cooperation.'

\'Well, it's too late to change now. It's time for the opening dance.' Professor McGonagall spared a long look for Harry and Fleur and bustled off.

Harry's heart began to pound. A host of staring eyes prickled on

his skin as they approached the Great Hall.

\'I do not enjoy dancing,\' Fleur whispered. \'Not with people I do not know or trust, so I hope you do not mind if we only dance together. For as short a time as possible if it still makes you uncomfortable.\'

Harry took a deep breath and nodded. He pictured the circle of black ink on its white page and tried to drown the whispers in its dark, but the searing heat of Fleur's skin against his burnt through the circle and all those bright, gimlet eyes glimmered from its depths.

A cheerful waltz burst across the hall and his feet followed Fleur's light pull. The ink on the page faded into the flash of bright, sky-blue eyes a few inches from his own and the pale rose curve of a small, soft smile. He let himself drown in her until the prickle of eyes eased and the music faded.

'Not so bad, Harry?' Fleur stepped back and the noise of the rest of the Great Hall crashed back over him like a wave. 'I think there are a lot of envious wizards out there.'

'And some envious witches,' Harry said. 'Sadly, I think they're all

envious of *me*.'

Fleur swept her silver hair over her shoulder. 'You did not answer my question.'

'It wasn't so bad.' He followed her to a side table covered in drinks, a little relief swooping through him. 'I won't pretend I want to do it again, though.'

Fleur laughed and perused the bottles. 'I will not force you. I would rather we danced upstairs alone than before the gossiping peanut gallery.'

Harry picked up a bottle of red wine and frowned. *They\'re serving alcohol at a ball underage wizards and witches can attend?*

\'The ball was only supposed to be for students who were seventeen and over.\' Fleur tapped a finger on the top of his bottle. \'When your name came out, they decided to let younger years attend so you would not be all alone.\'

\'I guess nobody remembered to remove all this from the drinks

list.\'

\'Wine?\' Fleur tugged the bottle from Harry's grip and put it down

on the table well out of reach. 'Good wine, *not* that bottle of paint-stripper

you were holding.'

Harry read the label of the proffered bottle of elven wine. 'I'll

trust your taste, then. You *are* French.'

'I know wine. French or not.' Fleur tapped two crystal glasses with her wand. They floated after her as she led him to a table at the side of the room. 'I am a little impressed, actually. My allure did not seem to affect you much and I threw a fair amount your way.\'

\'You shouldn't have done, the others--\'

\'They would have stared regardless.' Fleur tilted her chin up. 'I do not need magic to catch boys' eyes. I never have, not since I was a little girl.\' She proffered him the bottle and a glass.

Harry poured himself a glass of white wine. *If it's anything like the firewhiskey, this might help.* A horrible sinking sensation seized him and he glanced into the crowd. *I hope Katie's not drinking.*

\'Searching for someone?\' Fleur followed his line of sight. 'That Katie girl?'

\'Avoiding.'

\'Ah.\' Fleur's blue eyes bored into his. 'Well, she is not worth

wasting thought on, especially not when *I* am here.'

Harry chuckled. 'So modest.'

'C'est vrais.' She shrugged. \'Hogwarts is very different to Beauxbatons.\' Fleur sipped her wine. 'The suits of armour, despite the yule garlands, do not quite match the occasion.'

\'I imagine it is.'

\'We have ice statues at Christmas in France instead of this.\' Fleur smiled and took another sip of wine. \'I learnt the enchantments in my first year so I could make one for Gabby.\'

Harry recalled the photo of the two smiling girls in Fleur's room.

\'You miss your sister.\'

\'She is coming with my mother to see the second task.\' Fleur

finished her glass and reached for the bottle. 'That is not so far away.'

Harry drank some of his own as she glanced away. Half the glass went down like it was water.

Peeves burst into the room, cackling and showering nearby couples with white berries.

*Mistletoe, probably... hopefully.*

Dean and Ron scowled at the mischievous spirit as he pelted them with berries.

Harry grinned. *They look like they've been ditched.*

\'Beauxbatons does not have a poltergeist, either.\' Fleur offered the bottle to Harry, a bright spark glimmering in her eyes. 'A shame, really. He seems most amusing.'

Harry topped his glass up with the burgundy liquid.

\'I believe there's a debate every year over whether he should be expelled from the halls or not,\' Harry said. \'He doesn\'t cause too much chaos, just enough to be a nuisance every now and again. The caretaker, Argus Filch, hates him.\'

\'From what I have heard, your caretaker hates everything except

his pet.\'

\'There's probably some truth in that.' Harry eyed the pristine

Christmas cake. 'Do you think we're allowed to cut it? I've never tried Christmas cake before.'

\'Do you want some?\' Fleur conjured a knife and cut a thin slice.

'Nobody will tell us no.'

\'Thank you.\' Harry accepted the slice.

Fleur cut herself one three times the size and picked the marzipan off, eating large forkfuls with a small smile. She caught Harry's raised eyebrow and laughed. \'I have a sweet tooth.'

\'Is that your weakness?\' Harry quipped.

A soft chuckle slipped from Fleur's red lips. \'Non. It would take more than the offer of something sweet to persuade me to help you win, though I *am* very fond of marzipan.\'

'Is it a veela thing?' Harry watched Fleur\'s slice of cake vanish in a

series of swift, neat forkfuls.

Sugar glazed her red lips, the little white crystals melting on her

skin.

\'Most wizards know very little about veela.\' Fleur licked the sugar

from her lips with the tip of her tongue. \'Witches know even less.\' She poured the rest of the bottle into her glass.

\'The only thing I know about veela is the effect of your allure. I felt it at the World Cup.\'

\'So you *do* feel it,\' Fleur murmured. \'I wonder, then, why you are so resistant to mine. Mine is stronger than most.\'

\'I heard that you're part-veela, perhaps your aura is different?\' Harry suggested.

\'You were correct that the only thing you know about veela is the feel of our magic. You really should have gone to the library once you knew I was veela.\'

\'I\'ve had a lot on my mind.'

\'Well, so that you do not embarrass yourself, or *me*, in the future, I will tell you something about veela.\' She flipped her silver hair back over one shoulder and shifted her chair around to face him.

\'You\'d throw away your advantage?\' Harry grinned. 'That doesn't seem like you. What about winning?'

Fleur laughed. \'Do not be naive, Harry. It would take less than an hour for you to find out what I intend to tell you and this way I can control what you know.\'

\'I don't think you'd tell me that if you had any intention of actually

using the opportunity.'

Fleur\'s eyes flicked toward the bottle. \'Perhaps not. Truthfully, I dislike the idea of you having misconceptions about me and if I do not tell you myself, you will only hear more silly rumours from someone else.' She toyed with the last piece of marzipan. 'The first thing you need to know is that there is no such thing as a *part veela*. A female child of a veela is a veela. It is a common misconception that we're part-human creatures, one encouraged by wizards who would like to use certain laws against us, when in fact we are simply witches with an extra set of inherited abilities.\'

\'Like parseltongue.'

\'A little more wide-ranging and less reviled, but yes.\'

*Interesting.*

\'So where do veela really come from, then?\' he asked.

\'Eastern Europe has legends that fit our description going back millennia. They can be traced East and down through the Caucus Mountains to the earliest such stories in Mesopotamia. There were myths of harpies, magical creatures, and fire worship all across the region. The rituals and miracles in ancient scripture there are often familiar to us.

\'You can conjure fire.' Harry sighed. 'I bet that's useful.'

\'I am also resistant to the heat,\' Fleur said. \'Do you want any?\' She leant across the table to procure a bottle of sweet, dessert wine. 'It has never been my forte, but I can be persuaded to share from time to time.'

\'No, but thank you.\' Harry offered her a half-smile. 'I don't think I have your tolerance and I'd rather not get myself, or you, laughed at.'

\'It is very nice, but I do very much dislike being laughed at, so I will save it for myself.' Fleur began to pour herself a glass, but, midway to tipping the bottle, glanced up and caught sight of a group of wizards making eyes at her and muttering. \'I hope you will not be insulted if I leave as early as possible. I fear the *invitations* are about to start.\'

\'Relieved.'

The corner of Fleur's lips twitched. \'We can return to the Room of

Requirement, if you like?\'

Harry raised an eyebrow. 'Really?'

\'I cannot go back to the carriage early, it would be humiliating, and I have no other company I might prefer.\' A mischievous gleam shone in Fleur's blue eyes. 'Most boys would trade a great deal to be alone with me in a room after a few bottles of wine, Harry.'

*Katie won\'t be able to find me there, and nor will Ron, or Dean, or Ginny.* Harry found the idea brought a faint, warm rush of relief.

'Well? Are you going to say yes?' Fleur sipped her wine. 'Or has

the thought of the two of us alone late at night left you speechless?'

'I'm game.' Harry picked the crust off a mince pie. 'I don't really have any other plans.'

Fleur watched him pull the pastry apart and finished the last gulp of her wine. 'Ok. I will meet you at the stairs in a couple of minutes.' She tapped the neck of the wine bottle. 'I need to make a detour to the bathroom first.'

*How much has she drunk?* Harry ran his eyes over the three bottles. *How can she even stand? Aunt Petunia's about her size, though she's wider and shorter, and she'd be comatose after half that much.*

Fleur strode through the hall, glimmering like the Mirror of Erised.

Conversations parted for her like clouds before the summer sun.

*No point lingering alone where everyone can see me.* Harry pushed himself to his feet and headed for the stairs.

\'You\'re leaving.\' Katie's voice caught him at the exit to the hall.

*So close.* Harry twisted round on his heel.

Katie's tight, burgundy-red dress matched the wine in her glass; its neckline plunged far enough to bring heat to Harry's face. He dragged his gaze up and found a deep well of emotion shining in Katie's brown eyes.

*now.*

Harry's gut coiled into a tight knot. *I really don't want to do this*

'Not really my scene, this,\' he said.

Katie edged a step closer to him, tugging at the little finger of her

left hand. \'If you\'re bored, or in want of a partner, you can always come dance with me.\'

Fleur appeared at the base of the stairs. Her blue eyes roved across the hall to land on Harry and narrowed.

*Fantastic.* Harry sighed. *I should go.*

\'Has Roger Davies abandoned you?\' he asked.

\'Yes.' Katie pointed to where he was dancing with a member of his own year and house. 'I deserved it, though.' She extended the same hand in his direction. \'Would you like to? Not even as a date, just as friends.\'

For a moment the warmth and hopeful glint in her eyes tugged at

the strings of Harry's heart.

*No. She did it once. She'll do it again.* Harry smothered the tangle of feeling. *If I forget, I'll just repeat my mistake.*

He eyed Fleur\'s tightening grip on the banister. \'I'm afraid I can\'t.\' Katie followed Harry\'s gaze. \'Oh. You're still with her. I guess

I'd've had to worry after all, huh. It\'s okay. I understand.\' She gave him a

weak smile. \'I\'ll find Alicia and Angelina. Have a good night, Harry.\'

*Bye Katie.* He watched her disappear into the crowd, and turned and strode toward the stairs, a bitter pang tearing through his chest. He crushed it down. *You were no better than the rest of them in the end.*

\'What did *she* want?\' Fleur demanded. \'To dance,\' Harry replied.

\'You said no?\'

\'I had a prior commitment,\' Harry said. \'I couldn\'t abandon her to dance with another girl. It seemed a bit rude.\'

\'How noble of you.\' Fleur smiled and her eyes turned soft as the summer sky.

\'I think it would have been a bad idea.'

*I think you would've probably used your allure to ruin it. I doubt you'd've liked losing out to Katie.*

\'I think you were right.' The slightest edge lingered in Fleur's tone,

a faint sharpness that made all the hair stand up on the back of his neck.

Harry winced as he followed her up the stairs. *Definitely a good thing I said no.*

Fleur paused before the empty wall. 'I will choose, I think. You have three more years to play with this enchanted room.'

Harry stepped into a winter palace. Ice statues sparkled like so much diamond in each corner, reflecting a thousand scattered lights of the candles hovering above them.

\'I like the candles in the Great Hall.\' Fleur gestured at her hovering candles. \'Beauxbatons has crystal chandeliers, but I think this is more scenic.\'

She took the furthest seat from the door and a bottle of elven wine and an elegant crystal glass appeared on the arm of the chair.

*Who left those in here?* Harry took the other seat across from her.

*Probably some seventh year's date that went wrong.*

\'Do you like it?\' Fleur pointed a finger at the room. \'I tried to make it something that was of both our schools.\'

\'I do.'

She poured herself a glass of wine and took a long sip. \'Alone with a veela in a room that can provide almost anything you want. This, I imagine, is the beginning of many adolescent wizards\' dreams.\'

\'Not mine.\' Harry grinned. \'You told me too much about veela. I

don't want to get set on fire.\'

\'I *would* have an advantage here. It is warm and dry, my fire would come to me faster than normal here.\'

*Presumably, if warm and dry has a positive effect, then wet and cold would create the reverse.* Harry filed that away for a later date.

\'My wand's easier to reach.\' He let it slip from his sleeve into his palm. 'Advantage me.'

A ball of blue flames burst into sparks at his feet before he had managed to catch it. \'I do not need my wand to set you on fire, remember.\'

\'Can you transform?\' Harry asked.

\'I can, but I will not, not for your curiosity.\'

\'I suppose that\'s fair.'

Fleur finished her glass of wine. \'Where would you be if I had not

asked you to be my shield?'

\'Probably here, just alone.\' Harry managed a wry smile. \'Or I might be downstairs, kissing Katie.\'

\'I have never kissed anyone.\' A hint of pink blossomed on Fleur's

cheeks. 'Despite what the other girls like to say about me.'

\'Neither have I, but I sort of suspect that if I'd agreed to dance with Katie, I would've ended up kissing her.\' He smothered the tug on his heart. 'It would've been hard to say no if I was alone.'

\'A good thing I made you come with me.\'

\'Possibly. I can\'t imagine kissing Katie would end well.\'

'If she turned on you so quickly before, she would again.' Fleur shrugged her shoulders. 'I have made that mistake, more than once. Best

not to repeat it, Harry, I promise you. It will hurt more each time until suddenly it does not. And that feeling is worse than when it hurt.'

*I know.* Harry grimaced as the memory of the emptiness clawed at him with sharp, cold talons.

Fleur sighed and leant forward. \'I asked you yesterday if you

would let me test to see how resistant you are to my allure...\'

\'I stand by what I said.\' Curiosity stirred in Harry. 'I didn't feel too much before. Maybe a little bit earlier, I think.'

\'Focus on me,\' Fleur commanded. Harry nodded.

Fleur's summer sky blue eyes shone bright beneath a veil of lustrous, silver-blond hair. Her pale, rose-pink lips curved into a soft, warm smile.

Something lurched inside Harry's chest and the breath caught in his throat. *She's so beautiful.* He tried to drag his eyes away from her lips and failed. The warmth of her skin burnt like a flame, only a hand's length away. *Well, I'm clearly not as resistant as either of us thought.*

\'What do you feel?\' she asked.

\'I've no idea how I didn\'t notice you from the very beginning.\' The words slipped off his tongue as smooth as the bright silver of her dress. \'You\'re the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.\'

Fleur stared, a small, bemused smile hovering at the corner of her

lips.

Green strands of leaves twisted their way down from around the

candles. The sweet smell of hot leaves mixed into the scent of burnt holly

and marzipan clinging to Fleur. Their emerald-hued, droplet shapes surrounded a scatter of white berries.

*Mistletoe.* Harry's heart dashed itself against his ribs and his

mouth turned dry as a desert. *Fleur's in control of the room.*

His eyes flicked down from the candles and mistletoe.

Fleur's eyes shone a finger's length away. She murmured something in French beneath her breath and pressed her lips against his, her lashes fluttering against his cheek. Harry breathed in the taste of sharp wine and sweet sugar as she traced the line of his lower lip with the tip of her tongue.

Fleur pulled back and stood, her lips curving into a small, soft

smile. 'À bientôt, Harry,' she murmured, slipping out.

The door swung shut with a faint thud.

Harry stared up as the candles faded and the mistletoe curled back up into the shadows of the ceiling. His heart hammered as loud as thunder and a small smile crept onto his lips.

The ice statues melted away into the floor.

'Bye, Fleur,' he whispered.

# The Hangover

Light spilt in through her window, bright and offensive. Fleur scrunched her eyes shut and found herself staring at a wall of bright red. Her heartbeat pounded against the back of her skull, the taste of last night's wine curdling on her sandpaper dry tongue.

*Too much wine.* Fleur groaned and buried her face in her pillow, but the thudding at the base of her skull continued. *Urgh. Stupide. You got carried away.*

She conjured a glass of water and took several small sips, directing a strong charm at her mouth and the pounding faded from her head. *And just like that all the problems of my morning are gone.*

Something niggled at her brain, tugging at her thoughts like she would pick at a loose thread. *Oh, merde. I kissed a fourteen year old.*

Fleur moaned and buried her face back into her pillow. 'And it was my first kiss.' She rolled onto her back and clutched the pillow to her breast, staring up at the plain ceiling. 'At least it was nice. Harry would've enjoyed it.'

*Harry...*

'Merde.' Fleur squeezed her eyes shut and kicked her feet against her bed. 'I didn't tell him it wasn't my allure. He's going to think I enthralled him. *Merde!'*

*It doesn't matter. He probably would've turned out like all the other boys anyway.* She took a deep breath. *Don't think about it.* Fleur studied the cracks in the white-painted ceiling. *You\'re the most beautiful girl I have ever seen.* Harry's murmur rose up from among her thoughts and a smile slipped onto her lips.

'This is so stupid. I sound like Emilie or Caroline.'

*What do I do? He must hate me, thinking I forced him to kiss me for a joke.* She clenched her fists and tried to smother the wrench of her heart. *People like us don't trust easily, now he must not trust me at all.*

\'Fleur?\' Madame Maxime hammered on the doorframe. 'Fleur?'

*And now it's time for my scolding. Merde. Merde. Merde.*

\'One moment.' Fleur sighed and kicked her crumpled dress into the bathroom, shoving her shoes back into the small cupboard beside the door and flicking her wand at the door's lock. 'Come in, Madame.'

Madame Maxime swept into the room and took a seat in the corner. \'I did not see you return from the castle after the Yule Ball.\'

Fleur perched on the edge of her bed and pulled her duvet around the shoulder of her pyjamas. \'The Disillusionment Charm. I left early.\'

\'You did not return here early, neither Emilie nor Caroline saw

you.\'

*I see Emilie and Caroline didn't even wait until this morning to*

*start spreading gossip. If they\'d actually managed to get dates, they wouldn\'t have had time to make things worse for me*.

\'I spent some time with a friend,\' Fleur said.

Madame Maxime\'s shoulders stiffened like she'd been petrified. \'Your friend was also your choice of company and fellow champion Harry Potter, I assume.\'

\'You assume correctly.\'

\'He's fourteen, Fleur. I can understand your desire to have a platonic date, one that is not affected by your natural magic, but sneaking

off with him for the evening... I cannot and will not condone such

behaviour. He is a *child*.\'

A faint heat oozed through Fleur's bones and feathers prickled beneath her skin. \'I think you should've put *far* less trust in what you've heard about my evening than it seems you have, madame.\'

Madame Maxime's eyes flicked to faint white tufts sliding through the skin of Fleur's forearms and back up to her eyes. \'Oh? So you weren't seen by your fellow students disappearing off to the abandoned upper floors of the castle?\'

\'I\'m sure we were,\' Fleur snapped. \'I wanted to spend the evening away from gossiping, shallow individuals who had nothing better to do than cast aspersions at their betters. Harry was kind enough not to leave me on my own. My only regret of the evening is failing to avoid them half as well as I'd hoped.\'

*And kissing Harry.* Fleur's heart plummeted down somewhere into the pit of her stomach. *Or kissing him and leaving before he understood why I did.*

Madame Maxime's jaw dropped and the tips of her ears turned

red. \'You mean to say you spent the whole night talking?\'

\'Until I left at a little before midnight.\' Fleur buried every image of mistletoe and candles beneath several years of patience.

*What is the point of asking me these ridiculous questions if she is not going to believe my answers?*

Her headmistress steepled her fingers. \'I believe you. However, you showed poor judgement in directing your allure at him so blatantly, then again in attending the Yule Ball with him. You've compounded it by vanishing with him for the evening. Rumours are already flying.\'

\'Let them.\' Fleur let her disdain pour off her tongue. \'I've never cared before. I won't start now.\'

*I hope Harry doesn\'t believe them.*

\'It might be best for the two of you to let things calm down before spending too much more time in each other\'s company.' Her dark eyes softened. 'I approve of your friendship, Fleur, Harry Potter stands a better chance than most at understanding the trials you suffer because of your heritage, but neither of you have made things easy for yourselves.\'

*She might be right. I need to sort out my head before I make things even worse.*

\'You should probably read this.\' Madame Maxime deposited a copy of the Daily Prophet in Fleur\'s hand. 'Throw it away once you're done. I don't want to read anything else in it.'

*Part-veela rival charms Boy-Who-Lived.* Fleur snorted. *There's no*

*such thing as a part veela.*

\'I don\'t think I need to bother reading it,' she said.

*Rita Skeeter's sordid work, no doubt.* Fleur tossed it into the bin.

*Anyone who believes that trash isn't worth listening to.*

\'I've already written a letter to your father in France to reassure him there is no truth behind this. I'm glad to discover this was also the truth.\'

Fleur favoured Madame Maxime with a smile. \'Thank you.\'

\'I suggest you focus on preparing for the second task. It will help take your mind off this and allow time for the air to clear for both you and Mr Potter. He has his own solution to worry about, too.\' Madame Maxime

tapped her huge fingers on the top of her knee. \'Is there anything you would like assistance with?\'

\'How much are you allowed to give?\' Fleur asked.

Madame Maxime coughed and glanced away. \'As long as I'm not

*directly* helping you with the task it's not cheating.'

Fleur weighed up her options. *Better to win*. *If they're smart, they'll all take advantage, too.*

\'I need to adapt the bubble-head charm for long and repeated underwater use,\' she said.

\'Not the best choice for a long underwater venture in which you might encounter dangerous creatures.\' Madame Maxime frowned. \'The more power put into the charm, the more air compressed into the bubble, and the more dangerous the reaction when the bubble bursts.\'

\'Is there an alternative?\'

\'Transfiguration, or enchanting an item of clothing to convert water to breathable oxygen would be your best solutions. The latter especially, given your skill at enchanting and charming. There're plenty of pieces of spell-weaving capable of creating such an effect, but I suggest simplicity. You don't need it to last the rest of your life.\'

*I'll probably be very busy if I've got to create something almost from scratch. That's good. I need some space before I talk to Harry again and being busy will keep my mind off things.*

\'I shall leave you to it.\' Madame Maxime withdrew.

Fleur plucked a thin piece of gauze out of her wardrobe. 'You'll do.

I never wear you, anyway.'

A light tapping echoed from the window. Fleur flicked her wand at the curtains and the window. A snowy owl perched on the thin ledge.

*First, though, I'll reply to Gabby.* Fleur tugged a wad of parchment out of the envelope. *This looks like an essay. Gabby must be lonely.*

Fleur\'s welter of feelings swirled and she picked up her wand. 'Well, if you want a long reply, you're about to get more than you bargained for, Gabby.'

She tapped her wand's tip against the silver-nibbed quill lying on her desk. A small ring of runes round the quill's shaft glowed a faint white and it swooped off the desk to hover over the stack of blank parchment, beginning to write.

Fleur twirled her rose-wood wand over herself and slipped out of her room.

Emelie and Caroline sat in the communal part of the carriage, sniggering over a copy of the Daily Prophet.

She squashed the heat that flared through her body and the feathers that slipped from under skin. 'Credidero,\' she whispered, looping her wand in a circle at each of the girls.

*Cassandra\'s Curse*. *Now nobody will believe a word either of you*

*say.*

A small smile crept onto her lips and Fleur swept out of the

carriage, heading for the distant library tower.

*At least Harry's never in there.* Fleur's stomach knotted and her heart flopped about inside her chest. *He won't see me.* Her Disillusionment Charm wavered and frayed. *Even if I half want him to.*

Viktor Krum slumped over a stack of transfiguration books and what looked like a detailed anatomical study of some kind of fish.

*So he's aware of the second task, too.*

He glanced up as she passed, blinking away a faint glazed look and covering his notes. Fleur dipped her head in greeting.

\'Someone took out the best book about aquatic magical creatures.\' Hermione Granger's distinctive voice drifted from among the shelves. 'Madam Pince told me it was Beauxbatons\' champion that took it out. She shouldn\'t be allowed to take books out of *our* library, isn\'t one school's knowledge enough for her?\'

\'We do not have access to our own libraries, Hermione.\' A grin hovered at the corners of Viktor Krum's mouth. \'It is a good sign, da. Fleur Delacour is winning. If she has the book we want, it means we're on the right track.\'

*Yes it does*.

\'It\'s still a bad idea.\' Hermione sniffed. \'She\'s already bewitched Harry and he was joint second with you. You\'re probably her next target, Viktor.\'

\'You think because she is veela, she will manage to charm me into letting her win?\' Amusement danced in Viktor Krum's eyes. \'I am from Bulgaria, we have a proud tradition of veela witches there. They rarely stoop to such a thing. Besides, I am very competitive, I do not *let* anyone beat me.\'

\'And Harry? She used her allure on him, everyone knows that.\'

*Not like that, I didn't.* Fleur ground her teeth. *And it didn't affect*

*him at all, anyway.*

\'He didn't seem enthralled by her at the Yule Ball,\' Viktor said. \'You can tell when someone is under the charm of a veela, it shows in their eyes, like any compulsion. I've never seen it in his. Harry Potter seems even more resistant than I am, so even if she tried, she must've failed. It hardly matters given the location of the next task. A veela's at a disadvantage in such conditions.\'

\'Only if you manage to transfigure yourself,\' Hermione said. \'Exactly why I should be concentrating on learning the details of

this diagram and not getting distracted talking with pretty girls.\'

Hermione huffed and turned pink.

Viktor Krum laughed. \'It\'s only a partial transfiguration, I'll be fine, but we should keep our voices down. Fleur Delacour is in the library and might come back this way.\'

Hermione perked up. \'Maybe she brought the book back.'

A low chuckle drifted through the bookshelves from Viktor Krum's seat. \'It won't be returned until after the task.\'

*Of course it won\'t be*. Fleur skimmed the titles of a surprising number of books on enchanted items that turned water breathable. *A study of the Greek wizarding city of Atlantis. The one that collapsed into the sea when the volcano on Santorini erupted over a millennia ago*. *They produce a lot of aquatic water plants for potions' ingredients, so they ought to know something about it.*

She plucked the book off the shelf and flicked through the pages. 'The Divers' Charm... it takes oxygen from the water and keeps a thin, constant layer of it on the reverse-side of some cloth.' Fleur read through the detail beneath. 'That'll do.'

*Back to the carriage.*

Fleur hurried from the library and slipped along the corridors. Heads began to turn as she passed the Great Hall.

*Merde.* She reached for her wand. *My Disillusionment Charm's*

*still gone.*

Fleur fixed a polite smile on her lips and strode through the hall. A head of unruly, black hair waited at the far end of the Gryffindor table.

*What will I tell him if he sees me?* Her smile fell from her face. *He'll be angry. He thinks I tricked him into kissing me. And there are so many people here.* Her stomach churned and whirled. *I don\'t know what to say.*.*.*

Fleur took a deep breath and turned and walked back the way

she'd come.

*It's for the best. If I talk to him before I've straightened things out with myself, I'll only make a mess of it.*

# Qui immolate diis Sacrificium

A field of ice statues stretched as far as he could see, glittering and glimmering in the light of countless candles. Mistletoe curled round them like ivy over the abandoned stones of ruined walls.

Fleur danced between them, swirling in her shimmering dress, wearing a soft, warm smile that tugged at the strings of Harry's heart like it were a puppet dangling beneath her fingers.

*Come closer.* The words refused to leave his lips.

He watched her sway as the ice statues began to melt. Fleur danced upon the shining surface of the water, floating over the waves like she weighed no more than a feather. Her shimmering silhouette drifted into the distance and the water rose to lap about his ankles, dark and cold as the Black Lake.

Harry opened his eyes to find his feet hanging over the end of the bed in the room of requirement. Blue and silver sheets and pillows shifted to dull white and the faint scent of burnt holly faded.

*Fleur's colours.*

He sighed. 'This room really has no respect for peoples' privacy.'

Harry's stomach growled as he swung himself out of bed and dragged his robes on. *Breakfast time.* He cast a quick tempus as he grabbed his glasses. *Or lunch time, apparently.*

Harry stumbled down the stairs to the Great Hall and plonked himself down on the end of the bench. A few first years shuffled down the table away from him as he helped himself to a sizable quantity of mashed potato and gravy.

Harry gulped down the first handful of forkfuls. *That's much better.* Memories seeped through his thoughts like ink through parchment, Fleur's sugar-glazed lips hovering at their heart. *Why did she kiss me? It was just supposed to be a test of her allure. She can't've thought I would hate it, not after spending a whole evening getting used to her being close to me.*

He spun his wand around on the table's surface.

*Is there something special about veela kisses?* Harry sighed. *If I'd tried to kiss her, that'd make sense, I was enthralled. It makes no sense for her to kiss me.*

People began to flow into the hall. Small groups gathered along the table from the door to the teacher's dais. Harry watched everyone stream into the hall in the reflection of the great, stained-glass window.

A cheerful looking Seamus and Neville came in towing a miserable Ron and Dean, and Ginny lingered to chat with a dirty blond haired Ravenclaw he half-recognised. Katie sat in the middle of the three Gryffindor chasers, chasing her food round her plate with her fork as Alicia and Angelina chattered past her.

*She looks like she didn't have a great evening.* A small flare of satisfaction rose through the stab of pity Harry felt. *She shouldn't've said yes to Roger Davies.*

A flash of familiar silver in the window caught his eye. 'Fleur...' Harry's heart spasmed and he clapped his mouth shut before anything else slipped out.

Fleur drifted halfway down the hall between the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw tables, her step uncertain and her usual smile fixed upon her face. A strong urge to wipe that cool, polite curve of her lips away and see the bright warmth of her real smile seized him.

Her eyes flicked to the end of the table where he was sitting and a soft hopeful glow rose within him.

She froze mid-stride, the smile slipping off her lips, and turned

and left.

Harry\'s heart sank into the cold, tight grip of the emptiness. *She's*

*avoiding me.* He spun his wand once more upon the table surface and slipped it back into his sleeve, counting down the seconds. *She's gone by now. Unless she's waiting for me out here?* Harry rose from his seat and strode out of the hall, wrestling with one last faint ray of hope.

No tell-tale shimmer lingered by the staircase or in the corridor.

The hope guttered and died like a candle beneath midnight rain.

*That's what you get for wishing.* Harry took the steps two at a time and hurried to the Chamber of Secrets. *Don't forget. They don't come true.*

\'Harry!\' The cheer on Myrtle\'s face vanished as she caught sight of his face. \'What\'s wrong, Harry?\'

He stared down into the puddle on the floor as he wrestled with all the words threatening to burst past his lips. \'You flooded the bathroom again, Myrtle.\'

The ghost giggled. \'If you slip and break your neck, you can stay

here with me.'

\'Thanks, Myrtle.\' Harry opened the chamber and wandered down the stairs.

*I'll probably be haunting somewhere around here in a couple of years once Dumbledore runs out of patience.*

\'Don\'t even think about opening that egg,\' Salazar snapped as he entered the study.

\'I have to open it to figure out the clue,\' Harry said. \'Maybe the clue is on the outside?\'

Harry gave him a flat look. *I'd sit here and let the egg scream at me all day, but even that won't blot out whatever this mess with Fleur is.*

\'It sounds worse than Godric\'s singing,\' Salazar grumbled. \'The only things less bearable than his singing were the months he spent learning Mermish and speaking it constantly above water and Rowena\'s poetry. She just couldn\'t grasp that a poem needed more than just a rhythm and some rhyming.\'

Harry tuned Salazar out. *If the basilisk was able to hear Salazar talking to himself, then Tom's probably only partially responsible for its madness.*

'Right, you.' He poked at the egg. 'Time to reveal all your secrets.'

It swivelled on its axis and toppled onto its side. \'Mermish,\' Salazar exploded.

*I think he may actually be growing senile.* Harry raised his eyebrows at the painting. *I didn't know that could happen to paintings. Maybe the magic wears off over time.*

\'Don\'t open it until it\'s underwater,\' Salazar said.

Harry sighed and folded his arms. \'I can\'t hear it if it\'s underwater.'

\'You\'ll be underwater, too,\' Salazar hissed in parseltongue. \'Stop acting sceptical and listen to the wizard who was heralded as one of the greatest of all time.\'

\'Will it sound any different underwater?\' Harry asked.

\'It\'s *Mermish*. It sounds horrible above the ground, but below it's

supposed to be quite beautiful.\' \'How deep is the pool?\'

\'Only about five metres,\' Salazar replied. \'I didn\'t want my basilisk to drown if she fell in.' A wide smile spread over his face. 'It will be cold, though.\'

*It seems my anti-Salazar device has come back to bite me.*

The egg screeched all the way to the bridge, drowning out

Salazar's indignant protests.

Harry stripped off his clothes and dropped into the pool before the vast likeness of Salazar\'s face. Ice-cold water closed over him and choral singing drifted from the egg in his hands.

*'Come seek us where our voices sound. We cannot sing above the ground. And while you\'re searching ponder this; we\'ve taken what you\'ll sorely miss. An hour long you\'ll have to look, and to recover what we took, but past an hour, the prospect\'s black; too late, it\'s gone; it won\'t come back.'*

He dragged himself out of the water, shivering like a leaf in the cold of the Chamber of Secrets and fumbling his wand out from under his robes. Harry muttered the incantation for half a dozen warming charms through chattering teeth and pulled his robes back on.

\'Was it warm?\' Salazar snickered at Harry's blue fingernails and pale skin as he stumbled back into the study. 'It looks like it was warm.'

\'I will leave the egg open when I depart...'

\'What did it say?\'

\'Something of mine will or has been taken; something *important*.\'

\'Oh?\' Salazar raised an eyebrow at him. \'I thought everything you possessed was down here cluttering up my study?\'

\'So did I... Maybe it\'s just a turn of phrase.'

\'Maybe they intend to take something you can\'t hide or protect even with warning and time to prepare. A person, perhaps?\'

*Who would I even miss? They can\'t choose another champion,*

*that wouldn't work.*

\'The only person they could take is my godfather,\' Harry said. \'If they find him, then being party to the tournament is the *least* of his worries, or mine, probably.\'

\'What else did you learn?\'

\'Whatever they intend for me to retrieve will be kept by the Merpeople, underwater, for at least an hour.\'

\'There are merpeople in the Black Lake,\' Salazar said. \'Godric used

to talk to them. Intelligent enough, but not overly friendly.'\'

\'There\'s a giant squid and who knows what else in there, as well.\' Harry groaned. 'I bet it's as cold as that damn pool, too.'

\'Where did the squid come from?\' Salazar asked. \'How would I know?\'

\'You might've been curious.'

\'I wasn\'t, but I *do* know it eats toast. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan feed it.\'

\'Squid do *not* eat toast. Still, I advise avoiding it for the duration of the task. Unless you're the sort of guy who enjoys cuddling creatures with a lot of tentacles?' Salazar stroked his goatee with the fingers of his left hand. 'How do you intend to breathe? There\'s the bubble head charm, but it isn\'t really meant for long-term use. Self-transfiguration, enchanting, and even a selection of magical plants are better bets.\'

\'Transfiguration's my forté,\' Harry said. \'I don\'t want to have to choke down anything from Snape\'s stores. He\'s probably pre-emptively poisoned half of it.\'

\'You\'ll have to pick something to transfigure yourself into. You\'ve chosen the hardest route. You won\'t be able to master a full self- transfiguration in time, but a partial one could be managed.\'

\'Obviously it needs to be something that breathes underwater.'

\'Don\'t get too complex.\' Salazar drummed his fingers on his chin, batting away his serpent's tail when it curled around his forehead. \'You only need to breathe for an hour, gills would be enough.\' The snake's tail coiled round Salazar's neck and he dragged the serpent off and dropped it on the floor. 'Irritating reptile.'

'I guess I'll just stick with gills, then.' Harry glanced at the shelf of books on aquatic creatures. 'Kind of a shame, really.'

\'You\'re going to have to redesign half of your respiratory system,\' Salazar said. \'If you replace the alveoli and bronchi within your lungs with the filaments of gills you'll simply have to inhale water to breathe. As long as you keep oxygenated water flowing over the filaments you'll be fine.\'

\'That sounds deceptively simple.' Harry frowned. 'And everything you've made sound simple turns out to be horribly complex, like blood magic, or parseltongue.'

\'Well, you\'ll have to breathe very quickly to keep the water flowing in and out fast enough, and it'll feel extremely unnatural to inhale water in such a manner.\'

\'I knew there would be a catch.'

\'If you\'re careful you\'ll be fine. I\'ll teach you the spells used to reverse faulty transfigurations before you start practising, just in case.\' Salazar tapped his wand against his palm. 'Don't even *think* of dying in some kind of transfiguration-related mishap. Godric will never let me hear the end of it if you do.'

\'You know, it\'s probably unfair that I have your assistance,\' Harry

said.

\'Unfair on who? Your rivals? Voldemort? Albus Dumbledore?\'

Salazar fixed him with the look Harry had dubbed the *your-acting-like- Godric* expression. 'You're here to *win*.'

\'I suppose that's true.'

\'You aren\'t going to defend Dumbledore?\'

\'The prat has been doing his best to get me killed every year, I won\'t be defending him again.\'

\'There\'s my heir,\' Slytherin crooned. 'Don\'t let him use you, you

aren\'t his sacrifice to make.\'

\'I\'m not anyone\'s sacrifice but my own.'

\'I suppose that's better than being everyone\'s enduring, noble hero.\' Salazar sighed. \'Any chance you\'d consider not dying to destroy that horcrux?\'

\'It has to be destroyed,\' Harry murmured. 'I can't stand here and pretend my life outweighs the hundreds and maybe even thousands of lives it would save.

Salazar studied him with a strange glint in his deep green eyes.

'You've not snapped at me. Are you okay, Harry?\'

\'The Yule Ball didn't go how I expected.\' The words bubbled up

off his tongue before he could close his mouth and catch them. \'The Katie girl again?\'

\'No, I went with Fleur, my rival.'

\'I assume there's some context to explain that?'

Harry dragged his thoughts into order. \'I didn't realise at first, but she's a bit like me. I remembered what you told me about finding equals and her company's not awful. She... *demanded* I take her to the Ball. I agreed. She told me she was different from all the others who turned on me.\'

Salazar's eyes softened. \'She left you for another during the

evening?\'

\'No. We spent the day before together, getting to know one another a bit beforehand. We talked about a few things, the egg, the second task, veela...\' He trailed off at Salazar\'s darkening expression. \'What?\'

\'Veela?\'

\'She is veela,\' Harry said.

\'That makes sense,\' Salazar muttered. \'Did she try to use her allure to get you to do something?\'

'I'm resistant.\'

\'Of course you are! My family have always been gifted with the mind arts, the longer you study occlumency the less effect you will feel from such magic. I'd wager you'd already be hard to snare for all but the strongest of them.'

\'She turned the full force of it upon me to test my resistance. Once I gave in, she kissed me and left.\'

Salazar\'s frown deepened. \'I don't understand. There seems to be

no dilemma except why she might've kissed you. I'd feared---'

\'She\'s avoiding me.\' Harry's stomach clenched at the memory of Fleur turning away from him in the hall and he balled his fists. \'I thought --- I *knew* it'd be too good to be true. I\'m fourteen. She's seventeen. She kissed me after testing how well I could resist her allure. She knows I don't like people close to me. And now she's avoiding me.\'

\'Ah,\' Salazar murmured.

Harry stared at the painting. \'Ah?\'

\'I was about to say that my fears seemed unfounded, but---' \'But they weren\'t?\'

\'You said she asked about the second task and the egg.\' Salazar gathered his snake up and let it coil round his wand arm. \'And she began avoiding you shortly after realising you were not entirely resistant to her allure.\'

Several little pieces began to fall into place in Harry\'s head like the small stones at the start of an avalanche. *She understood me, but she just wanted to find some way of beating me.* A fist of ice clenched around his heart. *She lied. She's just like all the rest.*

you.\'

\'I could be wrong,\' Salazar murmured. \'She didn't have to kiss

\'No.\' Bitter, high laughter slipped from his lips. \'She didn't *have* to

kiss me, but she wanted me to know she'd won, didn't she?\' The ice in his

chest seeped into his veins. \'She *used* me,\' he hissed.

\'She didn't need to ask you to the Yule Ball.' Salazar's brows creased. 'You're taking this very hard, Harry. What does this girl mean to you?'

He grappled with the ice, the knot in his gut, and the bitter ache in his chest. \'Fleur was supposed --- she was meant to *understand.* To be my *friend.* A real friend, one who wouldn't turn out like Ron, or Hermione, or Katie, or any of the rest of the people who just want me to be a hero when it's convenient and disappear when it's not!'

The ice spread across his chest, egged on by the little smooth, high voice in the back of head. *Albus Dumbledore*. *Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore.* The whispered name hovered in the midst of his rage like dense, freezing fog. *Once for every year he tried to get me killed.* Despair muffled his rage, a thick, dark blanket, like distant night clouds blotting out the stars one by one.

'You were right.\' Harry clenched his fists and dug his nails into his palm. \'I let them take advantage. I let them walk over me as if my goals and dreams didn't matter as much as theirs. I let them, because the way they looked at me made me feel like I was somebody important after all those years of being *nobody.* I deluded myself into playing the hero for people who'd trade away everything I gave them in a heartbeat just to win some small token for themselves.\'

The snake fled inside the neck of Salazar\'s robes.

*We're such wretched creatures.* Harry shoved the despair down beneath the ice to drown. *I don't need to be better than them. They*

*wouldn't even understand it. There's no reason not to chase my own*

*dream.*

\'I\'ll seize my dream and if I find anyone worthy of my trust and friendship along the way, then so be it.\' He took a deep breath. 'How can Dumbledore expect me to die for people like *this?'*

Salazar's gaze sharpened. 'Can you name a single one of them who'd die for you, Harry?'

*No.* A blizzard of ice swirled through his blood. *And I won't become nothing, not for a world that's done nothing for me.* He snatched the Marauders' Map from his pocket. *Where are you? You're always there when I look, Pettigrew. Where are you now?*

Pettigrew's name hovered in black ink beside the quidditch pitch just beyond the edge of the castle's wards. Harry took one look and dropped it on the table.

\'Where're you going?\' Salazar asked. 'You need to be careful,

Harry...'

Harry struggled for words. \'I\'m the Heir of Slytherin.\' Salazar's

words found their way onto his tongue when none of his own appeared. \'I'm not a sacrifice for lesser wizards. I *refuse* to be sacrificed for people --- for people like *them*.\' He took a deep breath and forced the ice back into a cold point beneath his ribs. 'They don't deserve it. They don't deserve a hero. And they're not going to get one.'

# Splat the Rat

Wet grass whispered beneath Harry's feet. The fading sun crept behind a veil of grey cloud, leaving the pines a ragged line of dark beyond the looming quidditch hoops and stands.

A short shadow lurked, twitching beneath the trees.

*Pettigrew.*

Something within the ball of ice in Harry's chest uncoiled and reared its head; its eyes slid open, full of furious, focused hunger. His uncle's insults, the quiet spite of his aunt, Dudley's learnt disgust, the fickle words of his friends in the magical world, the crunch as Hermione shattered his wand, and every moment the emptiness had fed on crumbled away.

*I won't become nothing.*

He disillusioned himself.

Sharp, sweet pine resin drifted to his nose. Harry smeared the sap on his fingertips and traced light lines of stickiness onto his face and the back of his neck. *No warning. No mercy. Just like how he turned on his friends.*

\'Incarcerous,\' Harry hissed.

Thin, barbed wires snared the rat in a net of steel, cutting into his skin. Hoarfrost coated the metal, lacing it with icy spines.

\'Were you waiting for someone?\' Harry dispelled his invisibility. \'Another hapless student to hide with? A trusting friend to betray?\'

\'Harry.\' Pettigrew\'s voice wavered somewhere between relief and

fear. 'I thought you were Sirius.' 'I'm not.\'

*This isn't even vengeance. It's for me, not for my parents, not for my friends, not to save anyone, or anything.* A small smile crept onto his lips. *Just. Me.*

\'What're you going to do?\' Wormtail whined, twisting within the wires. Tiny trickles of red marred his pale, dirt-smeared skin. \'Your parents would never want you to do something cruel and the wires are tight, Harry. They're *hurting*.\'

\'You know something, Peter?\' Harry forced a bright smile onto his face. Hope flickered in Pettigrew's eyes and in the eye of Harry's mind, amidst the ice and beneath the razor-sharp gaze, lips curled back from needle-like teeth. \'I don\'t think that the dead want anything. They're gone. *Nothing*.\'

Pettigrew whimpered. 'Please, Harry. *Please.*'

Harry let the warmth fade from his smile and the cold creep in. \'I

want something. Would you like to know what it is?'

\'Revenge won\'t bring them back, Harry. If it did, I\'d\'ve turned the Dark Lord\'s wand against him the first chance I got. They were two of five people that ever cared about me. I was never brilliant like any of them, but they cared for me all the same. I wish, more than anything, that I\'d remembered how to be brave when the Dark Lord found me. He was searching for Sirius and thought I might know where he was. I wish I\'d died then, and been remembered as well as I was for thirteen years, but I didn\'t, I wasn\'t, and I just want to *live*.\'

\'I spent eleven years wishing for parents, for *anyone*.\' Sweet malice dripped from Harry's tongue. \'Wishes like that, they just *don\'t come true*.\'

The slim, ebony shape of his wand slipped from his sleeve again; eleven and a third inches of intent.

\'If you kill me, Sirius will never have his name cleared! Take me to

the aurors, to Dumbledore, to Azkaban, but kill me and he'll never be free.\'

Harry paused. *No. Sirius didn\'t try to capture Pettigrew and clear his name.* The cold creature coiled tight around his heart and sank its sharp teeth in deep. *Sirius wanted him dead. He deserves to die. I need him to die. He\'s already dead to the world.* Harry\'s grip on his wand tightened. *He dies.*

\'Harry,\' Pettigrew whispered. \'Harry, *please*.\'

A point of bright green light swelled from the tip of Harry's wand as he placed it between Pettigrew\'s eyes. \'Do you know what the first two words I remember are?\'

Wormtail shook his head, squirming within the wires.

Harry's lips curved into a broad half-smile. 'Avada kedavra.'

A blinding green flash threw sharp shadows of the pine trees across the blank face of Peter Pettigrew.

*And now it's time to seize my freedom. From Dumbledore. From Riddle. From all the selfish people who expect everything and give nothing back.* Harry pictured the last page of Riddle's notes and the two words at the centre of the page. Six letters, then four; the latter carved into the parchment. *Listen*. *Pain.*

Harry closed his eyes and sought for the magic. The pine trees melted into nothing, the sound of their needles, the whisper and touch of the breeze, and the smell of the resin all faded from thought.

A thousand ink-black fragments screamed within him. They whispered, howled, gibbered and cried in deafening silence, but blotted out even the beat of Harry's heart with their cacophony.

*One of them's not me. One of them's him.*

He concentrated on each individual fragment, listening to the screams of each shard of the broken mirror that was his soul. More different, distorted, reflections of himself than he could've ever dreamt of swirled through his mind's eye. *All the possible outcomes from the event of fracturing your soul and sense of self, if Riddle's to be believed. Every in between, from fully recovering to never healing.*

Harry sought through them for the boy he'd seen within the diary, or the man he might've become. Countless pairs of green eyes started back. Doubt trickled into his thoughts, welling up in the pit of his stomach like thick, cold tar.

*No. It's here. I'll find it.*

He embraced each image of himself as they came, until, eventually, one came with an echo. A cold-eyed, bright-smiling Harry with tousled, messy hair, no different from a hundred others, yet with a susurration of something else.

Red eyes gleamed behind green.

*They deserve nothing.* A smooth, high little voice whispered into

Harry's ear as fast as broom-flight. *They're nothing. And it's us or them.*

*Out.* Harry seized the fragment. *Get out. You're not me. You're not!*

He set himself and *tore.* A torrent of agony washed over him. The ice shattered and melted beneath its weight.

*It has to go.* Harry steeled himself and ripped again.

Something gave. The fragments screamed, so high his ears rang.

The sound ripped through him like a rusted nail down a pane of glass. Harry screamed until his throat tore and a thick, metallic tang coated his tongue. His wand turned searing hot in his fist.

*It hurts. It hurts so much.*

A thick, hot liquid rolled down his face. In the reflection of Pettigrew\'s dead eyes, he watched ebony tears crawl to his chin. They left trails of dark down his cheeks like run mascara and dripped to the floor, spattering in poisonous hisses and rising as a thick, swirling, black smoke.

Each tear drove the nail's tip deeper through the glass; its shriek

cut through Harry like Petunia's kitchen knives sawing through skin.

*It has to come out. I refuse to die. I refuse.* He swallowed down a mouthful of coppery liquid and shoved the nail all the way.

The glass tore apart like wet paper in the fists of a giant; shattering with a screech that pierced through him like lance.

White sparks burst before Harry's eyes as he clutched at his ears.

*Fuck. It might've been better to die.*

He opened his eyes into loam and needles, curled up into a ball, covered in dirt, and surrounded by clawed ground. Sharp, sweet pine resin reached his nose with the tang of roasted flesh.

Silence closed over him like dusk.

*It's done.*

Searing waves of pain burst from his wand-hand. Harry stifled a scream into his forearm. The cracked, blackened flesh of his wand-hand surrounded unmarred, slender ebony. He glimpsed bone in the cracks of his charred flesh.

*Don't panic. It has to be fixable. Madam Pomfrey regrew my*

*bones.*

Harry staggered to his feet and tugged his wand out of the ruin of

his right hand. A new wave of pain washed across his palm as a chunk of flesh the size of a galleon came away with the wand.

*I need to get rid of the body.* He pushed his wand into his left hand and set Pettigrew's body on fire, sending it flying into the Forbidden Forest with a blasting curse. His magic guttered out and he sank to one knee. *And I need to get to the hospital wing.*

Harry focused as hard as he could on the very top stair of the steps from the Chamber of Secrets, mustering what little of his magic he could find, and willed himself there.

The world twisted back past him and he collapsed out of the stairs onto the still soaking floor of Myrtle\'s bathroom. The water burnt like acid; its sting cleared some of the fog from his thoughts.

He clawed a little more magic forth and disillusioned himself with his left hand, stumbling toward the infirmary. Dark spots swirled before his eyes as he shouldered the doors open and let his charm drop.

\'Mr Potter!\' Madam Pomfrey's heels clattered toward him. 'Madam Pomfrey,' Harry croaked, darkness creeping in at the

corners of his vision.

The world swam.

\'Drink this.'

A cold, glass bottle pressed against his lips and something vile and peppery flooded down his throat. His next breath came so cold it felt like he\'d swallowed ice and he gasped.

\'Sweet Merlin!\' Madam Pomfrey exclaimed. \'What did you do to your *hand?\'*

\'I burnt it.\' Harry stared into the weeping, seeping cracks in his

palm; each throb felt like a hammer's strike. 'Badly.'

\'What *with!?* I haven\'t seen burns like this since the last war. If I find out you were trying to cast *Fiendfyre*, Mr Potter...\'

\'I wasn\'t.\'

\'Then how, *exactly*, did you do this?\' Madam Pomfrey ran her wand tip over his mutilated hand.

The flesh and skin began to creep back over the bone, filling in the horrible, pink cracks. Charred flesh crumbled to dust.

*Think of something. Fire. Fire?* Harry clawed through his thoughts. Flames swirled in them and the horntail's jagged, tattered wings loomed behind it. *Dragon. The egg.*

\'The golden egg was guarded by a dragon. I thought fire might make it reveal its secrets.\'

\'That was incredibly stupid of you.' She seized his chin. 'Another minute of whatever fire that was and you'd've have lost this hand, Mr Potter.'

\'And there wasn't even a hint of the tongue of Mordor,\' Harry

joked.

Whoever was in the bed next to him laughed.

\'You\'re healed.\' She sighed and tucked her wand away. \'I would insist you remain here for the night, so I can keep an eye on you after you exhausted most of your magic with whatever you were doing, but I doubt you\'d stay.\'

\'Already?\' Harry flexed his hand. 'Seems as good as new.'

\'Yes, Mr Potter, already. Now go. And this time take more care. I distinctly remember telling you that I did not want to see you here again at the beginning of the year.\'

'If you insist.' He staggered toward the door.

The cool of the potion he'd drunk faded from his chest, leaving a

deep, throbbing ache in his limbs and eyelids as heavy as lead.

*I think I failed. I blacked out before I could do anything with the horcrux. I need to speak to Salazar.*

Harry retraced his steps to the chamber.

\'You came back,\' Salazar called. 'What did you do, Harry?'

\'I fractured my soul.\' A strange, numb feeling caught hold of him,

an even, flat calm. 'I found the horcrux and I tore it away.'

\'And?\' Salazar peered down from the wall with a deep frown.

'What did you do with it?'

'I'm not sure.' He *listened*, searching once more through the screams of his soul fragments, but could not find the image with the echo.

\'How can you not know?\' Salazar demanded. \'You ripped it out, didn\'t you?\'

\'I *might* have,\' Harry muttered, remembering the sticky, tar-like tears and the swirling smoke. He shuddered. \'I lost control, it *hurt.*\'

\'Can you feel it?\' Salazar asked. \'If you have a horcrux linked to you, you should be able to feel it. Anchoring your sense of self to an object must create some kind of association with it. Do you have any sort of feeling, warmth, familiarity, or association that wasn't there before?\'

Harry relaxed and let his mind turn blank. The warm cloth of his robes brushed against his skin, the faint heat of his wand pressed against his forearm, and the cool of the chamber seeped in through the soles of his feet. \'No. There\'s nothing.\'

\'Then it's either destroyed, or, more likely, it returned to something it was already linked to.\'

A faint trill traced down Harry's spine. \'Something it was linked

to?\'

\'Can you feel the piece of Tom Riddle\'s soul within you?\'

\'No.'

Salazar stroked his chin. \'I would hazard a guess that a living

horcrux ties the sense of self of the two individuals *together* rather than anchoring the creator's consciousness and magic to the body as a physical object. If you've torn that bond from yourself and not tethered it to another object, then you ought to be free.\'

'Ought to be?\'

\'This sort of soul magic isn't my area of expertise. However, no consciousness can survive alone untethered. If you can't sense anything, then you've not anchored your own consciousness and magic to create a horcrux of your own. I would imagine Tom was right and you would have to be very attached to the object to begin with, so whatever was lying

about nearby wouldn't work anyway.' He shrugged. 'I think it leaves only

one option.\'

\'I\'d like to know what you think that is.' Harry shot him a long stare. 'You're playing very coy, which means either you think it's very bad or it's some kind of compliment. I'm too tired to play a hundred and one questions, Salazar.'

\'I think you accomplished exactly what you wanted.' Salazar patted the head of his serpent companion and cracked a broad grin. 'You tore Voldemort's anchor free, ripping your own soul out of necessity.

However, you did nothing to anchor your sense of self and magic to an object, so I believe Voldemort's anchor was cut free and the horcrux destroyed.'

*He's not been wrong yet.* Harry released a long sigh and some of the deep, sore ache faded from his bones. *I\'m free. I'm free.*

He grinned. \'Looks like you\'ll have to put up with having an heir who acts like Godric a little longer than I thought you would.'

Salazar's green eyes softened. \'A tragedy I remain unable to

correct.'

\'So what now?\' Harry murmured.

\'Focus on the tournament,\' Salazar said. *\'Win it*. The experience of

using magic outside a classroom and in dangerous or testing circumstances will be invaluable. You will be far stronger for it.\'

\'Of course.\' A small cold smile found its way onto his lips as he

imagined outstripping the other champions. 'Winning will taste sweet.'

*See if Fleur can avoid that*.

\'You\'ll need to learn the charms to reverse self-transfigurations in case you make a mistake with your lungs. It\'s simple enough, an extension on the priori incantatem, actually.\'

\'It is?\'

\'That charm detects the rough strength, flow, and intent of the piece of magic used, like looking at the dried up bed of a river and estimating how big it gets in spring, then attempts to cast its opposite. There're many different forms of it used by various specialists, including healers.\'

\'You know a lot of healing magic?\'

\'Snakes are not just associated with biting people,\' Salazar muttered. \'They were a symbol of healing and longevity before that was forgotten. I was never as gifted as Helga, she could use that charm to cure almost anything, but I was better than most. My skill at healing kept my wife alive for years longer than we thought possible after my other friends had passed.\'

'You were the last one?\'

\'Rowena fell ill after her daughter was killed.\' Salazar's eyes turned distant. \'Godric was killed in a duel, searching for some wand he deemed too dangerous to be left in the hands of others when he was far too old for such things, the idiot. Helga died peacefully in her sleep just a couple of years before my wife. Mundane, in the end, weren\'t we? You can't escape death, greater wizards than I have tried, and those who do are often consumed by it. Tom was.\'

\'And you? Did you try?'

\'I was consumed,\' Salazar whispered. \'My search for a way to circumvent the barrier of death took *everything*. I died searching from my

bed, too frail to do anything more than think and hope that my daughter might succeed in my place, unable to give up.\'

\'Did she succeed?\'

\'I wouldn't know. I was enchanted to carry the knowledge of my original self from death. Anything that happened after that point I've needed to learn from an outside source. You, or Tom.\'

Harry blinked. \'We were the only ones?\' He shook his head. 'But it's been a *thousand* years...'

\'It only takes our shared blood to open this chamber, but it takes more to want to find it. I overlooked that when I made it, assuming all my family members would be as I was and for a thousand years my only company was the basilisk.\'

\'I thought you might have turned the other away,\' Harry murmured. \'Found them unsuitable.\'

\'Found them *unsuitable?*\' Deep lines marred Salazar's brows. \'They would've been my *family*. My *legacy*. You are as alike to Godric as me, an irony of time you can't fully appreciate, but I didn't turn you away just because you're not identical to myself. That's not how family *works*.\'

Harry swallowed a small hot lump of emotion. *It was how my family worked.*

\'Sorry,\' he said.

\'Apology accepted. It was not, I think, a mistake entirely of your

making, and not the first time I've been so accused.\'

Harry chewed that over with no little unease. \'Tom said the same

thing?\'

\'I told you that you were similar,\' Salazar said. \'It takes a crucible of terrible calibre to forge a person of such strength. The greatest wizards and witches are always born from adversity. Every single one you name suffered and grew stronger for it. Some chose to rise above their pain and fears, others embraced them and chose revenge. They all had a drive that made them great.\'

\'Tom Riddle succumbed.'

\'No.\' An odd smile hovered on Salazar's lips. \'Tom learnt to let go of the things that hurt him. He remembered his mistakes and he refused to repeat them. The world hurt him. Over and over and over. He got back up every time. Something else drove him. It ate away at him, day by day, until there was almost nothing left of the boy who found me.' Salazar sighed. \'It doesn't matter now. What he's become is more important to you than the path that led him there.\'

\'He can't be allowed to return.\'

\'Tom was rarely stopped from getting what he wanted. And neither of us knows how he intends to return.\'

\'The book was singularly unhelpful on that.' Harry poked the old tome with his finger, grimacing at the ache in his arm. 'I need to rest for a bit. I'm absolutely shattered.'

\'Forget Tom and Dumbledore for a short while, Harry,' Salazar murmured. 'Focus on yourself as much as you can, while you still can. If you dedicate your life to escaping the fate they've planned for you, then you'll be as lost in victory as you'd be in defeat. Survival's important, but there's more to life than just being alive.'

Harry turned away from the painting and stared into the small

gold hourglass dangling from the hook on the desk. 'I know.'

*How could I not?* He smothered the emptiness before its claws cut too deep. Exhaustion sapped some of the hunger from the void; its fog clouded his mind, muffling the feeling like voices in mist. *One day, I'll be free of this nothingness, too. And then I'll never let it touch me again.*

# A Sirius Conversation

Sheets of yellow parchment floated around him, shrouding him from Salazar's piercing stare. Colourful, careful-penned illustrations of muscles, bones, tendons, and tissues drifted over one another as the sheets drew together into a single flying stack. The black-inked curves of the human rib cage hovered at the forefront, stretching from Harry's waist to just above his head.

'I think I've wrapped my head around all this anatomy stuff now.' He tapped it with the tip of his wand and the piece of parchment faded from sight to reveal a red-penned diagram of the muscles connecting the bones. 'Can't remember all the names, but I can picture it in my head.'

*Who'd've thought the human body was so complex? Good thing I'm not trying to mess with my brain.*

Harry flicked his wand at the floating paper and watched them fold back into the cover of the book on the desk. 'What do you think, Salazar? Time to actually do some magic?'

Salazar peered down at him from the wall. His serpent wriggled up from his shoulders onto his neck. \'Transfigure your thumbnail into something different first.'

Harry shot the painting a flat stare. 'It's only just started growing back.' He poked the small sliver of nail growing on the top of his thumb. 'See?'

\'So nobody will notice if it\'s still missing.\' The founder sighed and pushed his snake's head down out of his line of sight. 'You'd best learn to reverse the effects of transfiguration upon yourself *before* you start tampering.\'

\'Can\'t I just transfigure something else? It seems a bit unwise to

test things on myself...'

\'It\'s a general counter-spell to revert a botched transfiguration upon a person.\' Salazar plucked the snake from about his shoulders and dropped it into the bottom of the painting. 'Wretched reptile, will you not stay still for even a few minutes!'

Harry pictured smooth, gleaming metal and tapped his half- returned thumbnail with the tip of his wand. It turned cold as ice and to bright steel.

\'Shiny,\' Salazar muttered, poking his snake's head back down when it tried to climb back up. 'Because that doesn't completely defeat the whole point of choosing the part of you that was already missing so people wouldn't notice you'd been experimenting with magic.\'

\'What\'s the incantation?\' Harry asked. 'February's already started, there's not long until the task. I need to get started if I don't want to watch Fleur Delacour win again.'

\'Redeo. Don't focus on changing anything specific, we're relying on your intent being your own subconscious self-image, so your magic reverts you to how you normally are.\' Salazar leant forward and tied his serpent into a complex knot with a satisfied grin. 'It's not a fix-all by any means, but it could save your life if you really botch it.'

'Redeo...\' Harry watched the painted serpent struggle and curl up into a ball between Salazar's feet. 'I think your snake is sulking.'

'Good.' Salazar poked it with his toe. 'Damn thing hasn't stayed so still in about a century.'

Harry snorted. 'If I were a suspicious person, I'd say Godric sabotaged the enchantments on your portrait.'

Salazar's eyes flashed. 'Of course! Oh, it all makes *sense* now. Damn that over-sized, red-bearded baby. He's probably been giggling to himself in the afterlife for the last thousand years! Forget that nonsense about that Finger of Keres, Deathstick wand, I bet he really died laughing at my expense.'

Harry chuckled and pictured how he usually looked. 'Redeo.'

His nail faded to a healthy pink. Harry tapped it with the tip of his wand and frowned at the ring of steel. *Not quite.*

Salazar smirked. \'At least it's less conspicuous. Try again. Make sure you're thinking about reverting and not about what you want yourself to be reverted to. You need to let your subconscious fill in that part of your intent.\'

*Revert.* Harry fixed the word in the middle of all his thoughts.

'Redeo.' He tapped his metal nail with his wand.

The nail spread to fill the whole void on the top of his thumb. Harry poked it. *Success.*

\'That\'s more like it.' Salazar waved his wand at the book on the desk. 'Now you can have a try transfiguring yourself.'

'Good. There's only a week and half left to master it, remove any teething problems, and get used to breathing so differently.\'

'You\'ll need water to breathe afterward.\' A broad smirk crept onto Salazar's face. 'That means it's time for you to get reacquainted with the pool...'

*Not this time.* Harry hauled the painting off the wall and strode out of the study and across the bridge. He poured magic into a warming charm until the pool of water steamed.

Salazar's face fell. 'Spoilsport.'

'I've decided not to jump headfirst into things without at least a bit of thinking first.\' Harry pulled off his shoes and socks, then dipped a toe in. 'Bath temperature. Excellent.'

'Try not to drown yourself,\' Salazar said. 'That French girl will win if you do.'

'I don't need any extra motivation to beat her.' Harry stripped off his robes and sat on the tip of the forked-ended bridge, then lowered the bridge with his wand until the water reached his jaw. He took a deep breath.

*They're going to see me win. All of them. Fleur Delacour. Ron.*

*Hermione. Katie. Dumbledore. Even Malfoy. I won't just disappear whenever they fancy. I'm here to stay.*

\'Are you ready?\' Salazar's green eyes softened. 'This will probably feel very strange and uncomfortable. Just make sure you don't panic, if you panic, you might not manage to cast the counter spell well enough.'

Harry placed the tip of his wand over his chest. He pictured the small sacs that were his alveoli lengthening into long, wavy filaments, transforming his lungs into something he imagined resembled the tendrils of an anemone.

He took a deep breath, sucking air into his lungs.

No sense of relief came. The urge to breathe rose like the tide.

Harry ducked his head under the water and inhaled a lungful of lukewarm liquid. The urge faded and his thoughts cleared. *It works!*

He tried to exhale but the water hung heavy in his lungs. *Shit.*

Harry strained them until his chest burnt and a metallic taste crept onto his

tongue. *It doesn't work.* Black spots swirled before his eyes. *Definitely*

*doesn't work.*

\'Redeo,\' he croaked, spluttering water everywhere.

Harry coughed up several mouthfuls of liquid and drew in huge gulps of cool air. His lungs and throat burnt and stung like an open graze.

\'I take it that it didn't work?\' Salazar's brow creased. 'Are you okay, Harry?'

\'I can\'t get the water out of my lungs once I\'ve breathed it in. I'm using up all the oxygen in the water I inhale and then running out because I can't get the old water out and new water in.\'

Salazar's frown deepened. \'You\'d best return to the library, then. I can\'t help you here. You need to alter the muscles between and below your ribs to help move the water in and out, but without detailed study you could end up pinching an important blood vessel near your heart or something like that.\'

\'Back to the library,\' Harry grumbled. 'Hermione's probably in there still. She and Viktor Krum seem to have taken up permanent residence.'

Salazar grinned. 'Don't forget the French girl. Didn't you say she visits a fair bit, too?'

*I've not forgotten her.*

'She sticks to the enchanting section, which is on the far side of the room.' A little ice crept into his heart. 'Probably just to avoid me. Even Viktor Krum and Hermione at least say good morning.'

\'Can't be helped,' Salazar murmured. 'You're in a competition, Harry. Not everyone will fight fair. If you want to win, you'll have to fight fire with fire from time to time.'

*With water.* Harry pursed his lips. *If there was any truth in anything she told me, her magic might be hindered in this task.*

'You should probably get dressed before you leave,' Salazar added. 'You're unpopular enough as it is without scarring an entire generation of children. Even my basilisk wouldn't be able to drive everyone out of the castle as fast as seeing you prancing mostly naked through the corridors will.'

'At least I *have* a body.' Harry glowered at the portrait's smirk. 'And I'm much less skinny now I've done that ritual.'

'Are you sure you don't want to try it again?' Salazar quipped. 'Are you sure you don't want me to bring Sir Cadogan down here

to keep you company?'

Salazar shuddered. 'Gods, no. I've heard enough about him from you.' He plucked his knotted serpent up from the base of his painting. 'Not unless he's coming to take away this useless creature.'

Harry pulled his robes back on. 'I think, if it came to a fight

between the two of them, the snake would win fairly comfortably.'

\'Actually.' Salazar waved his armful of snake around until Harry turned to fully face him. \'Before you leave, I should teach you a very useful charm. There're plenty of things that you don\'t want or need others to discover and this piece of magic can be enormously useful in managing that. Just make sure not to use it on anyone innocent or important until you've mastered it.\'

\'What\'s the spell?\'

\'The memory charm!'

*Lockhart's sole talent.* Harry quirked an eyebrow. *I wonder what happened to him.*

\'I know the incantation and wand action,' he said. 'I've seen it used to great effect, too.'

\'You need to know exactly what you are removing, otherwise, you could end up doing significant damage,\' Salazar said. 'It\'s almost impossible to remove events that have great meaning or importance on a permanent basis, Harry. The mind forms many connections and associations to them, so they eventually resurface. Once an idea is ingrained, it can be very hard to get rid of, so the sooner the charm is performed the better. Focus on wiping something clean, a board, a window, any such visualisation will work. Mastering it will take some time, but once you've mastered removing, we can move onto modifying memories. That allows you to work around some of the problems I just mentioned.\'

\'How exactly am I to practice this?\' Harry asked. 'I'm *not* testing it

on myself.'

Salazar's eyes turned distant and he stroked his goatee. 'I wonder

what would happen?'

'*Significant damage*, I'd imagine...'

Salazar shrugged and spread his hands. 'Progress comes hand in hand with risk.'

Harry raised an eyebrow. 'There're plenty of things I'd like to forget. Naked Dudley. Half-naked Aunt Petunia. Completely naked Uncle Vernon. That time you went off on a rant-tangent last week and thought it'd be fine to tell a fourteen year old about Godric's experiment with self-

transfiguration in a brothel. In *far* more detail than anyone should've ever spoken aloud.'

*Katie. Fleur.* Harry shivered. *Tearing my soul apart.*

Salazar coughed into his hand and studied his fingernails. \'Well, once you've grasped the idea and method, you can ask someone to let you test it once for a small memory and then do it over and over again.\' Salazar chuckled. \'They\'ll never notice.\'

Harry hefted the painting back over the bridge and onto the wall above the door. \'I\'ll head to the library, then. I may have to raid the forbidden section, so I'll probably come down here to practice.\'

He swept through the empty corridors, taking the long route round the quiet top floors, and slipping through the lunch crowd into the library.

'Harry.' Viktor Krum glanced up from his books. 'Back again.'

'Viktor.' Harry shot him half a smile. 'Still hoarding all the transfiguration books, I see.'

Hermione glanced between the two of them, chewing her lip.

'Harry---'

'I'll see you around, Viktor.' He gave Hermione a short nod and

picked his way along the shelf on magical water creatures until he found a few that mentioned anatomy.

\'Y-you\'re looking at water creatures, too,' Neville muttered.

Harry whirled, slipping his wand from his sleeve.

Neville squeaked. 'S-sorry, Harry.'

\'I am looking at water creatures.\' Harry tucked his wand back out of sight. \'Sorry, Neville, I didn\'t mean to startle you.\'

Neville's face crumbled. \'I\'m e-easily startled.'

\'What are you doing here?\' Harry studied the bags under his eyes and the creases in his shirt and robes. 'You look like you need a nap. A long one.'

\'Returning a book. Or I was, until I saw you over here.\'

\'And now?\' Harry flicked through the pages of the small stack of books he'd found until he discovered a diagram of a grindylow's lungs. 'I'm kind of busy, Neville.'

\'I was g-going to m-make you an offer.\' Neville squirmed. \'I thought it might b-be the best way to s-speak with you.\'

\'What kind of offer?\'

*And what can you offer me?*

'H-hermione's been checking out and reading books to do with water creatures and transfiguration in her attempt to help *Viktor Krum*.\' A touch of anger coloured Neville's tone.

\'The second task's underwater.' Harry threw a glance through the bookshelves toward the far side of the library and caught a flash of silver a dozen rows away. His heart lurched. 'I'm fairly sure all four of us know.'

\'What do you know about Gillyweed?\' Neville asked.

*Gill-yweed, huh.*

\'I assume I might find it useful.\'

\'It would let you breathe underwater with ease. I don\'t know where you\'d find any on such short notice, though. It grows in the Mediterranean and isn\'t normally harvested until summer.\'

\'I have a way of breathing underwater,\' Harry said. \'I just need to perfect it.\'

\'Oh.\' Neville's eyes dropped to his shoes. 'S-sorry, Harry. I thought I m-might've found something useful for you.'

*You don't seem very happy, Nev.* Harry ran his eyes over the muscle diagram and slipped the book into the pocket of his robes. *And I've stumbled across something that seems useful earlier than I expected.*

\'That doesn\'t mean I can\'t help you, Nev,' he said.

Nev shuffled his feet. \'Y-you would?\'

'Within reason. I do have the tournament to consider.\'

\'Of course, I understand. I was h-hoping you\'d h-help me with, w- well, e-everything,\' Neville muttered. A deep flush crept up his neck onto his face. \'E-everyone calls me a s-squib and I c-can\'t ever seem to g-get anything right. You improved so m-much since last year and I hoped you\'d help me, too. I w-won't end up really good at anything, I never am, but I don't want to be the *worst* anymore.\'

\'Everything,\' Harry murmured. \'Have you asked Hermione? She likes helping people.\'

*Well, she likes it when people ask her for help. She feels needed.*

'She's too busy helping Krum to speak to anyone in Gryffindor

outside of classes and the other guys are all into quidditch and stuff.\'

*They left you on your own*. Harry saw, for a brief moment, a shadow of himself in Neville Longbottom's face. *I wonder, if I leave you to*

*drown alone, too, will you end up a bit like me?* His lips twisted into a grimace. *But that would be cruel beyond words, to knowingly feed another person to the emptiness. I'm not Fleur.*

\'I\'ll help you,\' Harry said. \'Weekends, between lunch and dinner on one day, for however long you like. Meet me on the seventh floor at the top of the stairs after the second task. I\'ll help you, Nev.\'

\'Thanks, Harry.\' Neville straightened up a little.

*He's as tall as I am when he's not all hunched over.*

\'I\'m only helping you help yourself,\' Harry said. 'I'll be there, but you've got to try. Things don't just *happen,* you have to make them happen.'

\'At least you're helping,\' Neville muttered. \'Ron, Seamus, and Dean; they don\'t care. They just laugh at me when things go wrong. It\'s like we're not even friends.\'

\'You can find new friends, Nev. You\'ll find equals, people who understand you.\' Salazar\'s words slipped from his tongue and Fleur's bright, blue eyes shone before the eye of Harry's mind. 'Just be careful, them understanding doesn't mean they've got your best interests at heart.'

\'That\'s what you\'re doing. You\'re being yourself.\' Envy burnt in

Neville's eyes like an open flame.

\'There\'s nobody else we can be.\' Harry chose his words with great care. 'If you try and be someone else, because you think that's what you should be, or you want to be what they want you to be, you'll end up miserable.'

\'Thanks, Harry.' Neville straightened his robes and tie. 'Seriously,

mate.'

A small grey ball of feathers squeezed through the narrow crack

of the window and plunged into Harry's chest. *Sirius\' owl.*

'I'll catch you later, Nev.' Harry plucked the letter out of the owl's

grasp and released the tiny ball of damp feathers.

He watched Nev's back retreat down the row of shelves, then unfolded the letter. *The Shrieking Shack. Today*. Black ink smeared the folds and stained Harry's fingers. He balled the letter up and stuffed it into his pocket with the book on grindylows. *One solution's enough*.

Harry replaced the other books and checked the Marauders\' Map.

His godfather\'s name hovered beneath the picture of the Whomping Willow.

*It must be important if he's already there waiting*.

He hurried out of the library and down the corridor overlooking the greenhouses, scattering second years on their way to Herbology. He paused before the tree. Its branches were still as stone.

*Either Sirius has already pressed the knot, or it's lying in wait.*

\'Papilionis,\' he murmured.

The black-winged, delicate butterfly fluttered toward the tree. A branch the width of Harry\'s body hammered it into the ground.

*Lying in wait, then.*

Harry levitated a small piece of wood from underneath the trunk of the tree and pressed the button, slipping into the passageway. Sirius stood just inside in clean, plain black robes.

\'Harry!\' His godfather grinned and wrapped him in a tight hug. Harry grimaced at the sudden warmth. *He's put on some weight.*

\'I managed to return to my family\'s awful old home.\' Sirius stepped back. \'I\'d offer to show you, but it\'s under the Fidelius and really not very homely. Perhaps in a year, when that miserable house-elf has managed to restore the place to as close to a liveable standard as it will ever get.\'

\'Is it safe? A bit of dirt's less trouble than dementors.'

\'Fidelius Charm,\' Sirius said. \'There\'s few things that are safer.\' \'Who\'s the secret keeper? Someone trustworthy?\'

Sirius flinched. \'Dumbledore, I'd like to see anyone try and get the

secret out of him.\'

Harry swallowed his reservations. \'That\'s good.'

*It probably is good. Dumbledore will save Sirius. It's me who's the*

*sacrifice.*

\'I didn\'t come here to talk about how safe I was.\' Sirius drew back.

\'I want to know what\'s going on. There\'s no way to send an owl to where I\'m staying without knowing the location and Dumbledore was adamant that he wasn't going to tell anybody yet.\'

Harry took a long, deep breath and offered Sirius a small smile.

\'Everything's changed.'

\'It seemed that way. You were a boy last year when I came after Pettigrew, now you walk and speak like you aged a decade in eight months.\'

\'I suppose I've grown up,\' Harry said. \'I wasn\'t strong enough, Sirius. Every year I\'ve been thrown into some new situation and each time I\'ve escaped by the skin of my teeth and because of others. That won\'t *last*.\'

\'You aren\'t *meant* to be strong at fourteen, Harry.' Shadows lurked in Sirius' grey eyes. 'Someone your age... you've done well to *survive*. It's unfair to expect yourself to be stronger than most adult wizards and witches.'

\'I have to be.\' Harry shrugged. \'My enemies aren't fourteen and they're not going to wait for me to grow up, either.\'

'I guess that's true.\' Sirius sighed. 'Just try not to get too focused on it, ok. You need to be doing normal, fourteen year old boy stuff.' A brief grin flashed across his face. 'Chasing seventh year girls who're *way* out of your league, bantering about quidditch, trying to quietly masturbate in the dorm without any of the other guys noticing and---'

'Let's stop there, shall we?' Harry screwed up his face. 'For my

sake.'

Sirius tilted his head back and laughed. 'That's more like it.' His

humour faded. 'I do wish that was all you had to worry about.'

Harry swallowed a hot, bitter, knot of feeling. \'Wishes like that

don\'t come true.'

Sirius sighed. 'Tell me what\'s happened since your last letter,

then.\'

\'A lot,\' Harry whispered. A flash of green light and Peter

Pettigrew\'s empty eyes passed through his thoughts. 'A lot.'

Sirius' grey eyes darkened. \'It doesn\'t sound like it was good.'

\'Some of it was.'

*I'm free. I don't have to die. I just have to make sure nothing kills*

*me.*

\'Tell me about that stuff, then, Harry.'

'Well, I\'ve learnt so much more this year than any past one. My new wand's perfect for me. I have dreams that I couldn't have before.\' His face darkened. \'It cost me the friends who didn\'t understand I'm not some jack-in-the-box hero who'll just vanish after solving all their problems. I\'ve been all but alone.\'

\'I was alone in Azkaban.\' Shadows clustered in Sirius' grey eyes and in the deep lines of his face. \'There\'s nothing there to pull you out of the inside of your mind. The Dementors keep stirring your thoughts, pushing the most miserable, painful ones to the fore every time they draw near. It was enough to start eating away at my sanity and *I* knew I was innocent, so I'd something to cling to that they couldn\'t touch. The others... And Bella's bloody *singing...'* Sirius shuddered. 'You find something, an ideal or a goal, then you devote yourself to it and that's enough to stop the loneliness consuming you. Afterward, when everything else has fallen into place, you\'ll find yourself surrounded by people and not so alone as you thought. I came out with only the goal of killing Pettigrew. Now I have you and Remus.\'

\'Things get better,\' Harry murmured.

\'That\'s the only good thing about hitting the bottom, you know that there\'s no further to sink.' Sirius grinned. 'My mother said that to me when I was sorted into Gryffindor. She hated having a respectable, unbigoted child.\'

Harry snorted. 'Your school record's everything but respectable. I pray I'm in a different bed to the one you had at my age.'

Sirius laughed. \'I was by the window.'

'Shit.' Harry threw his hands up in the air. 'I should've known with

my luck.'

'How\'s the second task going?\' Sirius' eyes gleamed. 'I would've

*loved* to be in your shoes back in the day.'

\'I\'m going to transfigure myself. The task is underwater.\'

Sirius patted him on the shoulder with a firm hand. 'Exceptional stuff, Harry. I had your dad to drag me through transfiguration, but you must have inherited his knack for it. I hope you're thinking about giving becoming an animagus a shot. I wonder what you\'d be, another stag, like James, or maybe a bird, you seem even better at flying than your father was.\'

Harry transfigured the dirt into a couple of chairs and flopped back into one, lighting his wand with a murmured *lumos.* 'Maybe one day. Not right now, though.'

'It's useful.' Sirius dropped into his chair. 'Dead useful. But, yeah, no, it's a lot of effort and practice, so you should wait until after the tournament. Maybe give it a go in the summer?'

'Maybe.' Harry allowed himself a brief moment to picture Dudley skewered on his antlers. 'If it's safe.'

Sirius' face fell. 'Well. It's not really safe. Actually, it's not at all safe. And you don't have any mandrakes. *Damn*. That's a bit of a snag. Molly will skin me if she finds out I snuck you some, too.'

# Valentine Visitation

The wind tugged at Fleur's dress. Its shimmering silver thread rippled like sunlight off the sea. The world dropped away from her bare feet into darkness, gloom drifting past like thick winter fog. Countless tiny things swept past her in its haze.

'Strange.' Fleur reached a hand out into the dark.

A glass flower snagged on her fingers. Its petals glimmered yellow, white, blue, purple, red and back to yellow again.

'Gabby broke this years ago.' Fleur studied the flower's smooth

stem. *'Years*.' She let it drift into the dark.

Other little trinkets floated past. A bird of ice. A handful of wooden fish. Two trees of webbed stone, one dark, one light, each no taller than her hand.

'Long lost or broken things,' she murmured.

The tear-stained pages of a burnt journal eddied past her feet and a scatter of photos full of smiling girls swirled round her toes.

*Emilie, Caroline, and me.* A bitter heat curled around Fleur's heart.

*Long since burnt to ashes.* She swatted them away.

The gloom parted like a curtain. Countless figures wandered beneath her, strolling through an endless scatter of Fleur's creations, arm- in-arm, hand-in-hand, embracing, smiling, kissing, and never looking up. She knew them without seeing any of their faces; a parade of girls in blue robes and faceless boys.

A silver cup clattered to her feet, blurred words etched upon its

stem.

*My name.*

Fleur plucked it from the floor with a smile. 'I won.' She glanced down at the crowd below. 'I beat you all. Everything you *wanted* to be. I *am*.'

None of the figures looked up. The silver cup felt cold as ice beneath her fingers.

'I won,' she whispered. 'I *won.*'

*Didn't I?*

The crowd drifted away, leaving her upon the spire. And for a moment, as the last pair of them faded, she thought she glimpsed green eyes and a lopsided smile beside scruffy brown hair and chestnut eyes.

'Perfect.' Raw, ugly heat twisted the word into something sour. 'As always.'

She hurled the cup into the dark.

Quiet laughter echoed back. It rose like a wave, pouring over her like spilt ink, and her spire crumbled beneath her feet. Fleur jolted awake beneath her silver blanket.

Caroline's shrill laugh echoed from down the hall of the carriage.

A little heat seeped through Fleur's bones and feathers prickled just

beneath the surface of her skin.

'A stupid dream.' She kicked her blanket away and wriggled out. 'If I wanted a boy, I'd have one.' Fleur locked the door with a flick of her wand and ripped her nightdress off.

Pale skin stretched from her reflection's toes to her silver hair. Her

eyes slid along each curve. She ran the fingers of her left hand down over

the slight curve of her stomach between her thighs and brushed the fingertips of her right hand over her nipples.

*Veela are always beautiful.* She let a little of the heat in her bones creep out and watched the blue of her eyes darken to black. *On the outside, at least.*

'I look perfect. As always.' Fleur took a deep breath and let her hands fall to her sides. Her reflection's eyes faded back to sky blue. 'And I care more about real things than those shallow little girls. There will be someone who thinks the same.'

Green eyes flashed through her thoughts. *Someone who doesn't*

*hate me for enthralling them and violating their trust just to show I could.*

Fleur glanced at herself in the mirror again. 'Maybe if he saw me like this, he'd forget about that kiss and try to talk to me,' she murmured. A sigh slipped out through her lips. 'But then that would mean he's just as shallow as all the rest.'

*Don't think about it, Fleur.* She waved her wand at her wardrobe and let her underwear and school robes drape themselves over her. A thin strip of gauze tumbled from the pocket of her robes. Fleur caught it before her robes buttoned themselves closed and trapped it.

'Tempus.' She grimaced at the numbers that appeared. 'Still a little while until Gabby and Maman arrive.'

Fleur spread the gauze veil out on her bed and tapped her rosewood wand against her palm. 'As simple a solution as possible, like Harry and the toy dragon.' A small smile crept onto her lips. 'Let's see which of us has the best solution this time.'

*Most of the enchantments will weave together. Just not the one trapping the bubble, I'll have to put that on the other side so it doesn't mess with the rest.* She touched the tip of her wand to the gauze and

murmured the words for the ten enchantments she wished to imbue it with, folding them into one another until they formed a single blanket of magic.

*Not as good as anything goblin made, but their possessive, stubborn magic lends itself better to strong, lasting enchantments than any human magic does.*

She flipped the gauze over. 'And now for the ward.' Fleur drew a thin layer of her magic over the veil and let it seep into the threads upon the surface. 'There. That ought to do it.'

Fleur pursed her lips, strode into the bathroom, shoved the plug into the sink, and twisted open the tap. Water swirled into the basin, creeping up the porcelain. A single silver hair floated on its surface. She wrinkled her nose and plucked it out, letting a little magic through to turn the water on her fingers to steam and huffing the hair away.

'Test time.' Fleur dropped the veil into the sink and poked it

beneath the surface with the tip of her wand.

A long, thin bubble formed along one side of the gauze and a faint shimmer of magic danced upon the other.

'Perfect.' She smiled, tugged the plug out, and draped her gauze over the edge of the sink to dry. 'A little fragile, but more elegant than transfiguration or the bubble-head charm. And definitely better than choking down gillyweed.'

Fleur cast another tempus charm and frowned. *Still a little time left, but if I walk slowly, then I might not be waiting long. Even Gabby can't make maman too late.*

She disillusioned herself and stepped out into the corridor.

The other girls huddled around the tables of the communal room. Caroline and Emilie clutched a copy of the Daily Prophet, giggling at the picture of Fleur and Harry.

A little heat trickled through her bones and Fleur's fingers twitched toward her wand. *Not worth it. Who cares about plain, shallow, little girls living empty lives?*

A sharp, clear chill waited outside and a cloudless sky stretched overhead.

*Cold. Urgh.* Fleur cast three warming charms and waited for the heat to wrap itself around her like a blanket. *Much better.*

She wandered down from the castle into quaint, thatched buildings with frosted windows and bright-painted doors.

Shops lined the main street between the two inns. Pink-framed windows and heart-scattered white doors loomed near the centre, pink cushions, napkins, walls, and chairs clustered within. Near thirty couples crammed themselves inside.

*A bit much pink.* Fleur glanced at the sign. *Madam Puddifoot has terrible taste.*

A familiar scatter of brown hair appeared from the doorway of a shop half a dozen windows down the hill.

*Katie Bell.* Fleur tracked the English girl across the street. *Another shallow little girl.* She watched Katie dart across the street to link arms with another dark-haired Gryffindor. Fleur\'s heart plunged down into her stomach. *Harry went back to her after she hurt him.* Heat bubbled in her bones and feathers prickled at her skin. *He didn't even try to talk to me.*

The dark-haired Gyffindor twisted to peer into a window and Fleur caught a glimpse of brown eyes and a full chest. A swooping, flood of relief carried Fleur\'s heart back up where it was supposed to be.

*Merde.* She poked herself over the heart until its beat calmed. *So much for taking a bit of time to let things calm down.*

Fleur caught sight of the Hogsmeade Post Office. \'Tempus,\' she muttered, drifting toward the portkey point through the crowd of students. 'Only a few minutes.

Gabby bounced on the balls of her feet beneath the sign.

Fleur released her Disillusionment Charm. *How on earth did maman manage to get Gabby here early?*

\'Fleur!\' Gabby bounded forward. One of the buttons on the chest of her old blue coat popped free as she seized Fleur in a tight hug.

Fleur laughed. \'Hello, Gabby.\' She stepped back and cupped her

baby sister's cheeks. 'Look at you!'

She beamed and twirled. \'I look like you now.\' Gabby forced the button back through its loop with a broad smile. 'I need a new coat. *Finally.*'

\'You\'ll still be my baby sister,\' Fleur cooed.

Gabby pouted, her eyes flicking down to Fleur's chest. '*Younger* sister. I'm not a little girl anymore.' She giggled, smirked, and pushed down the collar of her coat far enough to reveal the pale corner of an envelope. 'And you should be extra nice to me, now...'

*Merde.* Fleur gulped and glanced toward the post office door. Their mother waited just inside, beneath a shawl and a wide-

brimmed hat.

\'Perhaps I should look after that?\' She stuck her hand out. 'There's not much room inside that coat now.'

Gabby shot her a look of pure innocence. 'It's ok, big sister, I'm going to take great care of it.' A bright spark of mischief welled up in her blue eyes. 'After all, you wrote about so many *interesting* things.'

'Gabby...'

'Nuh uh, Fleur.' Gabby stuck her tongue out and pulled the collar of her coat back up. 'You'd just do something silly if I didn't stop you, like hide away or avoid talking to him.'

'No I wouldn't,' Fleur lied.

'Yes, you definitely would.' Gabby screwed her face up. 'You'd go and hide, then, when you've beaten him in the tournament, you'd come back to France and never write to him. You're silly like that.'

Fleur huffed. 'You worry about your own boy problems, *little*

*chick.*'

Gabby scowled. 'I don't have any *boy* problems. All my friends

have boy problems. They think staring at cute boys, giggling, and chasing

them around is such great fun. It's rubbish.'

Fleur sighed. 'I know, Gabby.'

'But not now!' Gabby beamed. 'Now, I look like you and maman, I'll have all the cute boys staring at me and then all my friends will want to talk to me again.'

*For a little bit.* Fleur mussed her baby's sister's hair and ushered her back toward maman. *Then they'll hate you. But I'll be here, Gabby. And I always will be.*

# Just Keep Swimming

A dim, grey sky stretched over still water and a weak sun hung behind faint clouds. The Forbidden Forest loomed beyond, a thicket of dark pines and shadows, and a low stand ran round the lake shore beside it.

\'Are all the champions here yet, Ludo?\' Mr Crouch strode along the shore. His stark black robes and tight, high, white collar stood out like a vicar at a yard sale.

\'Not yet, Barty.\' Bagman grinned. 'We're one short, but if they're late, then they just lose some of their time.'

\'Well, we aren\'t waiting, then, Ludo.' Mr Crouch clapped his hands. 'Tell these three about the task.\'

\'Right then,\' Bagman boomed. \'Welcome to the second task of the Triwizard Tournament! Naturally, you're all---'

\'Actually, Ludo.\' Mr Crouch stepped in front of Bagman. \'If you don\'t mind, I\'ll explain. Perhaps you can find Professor McGonagall.\'

A glint of anger appeared in Bagman's eyes. 'Of course, Barty.'

Mr Crouch cleared his throat. \'The second task is upon you. I hope you have discovered the secret of your golden egg or you will be woefully unprepared for what is to come.\'

*I'm prepared*. Harry threw a glance at Cedric and Viktor. *I'm going*

*to win.*

\'As the clue states, we have taken from you something that you

will sorely miss, to clarify, we have taken a hostage that you must recover.\'

Cedric stiffened. 'Cho\... You --- you took *Cho*, for a *game.*'

Mr Crouch snapped his fingers at Cedric. \'To alleviate confusion, as some of you may know the hostages of other champions, Ludo will tell you who your hostage is. You are not to interfere with the hostages of the other champions while they are being kept captive, or afterwards.\'

Harry nodded. *Makes sense. Can't have someone killing the other hostages or something to make sure the other champions fail.*

Bagman returned to the fore, accompanied by Professor McGonagall and all three headteachers. 'Still just the one champion left to come...''

Footsteps slapped across the ground and Fleur Delacour skidded to a halt beside Harry. Panic glimmered in her sky blue eyes.

*Good.* Harry stamped down on the stab of pity and the urge to help. *No more playing hero just to feel real. I'm here to win. If she's distracted, she'll be easier to beat.*

\'My apologies.\' Fleur gasped. \'I was unable to find my sister to say goodbye this morning.\'

*Gabby's her hostage.* Harry smothered another stab of pity. *I*

*wonder who they chose for me? I hope it wasn't Ron or Hermione.*

Bagman's grin faded. \'Well, now we're all here, I'll inform you

each who your hostage is.\'

Fleur's eyes darkened and a faint heat washed over Harry's side.

*She's realised now.*

\'Miss Delacour, as you might've gathered, your hostage is your younger sister, Gabrielle Delacour. Mr Diggory, you are searching for your girlfriend, Cho Chang. Mr Krum was originally going to be looking for a friend and quidditch teammate, but he has taken ill and so you will be

going after Hermione Granger instead. Mr Potter---\' Bagman flashed Harry

a grin '---your hostage is the lovely Miss Bell.\'

A laugh burst through Harry's lips.

\'He is being serious, Mr Potter,\' McGonagall snapped. \'Miss Bell was the only one willing to risk herself being your hostage in this task. Without her, you would have been unable to compete and fallen far behind.\'

A little ice crept into Harry's veins. *It wasn\'t like I was going to refuse to save her. Not if she risked herself to help me.*

He turned away and looked out over the dark water lapping at the shore. Algae drifted from the pebbles and the shadows of lake plants floated beyond.

Harry dipped a toe in the water, grimacing at the chill biting into

him. \'This is going to be unpleasant.'

Fleur smiled and Cedric\'s mouth spasmed.

Viktor chuckled and extended his hand to Harry. \'First to get caught by the squid wins, da?\'

\'Or the Grindylows.\' Harry clasped Viktor\'s hand. 'Or whatever else is down there.'

\'On my whistle.\' Mr Crouch pulled a slim, silver thing out of his pocket and put it to his lips.

Harry and the others tugged off their robes, standing about in their swim-wear casting warming charms.

The whistle went.

Fleur pulled a slim veil up over her mouth and nose, tied it, and dove into the lake. Harry watched her silver bikini arc into the water and vanish from sight with a tight knot in his chest. Cedric dropped feet first into the water, his face and neck enclosed within a vibrating bubble.

*No more wasting time.* Harry pictured his transfiguration and cast his magic. His breath failed and he staggered toward the water.

Krum sprinted past him. Gills gaped on the side of his neck, his skin fading to a dull blue-grey.

Harry plunged into the ice-cold water. A great flood of relief washed through him as his lungs filled. *Success.* He cast a sticking charm to fix his glasses on his nose and swam down toward where Salazar remembered the Merpeoples' village to be.

Long light-green weeds rose up from the lake bed, billowing like summer grass in the wind.

*Grindylow habitat.* Harry stayed well above the plants. *Nobody wants to get groped by one of those ugly things.*

The green weeds gave way to thick, black mud as Harry passed by the sunken wreckage of a ship. The giant squid's bulbous form drifted between the two halves of the broken vessel; its tentacles trailed out across the lake bed.

*And I'll give that a wide berth, too.*

A pale silhouette appeared in the distance, drifting in the same direction as Harry, but at a slower pace. He drew his wand as he came alongside the pearl-white figure of a short girl with round, thick-rimmed glasses.

\'Myrtle?\' he burbled.

\'Harry.\' Her voice echoed through the water as if it were air. \'You look better now, much happier, are you searching for the Merpeople, too?\'

He nodded.

\'Cedric was as well, they\'re that way.\' She waved one arm in the direction Salazar had suggested. \'Good luck!\'

Harry smiled and waved, then swam on.

The mud turned to rock. Dark, grey columns loomed up over the lake bed; weed-free monoliths bearing strange, deep-etched symbols.

Faint snatches of the merpeoples' singing reached Harry's ears.

*Half my time is gone.* He kicked harder. *And if the clue's to be believed, Katie's not going anywhere unless I find her before the other half runs out.*

A deafening pop struck him like a hammer. His ears rang and his vision blurred.

Harry shook his head and peered around. Dust rose from the lake bed in great clouds, swirling around the feet of the monoliths. A shimmer rippled away across the lake past his feet.

*Someone else is close by.* Harry clutched his wand and swam forward over the great stone columns. *Someone who just cast quite a powerful spell.*

A pair of figures floated above him, bobbing with the water of the lake as they sank. A horde of battered grindylows scattered away beneath it. Harry caught a glimpse of long, fine, dark hair.

*Cho and Cedric. A grindylow must've somehow punctured the bubble-head charm.* Harry kicked himself closer and found a thick stream of bubbles rising from the shrinking orb of air surrounding Cedric's face. *At*

*least he tweaked the charm enough to stop his skull crumpling when it burst*.

\'Homenum revelio,\' Harry garbled.

Cedric and Cho lit up red. In the distance, Harry glimpsed two more red figures. One far off to his right and the other close in front of him. He wrapped an arm around Cedric and Cho and kicked up, but their weight dragged him down toward the lake bed until his feet grazed the monoliths.

Harry shoved them above him and cast a weak blasting curse. Cho and Cedric shot up through the water toward the surface.

*That'll do it. Someone will fish them out when they break the*

*surface.*

He swam on, glimpsing a cluster of dark, stone huts beyond the

dwindling monoliths.

A crowd of merpeople gathered around the ring of standing stones raised just beyond the edge of their huts. Their copper scales glimmered in the water, translucent webbing joined sharp-clawed fingers and toes into fins, and small, dark eyes tracked his approach.

*Intelligent enough, but not overly friendly.* Harry recalled Salazar's

words with some unease*.*

Twelve black monoliths sat in a ring around a stone altar decorated with pieces of red and white coral and long, thin, sharp-fanged skulls. The furthest three stone pillars bore human figures enshrouded in the faint red glow of Harry\'s fading revealing charm.

He dove down toward the ring of monoliths.

Viktor knifed from between two of the monoliths beneath him, a

shark's head upon his shoulders. Harry froze, drifting above Viktor as he

paused before Hermione and struggled with the knotted kelp binding her to the pillar.

*He's a faster swimmer than I am.* Harry cast an eye at Viktor's muscled torso. *Probably a lot faster. And Fleur's likely somewhere nearby, too.*

He raised his wand. 'Incarcerous,' he burbled.

Thick, black bindings shot from the tip of his wand. They tangled

Viktor's arms and legs.

*Sorry, Viktor.* Harry glanced around him as the merpeople flashed for cover. *But if I hang about here until you've gone, then Fleur will probably turn up and just enthral me. At least I've a chance against you.*

Viktor cut himself free with what looked like a cutting charm and released a handful of jets of water that hissed past Harry. Harry swam behind one of the monoliths as a barrage of spells sailed at him. Viktor abandoned Hermione, swimming upward, his spells flashed through the lake, bursting against the monoliths or drifting off into the distance.

Harry dragged himself round the far side of the monolith and cut the kelp off Katie as Viktor twisted round in the water overhead.

Another barrage of spells hissed down at him. They hammered into the monolith, chipping pieces off its side. Dust clouded the water, pieces of weed and algae floated across Harry's vision.

*Damn.* He kicked upward and out of the dust, casting every single one of the childish, school corridor jinxes he knew.

Viktor tried to throw himself out of the way, but the jelly legs jinx and the dancing jinx struck him on the side and his limbs swayed like tentacles. He raised his wand and they fell still. A steely glint entered his eyes.

A single ray of hot water flashed past Harry's shoulder. The monolith shattered like a dropped glass. The glowing pieces floated down into the lake bed like falling stars.

A slight shiver traced its way down Harry\'s spine. *Perhaps I*

*should've waited and lost to Fleur, at least I might've got another kiss.*

A hail of coloured lights flashed through the water from the tip of

Viktor's wand.

Harry twisted and writhed, casting the shield charm. Washes of coloured light burst on the glow of his ward. He swept his wand at the pebbles underneath Krum\'s position, transfiguring them into a small school of snake-like fish.

Viktor vanished into the shoal and Harry grinned. *Not completely one-sided, at least.*

A giant stone hand seized him round the waist. A shock of adrenaline rippled through Harry's veins. *Transfiguration was his solution, too.*

Harry shattered the arm with a quick blasting curse and banished the pieces at Viktor. He followed them with a handful of jinxes and the disarming charm.

Viktor turned the stones to dust and deflected the curses away with a shield. Several yellow jets of water hissed from his wand.

'Protego,' Harry burbled.

Three burst through his shield, drawing a line of fire through his tricep. Harry clapped a hand to the wound. Red drifted through the water between his fingers.

Viktor stared at him with hard eyes and pointed down at the lake bed with his free hand. A pair of metre deep holes marked the stone beneath Harry's feet. Viktor gestured at the hostages with his left hand, then waggled his wand with his right.

*Fair warning.* Harry's respect for Viktor rose a few notches. *Still, I came to win.* He grinned and raised his wand.

A broad smile spread across Viktor's face and he launched four more yellow curses. They sailed past Harry's waist and shoulder, boring a series of holes into the monolith behind him.

Harry thrust his wand at Viktor. It slipped from his grasp and floated away down toward the lake bed. Viktor gaped, then twisted round and hurled spells off to Harry's right.

*Fleur*. Harry launched himself after his wand. *Time to go. They can duel while I swim back.* He snatched his wand up and kicked round the edge of the pillar. *And I'll win.*

Fleur and Viktor exchanged jets of water. Shield charms flickered between them. Half of Viktor's spells seemed to fade out of existence before even reaching Fleur, whose silver bikini glowed bright as moonlight.

Harry tore his eyes away from Fleur. *They're pretty evenly matched. Let's give them an obstacle to keep them busy while I go.*

Harry summoned the kelp away from Katie, then took a deep breath and transfigured the lake bed beneath them both into towering spines of stone. He grimaced as the cost of the spell sapped the strength from him.

Fleur flinched and shattered the spires beneath her. The backlash threw Viktor and her apart, their spells spraying in all directions. A yellow curse caught her full in the face. Red clouded the water about her trailing silver hair.

*No.* Harry's heart stopped.

Fleur drifted away through the water.

*She's dead.* Ice tightened inside Harry's chest. *She can\'t have survived that spell if it hit her in the face. Can she?*

Fleur twitched and pulled her hair away from her eyes. Her lips were swollen, her chin red and bruised, and a long cut marred her cheek. Her veil hung in tatters around her neck; a small plume of bubbles rose from it.

*And she's still beautiful.* Harry shook his head to clear it of Fleur's

allure. *No. Fool me once, shame on you, but I don't repeat my mistakes.* Fleur clenched her jaw and dove down toward the monoliths. *She's going after her sister.*

Harry and Viktor shared a glance and put their wands away.

Fleur's bubbles ran out. She twisted round and shot Harry a

pleading look, raw emotion shining in her blue eyes.

His heart lurched. Harry struggled against the rising feeling, but his desire to help her flooded over him like dawn's light spilling over the horizon.

*I would've saved her if you'd just asked, Fleur. I would happily have helped the girl who promised she was different.* Harry tried to claw some hate from somewhere, but his need to help her twisted in his chest like a blade. *Her allure's too bloody strong.*

Fleur jabbed her wand upward and ascended out of sight. Viktor disappeared, Hermione cradled underneath him.

Harry dived back down toward the monoliths, grabbing Katie\'s arm and pulling her into his chest.

Gabrielle Delacour bobbed against the final monolith.

He tried to tear himself free from the need to save her, but Fleur's bright blue eyes and the taste of her lips swirled through Harry's thoughts like a hurricane. His heart wrenched.

*I would've saved her anyway.* Harry severed Gabby's bonds. *Fleur*

*didn't even need to ask, let alone do this to me.*

The merpeople shoaled around him. A ball of copper scales and claws that bristled with tridents. Harry narrowed his eyes and raised his wand, pulling the silver-haired girl into his embrace next to Katie.

The nearest of the merpeople jabbed his trident at the girl and

shook its head, raising a single claw. \'Only one,\' it sang. 'Only *one*.'

Harry transfigured their tridents into fish and watched them scatter away. \'You can try and stop me,\' he garbled.

'You will lose,' the merperson sang. 'Would you lose for this little stranger?'

*I would. She doesn't deserve to drown down here.* Harry swallowed a bitter taste and a hot lump of feeling. *But I'm not. Fleur didn't give me a choice. I'm losing for her.*

'We are many.' Another merperson swam from the ball, flexing his claws. 'You are one. You are young. If we wished, we could kill you. Swim away, land-walker.'

Harry wrestled with the memory of Fleur's quiet goodbye. *I can't*

*let them stop me. No matter what I have to do*.

'You could try.' He thrust his wand at them and poured every

drop of his magic into his banishing spell.

A vast ripple flashed from his wand, scattering merpeople across the lake. It tore through the lake bed like a tsunami, shattering the standing circle, altar, and its surrounding monoliths. The stone huts were ripped away like Dudley's toys and dust clouded the water so thick Harry's lungs strained to breath. A slick, copper taste crept up into the back of his throat; pain lanced through his chest.

*Something in my gills is damaged.* Harry breathed a cloud of red and dust out into the water. *Not good.* He glanced at the ragged group of merpeople and lashed Katie and Gabrielle to his back with a quick spell, launching himself in the direction of the shore.

# Cake by the Ocean

Bands of steel gripped her lungs; tightening like a vice. Dark spots hovered in her eyes and the colour drained from the lake as dizziness seized her, swirling round her head like a cloud of summer midges.

*Hold on.* She clung to the image of Gabby's face. *Just a little*

*longer.*

The black spots swelled, covering more and more of the lake. Her

lungs screamed, bursting for air.

*If I breathe, I'll drown. If I breathe, I'll drown.* Fleur fought the reflex with everything she had. *Hold on.*

Sparks of white fluttered in front of her eyes. She took a deep breath. Ice cold water flooded in; it burnt and froze her throat and lungs, as if Fleur had swallowed frozen razors.

*If I can't reach the air, the air must reach me.* She dragged her thoughts into order, picturing the water within her lungs and above her. *Evanesco.*

Her magic was ripped from her as if by some ethereal fist. Sweet, blissful air rushed into her lungs. The dark spots faded.

A ten metre wall of black water closed in on her.

*Merde. I won't make it.* Fleur clung to her wand and took a deep

breath.

The water smashed into her from both sides, spinning her round

like a doll and leaving her dizzy.

Fleur blinked and tried to throw the dizziness off. *Keep swimming up. I was nearly there.* She kicked up toward the dark surface of the water.

A stream of silver bubbles sank down from her nose and lips, past her chin toward the bright depths of the lake.

*Bubbles don\'t sink.* Fleur turned herself around and burst through the surface, gasping lungfuls of air as she floated on her back upon the lake surface. *Gabby\...*

Her stomach and heart twisted all up and around one another, and her eyes grew hot. She struck out toward the shore, pouring the last of her magic into warming charms.

*Please let Harry have saved her. Even if he hates me for enthralling and kissing him.* A hard lump formed in her throat and her eyes prickled with liquid heat. *Fleur Delacour doesn't cry.* Hot tears trickled down her cheeks and dripped into the lake. *S'il te plaît, Harry. S'il te plaît. S'il te plaît.*

She threw herself into swimming, clawing the shore a little closer into view with each stroke. The cold and the ache settled into her bones. Her tears spent themselves into the spray of her swimming.

Fleur dragged herself to the platform, but her strength abandoned her as she tried to pull herself out of the water.

Madam Pomfrey levitated her and bathed her in warming charms.

'Come with me, Miss Delacour.'

Fleur glanced around.

The crowd cheered and shouted in the stand, the judges sat in their box, and the medical tent squatted just beyond the shore, sitting at the end of a trail of water.

'Gabby?' She stumbled after Madam Pomfrey, letting the mediwitch support her with one hand. 'Where is Gabby? My sister? *Where is she?*'

\'Anyone who comes out of the lake will be brought straight to this tent.\' Madam Pomfrey ushered her in with a firm hand. \'You'll see your sister quickest by staying here.\'

*No I won't. I'll see her quickest if I'm near the lake.* Fleur tried to tug herself free.

Madam Pomfrey sighed and pushed her inside with a firm hand. 'I'm sorry, Miss Delacour, but if I let you wait out there in the cold in your state, you may seriously harm yourself. You're in shock as it is.'

'I am not in shock.' Fleur found herself seated on a bed a short way from the door. A faint trickle of heat pooled in her bones. 'I want to see my sister!'

Viktor Krum glanced up from the bed in the back corner. Hundreds of small bite marks covered his torso. Hermione, Harry's former friend, lay asleep in the bed next to him.

Fleur's lip trembled and her tears threatened to return.

Madam Pomfrey traced her wand over Fleur's lips and lower face. 'Just soft tissue damage. Easily fixed.' A gentle heat traced through Fleur's face. 'There. It would've been a real shame to have marked the face of a girl as beautiful as you over a silly game.'

Fleur's lip curled and feathers prickled under her skin. *I'd slice my*

*face up for Gabby without a second thought.*

Madam Pomfrey pushed something thick, sticky, and sweet into Fleur's mouth. 'The warming charms will keep your temperature up until you've got some energy back and your body can do it itself.'

Fleur choked down her mouthful. 'Gabby?'

\'You\'ll feel much better soon. I'm sure your sister's fine.'

Madam Pomfrey strode across the room to Viktor Krum, muttering under her breath, and tapped each of his bite marks until they'd all faded away.

Viktor Krum shifted. 'I am sorry for the curse, da. I get competitive, things got out of hand.'

\'What happened to Gabby and Harry?\' Fleur asked.

Viktor Krum closed his eyes and wrinkled his brow. 'When I left she was still a hostage of those merpeople. Harry may have saved her, he swims slower than me and I had a head start, so he's not yet back.\'

A silver cat bounded in through the entrance flaps and sat up on its haunches, murmuring in the distinctive Scottish accent of the stern transfiguration professor.

Madam Pomfrey swept out of the tent.

\'She must have gone to get Harry.\' Viktor Krum rubbed at his back with his palm. \'I hope he is ok, I owe him revenge for all the bites in the next task.\'

\'The bites?\' Fleur echoed, staring at the flap in the tent.

Her stomach thrashed and flopped around. *Please have saved Gabby, Harry.*

Viktor Krum laughed and nodded his head. \'Da, the fish. He transfigured all the pebbles around me into aggressive fish. They had very sharp teeth. I owe him a curse or two, I think.\'

\'He is only fourteen,\' Fleur murmured.

\'He was holding his own against me for several minutes before you disarmed him and I think he was holding back, every spell he cast was a minor curse or hex. He hit me a couple times, had he used some of the more powerful curses I'm sure he knows, I would still be in the lake.\'

Cedric Diggory blinked and struggled upright. He glanced round, sagging when he caught sight of Cho in the bed beyond him. \'I wonder what our scores will be? Did you guys all make it there and back?\'

\'Yes,\' Viktor Krum said. \'No,\' Fleur whispered.

*Where is Harry? Where is Gabby? Why is the nurse taking so*

*long?*

\'Oh.\' Cedric Diggory's eyes roved over the tent. \'Where\'s Harry?\'

\'The nurse went to get him.\' Viktor Krum pulled his robes back on. Fleur dragged her Beauxbatons uniform from the end of the bed

and struggled into it. All her fingers felt like thumbs, fumbling with the buttons and girdle.

Madam Pomfrey stepped through the flap, white-lipped and tense. Katie Bell lingered behind her.

Fleur's heart crumbled. *Harry left Gabby behind.*

Harry staggered through the flap, snow-pale and trembling.

Gabby slept in his arms, cradled against his chest with a peaceful smile on her lips.

\'You saved her,\' Fleur whispered, blinking back hot tears. 'Merci.'

Harry placed Gabby on the bed next to his and accepted the proffered Pepper-Up potion from Madam Pomfrey with resigned, wry smile.

\'I do not expect, Mr Potter,\' Madam Pomfrey said, \'to see such a dangerous use of self-transfiguration in all the rest of my life. You turned your lungs into some horrible parody of gills, restructured the entire musculature of your chest, and thought it would have no consequences.\'

Harry nodded and rolled his eyes, turning away and pressing a hand to his mouth. A raw, rough cough tore from his throat. Fleur glimpsed a spatter of crimson upon his palm before Madam Pomfrey sat him down.

\'You've put far too much strain on your lungs,\' she muttered, running her wand over his exposed chest. \'Professor Dumbledore told me you decided to pick a fight with a whole tribe of merpeople and razed almost a sixth of the lake bed. No doubt all the dust you breathed in as well as the pressure of your magic damaged your transfigured lungs. I\'ve fixed you as best I can, but some of the damage has come back with the reversion. You\'ll likely have that cough for a short while. Maybe it will remind you that we can\'t just put you back together every time you try something so reckless.\'

Harry looked like he wanted to object, but bent over to cough into his hand. Another deep, wet, sound tore from his throat and red flecks dotted his palm.

Fleur winced. *The only reason the merpeople would interfere is if they were upholding the rules.* She glanced at her sleeping sister. *Which means he did that for me.* She twisted away and dried the corners of her eyes.

'Is my sister okay?' she murmured.

Madam Pomfrey bustled over to Katie and Gabby and ran her

wand over the pair. 'They're both perfectly fine.'

Fleur stumbled from her bed and collapsed down next to Harry.

'Merci, Harry.\' She wrapped her arms around him. 'Vraiment. Merci.'

Harry stiffened and edged out of her embrace.

Fleur winced and drew back. 'Merde, pardon. Je---' Her words died

on her tongue.

Harry's eyes turned cold and hard as ice. \'It\'s okay, Fleur.\' He flashed her a horrible, bright smile. 'I'm sure *any* boy in my place would've ended up doing the exact same.'

Fleur recoiled, stung. *What?*

Satisfaction flickered through Harry's cold eyes.

*He's glad he hurt me.* Fleur\'s heart twisted and her eyes filled with hot, angry tears. *I don't understand.*

Viktor Krum peered through the flap. \'The scores are being

announced.'

A small, bitter smile crept onto Harry's lips. 'Shall we go see what

I got, Fleur?' He swept out of the tent.

*Does he blame me for coming last?* A strange lightness swirled round Fleur's head. *Why's he so angry? Even if he thinks I enthralled him, I only kissed him.* Her eyes slid to Gabby and then to Katie Bell. Heat bubbled beneath her skin, feathers prickled down her back, and along her limbs. *You did something, didn't you? After the Yule Ball, when I tried to avoid things, you went after him and turned him against me. You must have.*

'Come on, Fleur?' Harry's voice drifted from just outside, his tone

light and cold as frost. 'Don't you want to see our scores?'

*And now it's too late. He hates me.* Tears slipped through Fleur's lashes and her anger evaporated. *Fine. Just me, then. As always. Fleur Delacour doesn't cry.* She smeared her tears away and drew herself up.

'Of course.' Fleur stepped out of the tent. 'We will see who won, shall we?'

\'I got forty.\' Cedric Diggory grinned. \'After my Bubble-Head charm exploded, I feared I would do the worst again.\'

\'You were there first?\' Viktor Krum asked. \'I didn't see you.\'

Cedric Diggory nodded. \'I went for speed, but my adaptation to the bubble-head charm failed; it still exploded when a grindylow pierced it.'

box.

Harry stared off into the distance somewhere beyond the judges'

Viktor Krum rubbed his palms together. 'Da, I see. You lost points

because you didn't return to the finish, but did better than the rest of us

elsewhere.\'

Behind the two of them the judges were conjuring a new set of numbers, hers. Fleur tallied the count as they went.

\'Thirty six.'

*It's not terrible, considering I didn't even manage to get Gabby*

*back.*

\'For an innovative and exceptional piece of transfiguration,\' Ludo

Bagman boomed, \'and for being one of only two champions to return with their hostage, we award Mr Potter forty points.\'

A murmur of surprise came from the spectators. A tremor passed across Harry\'s face as he stared at where Barty Crouch conjured the number four from his wand. Harry's green eyes brimmed with fury.

\'Had Mr Potter not interfered with the hostage of another champion I would have no reason to remove points,\' Mr Crouch declared. 'As it is, he disobeyed the rules, and must pay the penalty.'

Fleur's heart sank a little lower. *No wonder Katie managed to turn him against me. Every time he helps me, he gets set back.*

\'The winner of the second task and new highest scoring champion is Viktor Krum, whose brilliant piece of transfiguration and swift return with his hostage grant him a score of forty four.\' Ludo Bagman thrust his wand back into his robes and twisted round to argue with Mr Crouch.

Viktor Krum grinned. 'Now I am winning, da?'

\'Eighty six.\' Cedric Diggory pointed at Krum, then at Harry, Fleur, and himself. \'Eighty two. Eighty. Seventy four. We're all close enough for the last task to decide everything.\'

\'Yes.\' Viktor Krum nodded and shot Harry a vicious grin. \'I owe you for those fish. They had nasty teeth.\'

Harry chuckled, but his eyes didn't thaw and his gaze remained fixed on the argument between Mr Crouch and Ludo Bagman. \'I\'m much better above water.' His eyes flicked back to meet Fleur's. 'And I really *really* want to win now.'

*I wish I'd never kissed him.* Fleur swallowed a barbed thicket of feeling. *Liar. You just wish you'd not made a mess of it.* She took a deep breath. *It can be fixed. Everything can be fixed. It just won't be easy.*

\'You can still win.\' Maman came round from the side of the tent. \'Four points is nothing. There'll be ample opportunity to outdo them in the next task. You did well, Fleur, especially in such an adverse environment.\'

\'If it'd been real, Gabby would be gone,\' Fleur muttered.

*Why did Harry even save her, if Katie Bell's made him hate me so*

*much?*

\'Gabby was never in danger. When they asked us who you'd be

most determined to save, your sister volunteered. We were assured that she would be in no danger.\'

'Good.' Fleur dragged her pride up onto her face. 'I'll still win.'

Harry swivelled on his heel and strode back toward the castle. Katie Bell burst from the tent and scampered after him. Fleur watched her chase after him with ashes in her mouth. *I've not lost yet.* She forced down the heat that pooled in her bones and smothered the feathers sliding through her skin. *I don't lose to petty, shallow, lying little girls. Not anymore.*

Gabby darted from the tent. 'Fleur!'

A smile crept onto her lips. 'Gabby. I'm sorry I couldn't save you.'

Gabby shook her head from side to side. 'Nuh uh. It's better this way. You'll see.'

*Oh Gabby. This isn't one of maman's stories.*

Fleur stifled a sigh. 'Come on, little chick. Let's go find some hot chocolate and something sweet.'

Gabby beamed. 'Maman?'

'You two go. I need to speak with Madame Maxime.'

fancy?'

Fleur let Gabby lead her away toward the carriage. 'What do you

'Cherries.' Gabby pouted. 'I *know* you have some.' 'Because you turned over my entire room searching?'

Gabby giggled, a glint of mischief hovering in her eyes. 'And I bet

they're not the only *cherry* you're thinking of giving away, huh, big sister?'

Fleur choked. 'Don't let maman hear you talking like that. Where did you even pick that up?'

'Maman.' Gabby laughed. 'Her romance stories have all sorts of steamy bits in as well.' The mischievous glimmer welled back up in her blue eyes. 'So, Fleur? Did you talk to him?'

Fleur sighed. 'He hates me. And that is all I'm going to say.' Gabby's brow wrinkled. 'Then he must not know you very well.

You need to talk to him more, otherwise he won't be able to realise he's

wrong.'

Fleur pinched the bridge of her nose. 'Gabby, I love you dearly, but if you don't leave this be, I'm going to hex you until you can't sit down.'

Gabby giggled. 'No you won't,' she sang. 'Because then I'll go

steal Harry for myself. He did *save* me.'

*And he's not happy about it. I bet Katie Bell keeps slandering me*

*every chance she gets.*

'If you want to help, you can take my mind off it by not talking about it,' Fleur said.

She pouted. 'Fine. You owe me cherries, though.'

# Neville's Crucible

Harry watched the staircase swing back toward him from between a clump of first years. They threw him nervous glances out of the corner of their eyes and whispered his name in hushed tones.

*Idiots.* He rolled his eyes and stepped onto the moving stair.

'Got you.\' Katie wriggled around the back of the firsties and

jumped onto the moving stair with him.

Harry glanced over the side at the several floor drop. \'I suppose you have. Bit of a risky move, that.\'

\'I --- er --- I have a lot of things to say.' Her smile wilted. 'I probably won\'t be able to say all of it before the stairs swing back...'

*I suppose I can't keep avoiding this forever.*

He gave Katie a faint smile. \'I guess I\'ll have to wait, then.\' \'Thank you,\' Katie murmured. She tugged at her little finger,

twisting the skin round her knuckle until it went white. \'I guess I should start with the tournament. Professor McGonagall came and asked me if I could be your hostage. She said that the hostage was someone that you\'d be most determined to save, someone you\'d sorely miss. I, well, you\'re still important to me, Harry.\'

'I *did* save you. I admit that I considered leaving you to be a mermaid, but there's no quidditch underwater. I was afraid you'd never forgive me.'

'I would *never* have forgiven you,' Katie declared. A brief smile passed across her lips. 'I would have made a great mermaid, though. I've got the right hips for it. Just need a seashell bra.'

Harry's eyes dropped from Katie's face. 'Well, you don't *need* a seashell bra.' He raised an eyebrow at her. 'I'm sure nobody would complain if you went without.'

Katie laughed. 'I *bet* they wouldn't.'

The stairs came to a halt and Harry stepped onto the lower set. Katie stared at him, a small frown marring her brows. He reached out and pulled her down onto the step next to him before they swung away.

\'Let\'s go wander toward the quidditch pitch,\' Harry said. 'We can talk out there without anyone listening in.'

Katie squirmed, but nodded.

They drifted through the corridors and stepped out into the spring cool, picking their way across the grass and dodging the protruding tips of the spring flowers.

Harry took a seat in the stands. 'Go on, then. You first. You've been

chasing me, after all.'

Katie shuffled her feet and fiddled with her little finger. \'Can we be friends again? Will you forgive me, for going with Roger Davies and being so stupid.\'

*If you forget your mistakes, you just end up repeating them.* Harry took a deep breath. *That doesn't mean we can't be friends, though. I just need to remember.*

\'No, I won\'t forgive you for overreacting. Davies just wanted to revenge himself on me for getting Fleur Delacour\'s attention when he could not, and she---\' Harry clenched his jaw and buried the memory of her blue eyes less than a finger's length from his face '---she just wanted to *win*.\'

\'But we\'ll be friends?\' Something in Katie's manner faltered.

Harry saw in the reflection of her eyes how cold his face had become. \'Definitely. You proved that you still cared when you nearly became a mermaid. I just wanted to be clear... in case you were about to ask me to Hogsmeade again.'

Katie fidgeted. \'You looked very lonely. I wanted to go and speak with you, but Angelina and Alicia thought it was a bad idea.\'

\'They were probably right,\' Harry admitted. \'If you hadn\'t agreed to help me with the task I might not've believed you. I -- I find it very hard to trust people twice.\'

\'I'm not surprised,\' Katie whispered. 'But I won't let you down again, Harry. I promise, yeah. Not again. And it's ok you don't want to date me, too. I'm not mad, or anything. We kind of messed that up.'

'Yeah. We did.' Harry sighed. 'A shame, really. It was really good until it wasn't.'

Katie nodded. 'Yeah.' A little spark rose in her eyes. 'But I meant what I said, Harry. I won't let you down. I won't do anything stupid like that again. I won't choose anything over our friendship.'

\'You will,\' Harry murmured. 'But I expect some things to be chosen above me now, everyone has goals, dreams, and people more dear to them than others. As long as I know where I stand on your scale and think it\'s fair, then I\'ll never be disappointed or hurt. I've got my own scale now, too, so it's all even.\'

A small smile curved Katie's lips, then she beamed and leapt up.

'Want to see what I look like when I'm not wearing a seashell bra?' Harry flushed. 'Er?'

'I look like this, silly!' Katie cackled. 'What, did you think I was about to pull my top up and flash you? We're not even *dating*, Harry. A boy's got to ask me out before anything like that happens.'

He snorted and cast a quick tempus. 'Okay. You got me. I have to go help Nev, Katie. I'll catch you later.'

\'Be gentle with him,' Katie murmured. 'He seems fragile now. I heard when he met Mr Crouch in the hallways, he accidentally set fire to every tapestry within ten feet of him.\'

\'Nev?\' Harry studied her expression, but there was no mischief in her eyes. \'He did violent, accidental magic at *our* age?\'

*What on earth could've pushed him so far?* Harry frowned when nothing sprang to mind. *I really don't know anything about Nev at all, do I?*

\'I heard it from Alicia, who said she heard Malfoy and Ron arguing over it,\' Katie said. \'Apparently, Malfoy was going on about how he heard Neville couldn\'t even perform accidental magic as a child. There\'s some story about Neville\'s family trying to provoke him into doing some when he was a baby and Malfoy was bandying it about. Ron had to be dragged away by Seamus and Dean.\'

\'When was this?\' Harry demanded.

\'A few days ago. I can\'t believe you didn\'t hear about it. The whole

school's talking about it.\'

\'I've kind of stopped listening to rumours. It makes my life easier.' Harry sighed. 'How's Nev been?\'

\'I haven\'t really seen him,\' Katie said. \'You know how he is with girls. He stutters twice as much even talking to Hermione and I'm fairly sure Hermione's about as asexual as the venomous tentacula. Ron

defended him, but it was more because he hates Malfoy than anything to do with Neville.\'

\'I can\'t imagine Nev doing something like that.'

\'It\'s true. I\'ve seen the walls on the fourth floor where the

tapestries used to be.'

'I should go meet him.' Harry stood up.

\'When will I next be able to corner you?\' Katie asked.

Harry grinned. 'I\'ll be around. I'm sure you know where I turn up

after stalking me for so long.\'

She beamed. \'You can\'t hide from me, Harry!'

'I definitely can.' He cast his disillusionment spell and faded from

view.

\'That explains a lot!\' Katie yelled after him.

Harry hurried back up to the seventh floor. Nev leant against the

tapestry opposite the Room of Requirement.

*There\'s an item of furnishing Hogwarts won\'t miss if he feels like setting fire to something else.*

\'We\'re using the room?\' Nev nodded at the blank wall across from

him.

\'Yes.'

\'I found it over the last year,\' Nev said. \'I often come to wander the

school away from anyone and not many people come up here. One time, I just wanted somewhere to be one my own and the room appeared. How did you find it?\'

\'I knew it was here,\' Harry said. \'I came looking for it and eventually I found it.\'

\'S-Shall we go in.\'

\'After you...\' Harry smiled. \'Since you know how to use it and what

you need better than I do.\'

*What you need is what I needed.*

The door grew into place on the stonework. Harry followed Nev inside. Empty stone stretched from floor to ceiling.

Nev hung his head. 'I guess I don\'t really know what I want.\'

Harry grimaced. *Which means I'm the one with the strongest desire and the room's about to change. Fantastic.*

\'Let\'s try again.\' He ushered Nev out the door and slammed it shut, sparing only a single glance for the holly log fire.

*And that's just the beginning of that room's lack of respect for*

*personal privacy.*

Nev stared at his feet. \'Y-you\'re disappointed in me n-now, aren\'t

you?\'

\'No.'

\'You\'re just saying that,\' he mumbled. \'Everyone knows I\'m not

much of a wizard.\'

*You need to believe in yourself, Nev. If you expect to fail, it'll*

*corrupt your intent.*

\'Would not much of a wizard be able to set an entire corridor alight without using his wand?\' Harry asked.

Guilt flashed across Nev's face.

\'I don\'t think they could,\' Harry said. \'You even rid the school of some terrible tapestries.\' He grinned and jabbed his thumb at the tap- dancing trolls. \'If you\'d got that one, you'd have your own award for special services to the school!\'

Nev smiled.

\'You\'re strong. You just need to stop listening to the people who try to tell you otherwise. If you expect and visualise your spells failing, they will.\'

\'I\'m not like you, Harry,\' Neville burst out. \'I can\'t just *be strong*. I can\'t stand up to You-Know-Who, or basilisks, or anything like you\'ve done.\'

\'You\'re just like me, Nev,\' Harry said. 'You've just not been stuck in a spot where you've had no choice but to ignore that little voice of doubt in the back of your head.\'

\'What if I can\'t do it?\'

\'How would you know until you\'ve tried as hard as you\'re sure you can?\' Harry asked.

\'I---'

\'You don\'t,\' Harry said. \'There\'s nothing to be gained from giving up, Neville. You\'re stronger and braver than half of the Gryffindors I\'ve seen, and to prove it you\'re going to call Voldemort by his real name.\'

\'I can\'t do that.\' Nev shook his head. \'Even Gran doesn\'t say his

name.\'

\'You will,\' Harry said. \'Repeat after me. Tom. Marvolo. Riddle.\'

Nev's brow creased. \'Tom Marvolo Riddle.\'

\'See. You, Neville Longbottom, just said Voldemort\'s *real*, original name. One he hates, one he'd probably try and kill you for saying if he knew. What happened when you said it, Nev?\'

\'Nothing,\' the boy mumbled.

\'And nothing will happen next time you say it, or if you say

Voldemort,\' Harry said. 'Go on.\'

\'V-Voldemort,\' Nev muttered.

Harry shot him a grin. \'You\'re braver than your Gran. And I've heard she's a pretty formidable lady.\'

\'But--'

\'There *are* no buts, Nev. You said the name, you were brave. If you can be brave when you thought you couldn\'t be, then you can be strong, too.\'

\'But my magic always fails,\' he said. \'I know it will.\'

\'You knew that you couldn\'t say Voldemort a moment ago,\' Harry murmured. \'Forget what happened last time. Magic's about intent. If you want it to happen, if you focus and understand what you\'re trying to achieve, then you\'ll make it happen.\'

\'I always want it to happen,\' Neville said. \'I\'d bet you never believe it will, though.\' Nev shuffled his feet. 'Maybe.'

'Believe it, Nev.\' Harry put a hand on his shoulder. \'If you can set fire to a corridor without a wand, you've more than enough power to do a few spells.\'

\'It\'s not the same,' Nev whispered. \'I was so angry when I saw him. It was like he thought he was better than the rest of us, striding down the corridor with his tight collar and self-righteous face. Nothing but disdain for everyone else. He judges everyone he sees like it's his *right*.\' Neville\'s face twisted. \'He's *no* right to, not when his own *son* was a monster!\'

*His son's dead.* Harry remembered the ash basilisk and the shattered torso of the mad Death Eater. *And if he thought following rules was more important than a little girl's life, it's no wonder his son turned out such a mess.*

\'His son is dead, isn\'t he?\' Harry asked.

\'Not dead enough,\' Neville hissed. \'Not after what he did.\' Nev took a deep breath. \'My parents were aurors in the war. A group of V- Voldemort\'s followers tortured them with the Cruciatus Curse for hours. They don\'t even recognise me.' A bitter smile crept onto Nev's lips. 'I wanted to make them proud, I even use my father\'s wand, but they\'ll never be proud of some stranger. Why would they?\'

*Poor Nev. That might be worse than having no parents at all. It's easy to pretend dead people would've loved you.*

\'What can I do about that, Harry?\' Nev demanded. \'Nothing,\' Harry replied.

Nev flinched.

\'Just like there\'s nothing *I* can do to bring my parents back. You should be strong for yourself, your own reasons, and your own goals. I\'d be

proud of you for that and I\'m sure your parents would be proud of you as well. Your gran, too. And if they aren\'t, then they should be.\'

\'They\'d be so disappointed if they could recognise me now,\' Neville mumbled. \'Sometimes, I\'m glad they can\'t, just so they don\'t have to be let down by me like Gran is. I\'ll never be as good as either of them.\'

*You need more proof, do you, Nev?*

\'You won\'t be as good as them if you give up,\' Harry said. \'But if you believe in yourself, why can\'t you be better? You have all the tools you need. You can't deny you have enough magical power, you set a corridor on fire without using a wand. You just need to want it.\'

'Maybe I don't want it anymore,' Nev muttered. 'Maybe I've

already given up.'

*Well, we'll see about that.* Harry drew himself up. *Let's give you*

*some proof, Nev. You trust me, I ought to try and trust you.*

\'I want you to open that door, Nev.' Harry pointed at the empty wall. 'The room will change for the one who wants things most if those using it aren't in unison. You don't doubt how much I want things, do you?'

Nev shook his head. 'No. No, you've grown so strong.'

'Then if the room changes and you want something even more than me, you'll be able to get strong, too.'

Nev wrestled with it. 'I guess so.'

'You know so.' Harry willed the room back into existence and twisted the handle. 'So let's see.'

*Nev isn\'t the only one who needs to be brave.*

A hundred different reflections of Fleur Delacour looked down at him. Her rare, warm smile and bright blue eyes shone from dozens of frames. They leant forward, a memory away from kissing him.

\'Harry?\' Nev's eyes flickered over the walls.

Harry gestured round the room. 'The room's shown you what I want, as much as I'd rather it wouldn't.' He pulled as much of a smile onto his face as he could manage. 'Now show me how much you want to be strong.\'

Fleur Delacour's silver hair and blue eyes faded from the walls of

the room to be replaced by shelves of spell books.

*A stupid thing to want.* Harry watched the pictures go with a bitter, sour heat in his heart. *She just wants to win. She's proven that twice now. Better to want to help Nev. He can be trusted not to thrall me, at least.*

\'Well done, Nev,\' he said.

Nev gaped at the walls. 'I did it. I --- I actually *did it.*'

*No, you didn't.* Harry flashed Nev a bright smile. *I changed the room. I wanted to help you help yourself. But as long as you believe in this, then you'll believe in yourself.*

'Let's have a test,\' Harry suggested. \'The blasting curse has the incantation *reducto*.\' He demonstrated the wand motion with his hand and conjured a statue of Mr Crouch. \'Destroy it.\'

Neville\'s eyes burnt. \'Reducto,\' he spat, sweeping his wand into a sharp vee. The spell hissed across the room and blew the upper half of the statue into dust.

\'Not bad for a first try. You need to practise the wand motion a bit, it was over exaggerated, but still a good first try. Better than mine, actually.\'

\'Reducto,\' Neville cried.

The remaining half of the statue exploded into shining grey dust.

\'Well done,\' Harry said. 'When you've a better grasp of the spell,

you\'ll be able to control the power put into it and cast it silently.\'

He drew two sharp, horizontal fees in the air with his wand, unleashing two silent blasting curses at one of the empty walls. The first sparked out, but the second rippled across the wall and a wave of hot air reflected back past them.

\'I should practice,\' Nev said.

\'Practice everything you think you need to, but don\'t forget how successful you were here when you\'re doing it on your own.\'

\'I won\'t.\' Neville stared at the dust that had once been the statue of Barty Crouch Senior. \'I only wish that I could've shown Barty Crouch he wasn\'t anything more than the father of a monster. He\'s disappeared. I heard Professor Sprout talking to Professor McGonagall about it this morning by the greenhouses.\'

\'Has he,\' Harry murmured, a small smile spreading over his lips. \'What a terrible shame.\'

# If You Go Out in the Woods Today

A warm finger prodded her in the cheek. Fleur turned onto her side and pulled the covers over her head.

\'Wake up, Fleur!\'

*Gabby.*

Fleur rolled over and cracked open an eye. \'You know I hate it when you do this. How did you even get in here?\'

Gabby bounced on the balls of her feet and giggled. \'The carriage

lets in all Beauxbatons students.'

\'My room doesn't.\' Fleur pulled her wand out, but found her wards intact. 'And you didn't take them apart. You've not been able to do that for a while.'

\'You warded it?\' Gabby eyed the doorframe. 'Oh. I can feel it now. I thought you'd forgotten or let me in.'

\'It's like my room at Beauxbatons,\' Fleur said.

\'Well, I\'m almost like you now, Fleur.\' Gabby poked her in the side. \'I just walked in and nothing happened.\'

Fleur considered that. *I suppose, given we're sisters, pretty similar, and both veela, we might be able to pass for one another now Gabby's growing up. It means my ward isn't as good as I thought, though, if it can be fooled like that.*

\'I shall have to lock you out again.\' Fleur threw back the covers and moved in search of her uniform.

Gabby's face fell.

Fleur traced her sister's gaze to her breasts. \'It takes time. They don't grow *overnight*, Gabby.'

\'But it\'s already been so long.\' Gabby pouted and clapped her hands to her chest. \'I want to be like you, Fleur. You\'re so much prettier than me. It\'s not *fair*.\'

\'You\'ll be just as beautiful as me, Gabby.' Fleur rummaged through her drawers for a clean bra. \'And then you\'ll come to realise it\'s not as good as it seems.\' She cupped her breasts. 'Boys see these and forget about everything else. Girls see that and get all riled up.'

\'Only people who are already pretty don\'t care about being pretty.\' Gabby sulked, then her eyes lit up with mischief. \'I bet Harry wouldn\'t be so fond of you if you weren\'t pretty.\'

\'Harry doesn\'t seem very fond of me anyway,' Fleur said. \'He\'s not

important.\'

Gabby giggled. \'Nuh uh, Fleur.\' She wagged her finger. \'I know you better than that. And even if I didn\'t, I still have a letter you sent me that says otherwise.\'

'No, you don\'t.\'

Gabby frowned and patted down her pockets.

\'I stole it back.\' Fleur smirked and tucked her wand into her waistband.

\'Oh.\' Gabby pouted. \'I was going to have so much fun showing that to maman and papa, and then...\' Her eyes gleamed with silent laughter. \'I was going to show it to *Harry* .\'

\'And that, Gabby, is why I took it back.\' Fleur sighed. \'I love you, little chick, but sometimes you\'re just too much trouble.\'

\'Spoilsport.' Gabby's eyes roved round Fleur's room.

\'You won\'t find it. It\'s gone.\'

\'You destroyed it?\' Gabby gasped. \'But if the letter is gone, how is Harry going to know you love him and come to find you?\'

Fleur laughed. \'Yes, I burnt it. I think you\'ve been reading too many books from maman\'s romance collection again, Gabby. That isn\'t how things work.\'

\'They\'re good books. You changed your mind about him, then?\' \'I am not chasing after someone who hates me,\' Fleur declared.

\'Even in maman\'s books, it's the wizard who runs after the witch.\'

\'So you don\'t want him?\' Gabby beamed. \'Can I have him instead?

He\'s my age, that\'s too young for you anyway.\'

\'No,\' Fleur snapped. \'You haven\'t even met him, Gabby.\'

\'He saved me from the lake.\' She sighed, pressed a hand to her

heart, and collapsed on Fleur\'s bed. 'Like a true hero.\'

Fleur snorted. \'You know you weren\'t in any danger.\'

\'He didn\'t. And he still saved me, so either he\'s a hero, or...\' She looked up at Fleur from under her lashes. \'Or he had some other reason for saving your darling, baby sister.\'

*He saved you because that was the right thing to do.* Fleur's heart twisted and tore. *But he didn't do it for me. He can't have, not when he hates me.*

\'Enough, Gabby.\' Fleur levelled a stern stare at her sister.

'*Enough.*'

Gabby pouted. \'Do you think you\'re going to win?\'

\'I\'m going to win.\' Fleur smiled. 'As always, remember? Where\'s maman? There\'s no way she would have let her little chick wander off on her own and you aren\'t sneaky enough to get away yet.\'

\'You don\'t win when we play cards, I\'m luckier than you.\' Gabby grinned. \'Maman is speaking with Madame Maxime again. She has to go back to Carcassonne soon, but I\'m almost as far ahead of everyone in my year as you were and I want to stay to watch.\'

\'All the way to the end?\' A gentle warmth flooded through Fleur's heart. 'Really?'

\'All the way until the third task. It\'s not so much fun at the chateaux without you and I know you must miss me.\' Gabby fluttered her eyelashes and kicked her feet against Fleur\'s pillow. 'Non?'

*Lonely, huh, Gabby.* Fleur mussed her sister's hair. *Me too, little*

*chick.*

them.\'

\'I hope Madame Maxime lets you stay,\' she said.

\'She will. I got the highest marks in my classes since you took

\'Still trying to beat me.' Fleur stuck her nose in the air. 'Nobody

beats me, baby sister. Not even you.'

\'I\'ll beat you next year in the real exams,\' Gabby declared.

*In some of them, I expect you will.* Fleur messed her sister's hair up again. *You've got softer magic than I do. If you pick the right sort of enchantment, it ought to be better than mine.*

\'Let\'s go somewhere?\' Gabby pleaded. \'Your room is boring without all the little things you made.\'

\'I can make you something if you want?\' Fleur offered. \'It\'s probably best to stay around here so maman knows where you are and doesn\'t have to worry about you getting into trouble.\'

\'I never get into trouble. And maman won\'t worry about me when I\'m with you.\' She looked up at Fleur, all big blue eyes, white teeth, and silver hair.

*If I didn't know better, I'd accuse her of using her allure on me. She*

*could draw tears from a stone with that look.*

\'Fine...\' Fleur caved. \'Where would you like to go?\'

\'Somewhere exciting,\' Gabby cried.

\'I can show you where they kept the dragons from the first task?\'

*Even Gabby can't cause trouble there. It's not far into the forest,*

*either, so nothing dangerous should be around.*

\'Let\'s go.\' Gabby jumped off the bed and smirked. \'We can sneak

out.\'

\'We can just ask...'

\'Sneaking is more fun. Look what I can do?\' Gabby pulled her

wand out of her cleavage. 'See?'

Fleur spluttered. \'You keep your wand *there?*\'

Gabby beamed. \'I couldn\'t before, but I can now, and it\'s much less likely to be lost or stolen when it\'s safely tucked away here.\'

\'You can\'t draw it very quickly,\' Fleur chided. \'The best place to keep it is at your waist or up your sleeve.\'

\'Fine,\' Gabby grumbled, \'but we\'re still sneaking.\' \'We can sneak, but you *always* get caught.\'

\'Not anymore. Watch.\'

Gabby twirled her wand in a familiar fashion and faded from view.

*As good as mine, or very close.* Fleur studied the slight shimmer.

*Never quite perfect, though. Our natural magic fights the intent of the charm.*

\'Tell me you\'ve seen anyone my age with a better disillusionment charm,\' Gabby crowed.

\'It\'s very impressive,\' Fleur said.

*But Harry's is perfect.*

\'Let\'s sneak.\' Gabby giggled, opened Fleur\'s door, and tip-toed

out.

Fleur cast her own charm and followed her sister's footsteps

across the carpeted hall, then out of the carriage into the grass.

\'Which way?\' Gabby chirped, dispelling her disillusionment charm. Fleur did the same, pointing her wand in the direction of

Hogwarts\' quidditch pitch. Gabby took off, scampering across the wet

grass without a care for her clothes.

\'Slow down, Gabby,\' Fleur called after her. \'If you get lost in the woods we won\'t ever find you again. You don't want to be stuck here, the weather is *terrible.*\'

Gabby bounded ahead to the pitch edge and into the trees, pausing every now and again to make sure Fleur hadn't been left behind. Fleur had to hurry to keep track of her bright hair through the trees in front of her.

\'Gabby,\' Fleur called, when her sister managed to lose her among the trees. \'Come back.\'

Silence hung beneath the pines. Fleur\'s heart began to beat a little faster. Apprehension curled in her stomach.

A shrill scream tore through the trees.

Fleur snatched her wand out and sprinted through the branches towards the sound. Sharp-needled boughs whipped across her face as she ran, despite her shielding arm, but Fleur ignored the stinging. She rounded a tree and hit something soft, bouncing off and rolling across the floor.

\'Fleur,\' Gabby groaned. 'Why did you hit me?'

\'Why did you scream?\' Fleur demanded, pulling herself up on a nearby tree, keeping her wand levelled.

\'Look!\' A note of horrified fascination crept into Gabby's voice.

Fleur twisted away from the tree, and brushed her hair out of her eyes. She followed Gabby's line of sight. Blackened bones, charred and twisted by fire, covered by strips of melted, scorched flesh lay crumpled beneath the trunk of a pine.

*A skeleton.* Fleur's blood chilled. *And you don't set fire to a body unless you've a very good reason not to want people to find it.*

\'Stay away from it, Gabby,\' Fleur murmured. \'Actually, go get Madame Maxime, she\'ll know what to do.\'

Gabby hurried off, running back in the direction they had come.

Fleur edged a bit closer and studied the skeleton. Shattered and cracked bones slumped beneath the branches of the tree, loose teeth gleamed amongst the scattered, dead needles, and only a few strips of charred flesh dangled from the dented skull.

*Burnt*. *And I found the body.* Chill fingers groped their way down Fleur's spine. *Rita Skeeter will have a field day with this. Part veela witch seduces and murders British wizard. At least it's been here too long to be Mr Crouch.*

\'Fleur!\' Maman\'s voice cut through the trees. \'What\'s going on?

Gabrielle was rambling about skeletons.\'

Madame Maxime stomped into the small clearing and gasped. \'Expecto patronum,\' she whispered. A huge, silver swan burst from the tip of her wand. \'Go to Dumbledore, tell him we have discovered a body in the forest, but we don't know who it is.\'

The swan of silver mist shimmered and soared off towards the

castle.

\'How did you find this?\' Madame Maxime asked.

\'Gabby wanted to go somewhere, so I offered to take her to where

the dragons were,\' Fleur said.

\'You shouldn\'t have given in, Fleur.' Maman folded her arms. \'You

always do whatever Gabrielle asks without considering the consequences.\'

\'It is a good thing she did,\' Madame Maxime said. \'This is not Barty Crouch the Triwizard Judge, the skeleton is the wrong height. Yet they haven't been dead for more than a few months.\'

A bright, flame-edged red flash burst through the branches and Albus Dumbledore stepped into the clearing. His phoenix perched upon his

shoulder; its quiet soft song lifted Fleur's heart and banished thoughts of

Rita Skeeter.

\'That is not Barty Crouch,\' Dumbledore said. \'I have a few questions, Miss Delacour, then it would be best if you returned to the carriage and remained somewhere the aurors can find you in case they require answers of their own.\'

Fleur nodded.

\'You cannot be suggesting they will suspect her?!\' Maman drew

herself up. 'If anyone accuses *my* daughters---'

\'I am implying nothing of the sort, Madam Delacour, but they may have questions about the body that your daughters can answer.\' Albus Dumbledore drew his wand, a knotted, engraved length of pale wood, and cast some powerful wards in a tight circle around the body. \'Did you only just find this skeleton, Miss Delacour?\'

\'Yes. Gabby screamed and I came running after her and found it.\' \'Have either of you touched the body?\'

\'No.\' Gabby's whisper came from right behind Fleur. Fleur flinched. \'Who is it?\'

\'I don\'t know,\' Dumbledore said. \'But we will find out. I can assure you that it is not a student, the wards of the school would have notified me the moment one of them left the grounds without permission and I know for fact they are still working as of just before the wand-weighing ceremony.\'

\'That was some time ago, Albus,\' Madame Maxime said.

\'It tells me that they've not decayed over time enough to fail and

nobody has tampered with them in over a decade, which I would've

certainly noticed. Whoever this poor unfortunate is, he is neither staff nor student.\' The old wizard tucked his strange wand away to run his fingers through his beard. \'That does rather lead to the question of what he was doing here. Alastor has been growing increasingly concerned of late, but I had no evidence to lend credence to his theories but the shadows in his foe glass.\'

said.

\'I will have to warn my students, Dumbledore,\' Madame Maxime

\'Of course, Olympe. I would expect and advise nothing less.\' The phoenix let out a low cry. \'I must notify our ministry and the

aurors,\' Dumbledore said. \'Please do try not to touch anything, the area is quite strongly warded.\'

A second flash of fire washed over the clearing and the old wizard was gone.

\'Can we go back to the carriage?\' Gabby asked. \'I don\'t like this place, it feels angry\... and *cold*.\'

Fleur glanced at her younger sister. *She can still feel the magic after a month?* She shivered. *That means it had some real feeling in it.*

\'What do you feel, Gabby?\' Maman asked.

\'I don\'t want to.' Gabby shook her head and squeezed her eyes

shut. \'Please don\'t ask.\'

\'It\'s important, Gabby.\' Fleur took her sister's hand. 'Just listen to what you can feel for a minute.'

Gabby shuddered, but closed her eyes. \'It\'s distant,\' she muttered.

\'Far away and fading, but it must've been so strong.\' She shivered and

hunched into herself. \'It\'s like an echo. I don\'t think they died here, but the

magic's still clinging to them. It\'s like thick, black smoke.\'

Fleur stared. *You always describe magic like clothes, in colours and feelings. What on earth is this?*

\'And it\'s cold,\' Gabby whispered. \'It\'s so cold, like ice when your skin sticks to it. I --- I can\'t touch it. I don't want to stick to it. I don\'t want to touch it anymore. S'il te plaît, Fleur.\'

\'It\'s ok,\' Maman said. \'Stop listening.\' She turned to Fleur. \'Take her back to the carriage and keep her mind off it. I need to talk to Madame Maxime about aurors. Nobody talks to you two without asking my permission, especially in this country.\'

Fleur led Gabby back toward the pitch, heading straight for the light, rather than the circuitous route toward the carriage.

Gabby whimpered and dug her heels in. \'Not that way,\' she muttered. \'It\'s stronger that way.\'

\'Can you lead me to where it\'s strongest?\' Fleur asked.

Gabby grabbed Fleur's hand with both of hers and clutched it tight. She tip-toed through the pine needles until they came to stop only a few metres from the edge of the quidditch pitch. Gabby's shoulders trembled.

\'Let\'s go,\' she pleaded. \'Please, Fleur, let\'s go. It's angry. It's *so* angry. There's so much hate. I can feel it inside, like a blade of ice twisting in my chest. And it's empty underneath, like --- like sitting outside in winter until the cold and the dark seeped so far into you that you never felt anything else again.' She shuddered and buried her face in Fleur's shoulder. 'I've never known anything like this.'

'Let's go, Gabby.' Fleur clasped her sister's hand between hers and drew her away. 'Let me show you something magical. You can listen to the magic on it and see what you think. It's very nice magic.'

Gabby clung to Fleur's hand. An awful, dazed emptiness hovered

in her eyes.

*Merde. She's not been overwhelmed like this since she was little.*

Fleur bit her lip and hurried her sister up the stairs, pausing when they swung away, and being careful to step over the points that all of the other students avoided.

They passed a pudgy, shy boy Fleur'd seen in the vicinity of Harry\'s former friends. Beneath the glaze of her allure, Fleur glimpsed the strangest, strongest mixture of anger and sadness in his eyes.

The door wouldn\'t form when Fleur tried to create it. *Merde. Come on. Come on. Come on!*

Gabby waited, staring up at the ceiling with unfocused eyes. Fleur squeezed her hand, but her sister felt a thousand kilometres away.

*Open, you stupid room!* Heat bubbled up from her bones. Feathers slid from beneath her skin in short, pearl-white tufts. Fleur pulled her wand out, but the door formed before the first spell slipped from her lips.

She tugged Gabby inside.

\'Fleur.\' Harry dragged his eyes down from the walls. Silver photo frames faded from them. A strange distance seemed to yawn open between the two of them. \'I\'ll leave the room to you and your sister.\'

\'Thank you.'

He dipped his head, glancing at Gabby, then pausing to study Fleur's face. Concern flickered across his expression. 'Are you okay, Fleur? Your eyes... they're... *darker*.'

'We're fine.' Fleur smothered the heat of her change and felt the feathers slip back beneath her skin. 'Gabby just needs something to keep her mind off things.'

Silver frames began to form on the walls.

Harry's eyes flicked up. 'I should go, then.' He darted from the room.

Gabby tugged on Fleur's arm. 'You should have made him stay,

Fleur.'

'Hush, little chick.' Fleur let go of her sister's hands and shifted the

room into her sister's bedroom. 'Listen to the magic here.'

Gabby flinched.

'It's okay. This is the Room of Requirement. Harry Potter showed it to me after the Yule Ball. I told you a little bit about it in my letter, but not much, I didn\'t want to give away his secret.\'

Gabby closed her eyes and gasped. \'It\'s amazing. I can't pick anything out, there's so much!\' She bounded forward to the jar beside her bed, then pouted. 'My secret sweets stash isn't here.'

Fleur laughed. 'We're not *really* home, Gabby. This is a recreation based on what I want. The room can only mimic objects, it can't create anything like food.'

'Well then let's go back.' Gabby pulled a face. 'I need something warm to drink. Something warm, and sweet, and tasty.'

Fleur groaned. 'Which means you intend to drink what little's left of my hot chocolate stash, you greedy little bird. That would've lasted me a week and you've gone through it in a *day.*

# The Fire Within

Knee-high hedges criss-crossed the quidditch pitch. The shadow of the hoops loomed over them before the spring sun. The stands gathered dust at the edges.

'Heresy! Sacrilege!' Katie darted past Harry's shoulder and swung her foot at the hedge. 'Blasphemy!'

Nev dived in between, taking a solid kick in the shins. 'No! This is a really rare plant. I've never seen it outside of pictures and books. It's supposed to be nearly *impossible* to grow.'

Katie glowered. 'It's on the *quidditch pitch!*'

'You can't even use the pitch this year, Katie,' Harry said. 'I'm sure they'll take the hedges down for next year.'

'That doesn't mean they should ruin it!' Katie wound up for

another swing.

Nev stepped in between once more.

She paused. 'Really?'

'Maybe leave the hedge alone, Katie.' Harry let his wand slide out of his sleeve. 'I think Nev may be in love with it.'

Katie fumed. 'Well, at least the hedge doesn't have a stupid

French accent.'

Harry pretended he hadn't heard that. 'Given the context, Nev, I'd appreciate any useful insight about the hedge. Something tells me I may be getting intimately acquainted with it in a few weeks.'

Nev ran his fingers along the top of the hedge. 'It'll be really big in a few weeks. Twice our height.'

*Of course it will be.* Harry prodded it with his wand. *I bet it's got*

*some horrible catch to it, too. Like that gropy tentacle vine from first year.*

'Anything else?' Harry probed. 'Like, does it sprout thorns, emit a

foul smell, make loud noises, or anything else I might find inconvenient?'

Nev stopped patting the hedge. 'It's Lying Leylandii, a particularly rare type of cypress that's almost extinct. It needs a lot of magic to grow. A lot. It absorbs it like water.'

Harry eyed the little green rows and frowned. 'And what does it *do*

with all that magic?'

Nev shrugged. 'Not much. Well, it's all but impervious to any spells we can cast and when it's big enough, it even exudes a magically resistant mist, too.'

'What?' Katie snatched her wand out of her pocket. 'Incendio!' Noooo!' Nev cried.

A gout of flame washed through the nearest hedge.

Katie huffed. 'Not even scorched.' She stuffed her wand away. 'That's just not fair.'

Nev released a deep sigh and gave the hedge a gentle pat. 'Guess this little fellow's old enough to be pretty resistant already. By the time you're doing the task, there won't be many spells that'll be able to damage it.'

Harry turned that over in his head. 'So, what you're saying is it's going to be a complete pain.' He fished out a piece of parchment and started sketching the lie of the hedges. 'Best I plan ahead, then.'

Nev shuffled his feet. 'Actually, Harry. It's called Lying Leylandii because it rearranges itself all the time to deceive anything trying to get through it. That way the oldest part of the hedge, the most resistant bit, is always surrounding and protecting the new bits. That's why they went extinct, muggles cut all the wild hedges down and because it grows in patches together, they got it bit by bit. There's supposed to be some patches on the Isle of Skye and Anglesey, but that's all that's left in Britain. We didn't help, either. It used to be a fashionable thing to have a small maze of it, but when it went out of fashion, they all got cut down.'

'A maze...' Harry studied the lie of the hedges. 'A maze of

magically resistant, self-rearranging, giant hedges.'

'Yes.' Nev bobbed his head. 'People used to put their most valuable things in the middle of them. Or have competitions. It was supposed to be great fun.'

'Oh I'm sure I'll find out,' Harry muttered.

*Time to find some spells that will get through it, and let Viktor, Diggory, and Fleur worry about getting lost.*

Nev squirmed. 'I'm going to go find Professor Sprout, Harry. I've got so many questions for her about how she managed to get this to grow here.'

to do.'

Katie laughed. 'I think you're right, Harry. I think Neville *is* in love.' Neville squeaked. 'I'm *not.*'

'Go on, Nev.' Harry glanced at the hedges. 'I've got some thinking

Katie cocked her head and swiped a scatter of brown hair away

from her eyes. 'I'll stay. Nothing else urgent to do on a Saturday, anyway.'

'If you like.' Harry strolled round the edge of the hedges as Nev

disappeared toward the greenhouses.

Katie bounded after him. 'I like.' She kicked at the hedge again.

A ripple passed along the line from one side of the pitch to

another.

Harry tracked it. 'Maybe don't do that, please? It might remember

and take it out on me later.'

Katie grinned. 'Fair enough. But only if you tell me how your Yule

date with Frenchie went.'

'It wasn't a *date*,' Harry said.

'Looked like one to everyone else.' Katie laughed. 'Just ask Rita Skeeter. You could offer her an exclusive if you're mad at Frenchie, you know. Rita Skeeter likes taking a swing at her.'

'If I ever end up alone in a room with Rita Skeeter, one of us probably isn't leaving alive.'

'I reckon she could take you,' Katie said. 'Her fake nails look like they could take off a man's arm in a single swing.'

'To say nothing of her hair.' Harry grimaced. 'Anything with that

much bleach in it *must* be poisonous.'

Katie prodded him in the hip. 'Come on. Stop avoiding my question. Tell me about the gorgeous Fleur Delacour.'

Harry scowled. 'Let's just say we probably won't be attending many Yule Balls together in the future.'

*Or anything else.* He buried the memory of their brief encounter in the room of requirement. *No sense in getting wound up over it now. She's just another, well, another Katie, I suppose.*

Katie shrugged. 'Ah well. A shame, I guess, since she's really

pretty, obviously very clever, *and* has a sexy French accent*.'*

'Should I let her know you're interested?' Harry raised an eyebrow at her. 'That *is* why you're asking me, right?'

She laughed. 'No. I just wanted to make sure you were okay.' 'Well, I'm fine.' He paused beneath the hoops on the far side from

the school. 'I've had dates that ended worse...'

She squirmed. 'Well, you need to be with someone you enjoy spending time with and understands you. So if she couldn't do that, then she wasn't the one for you anyway.'

'Exactly,' Harry said.

*But Fleur does understand me. And I did enjoy spending time with her. I still do, even though I know she's just using her allure on me.* He stifled a sigh and smothered a fist-sized hollow lurking somewhere around his heart. *She doesn't feel the same way for some reason. Nothing can be done.*

Katie poked him on the arm. 'Oi. Stop thinking about other girls when you're with me. You're only allowed to fantasise about me tying my hair up or not wearing a seashell bra when we're together.'

Harry snorted. 'Alright. Alright. It's your fault for bringing it up,

anyway.'

'Fair.' Katie did a little spin and cackled. 'Bet you're not thinking about her right now, are you? I reckon it's all seashells and brown eyes. No silver and blue to be seen.'

Fleur's bright blue eyes and warm smile swirled through Harry's thoughts. 'It's a good thing I've already seen a fair amount of you in the locker room, otherwise it'd be really hard to imagine you in that seashell bra.'

'Oh, watching me change, were you?' Katie beamed. 'You never

mentioned *that* before.'

'It wasn't deliberate. I was, like, twelve. Wasn't even interested, just curious.'

'Want to find out if I've still got cooties?' Katie winked. 'There's only one way...'

Harry chuckled. 'I've got to go plan for this maze.' He leant in. Katie's breath caught.

'Don't tell, Nev,' he whispered, 'but I'm definitely going to try and find a way of destroying the hedges.'

A small smile appeared on her lips. 'Well, you have fun. I'm going to go find Angelina and Alicia. Gossip time!' She bounced away.

*And I'm going to go find Salazar.* Harry laughed to himself and headed toward the chamber. *Who's probably even more gossipy than they are in the right mood.*

Myrtle's sobs echoed out from her cubicle over the puddle on the

floor. Harry crept through and down into the Chamber of Secrets.

'Salazar?'

'What?'

Harry stepped into the study. 'Know anything about magically

resistant plants?'

'Helga did.' Salazar's green eyes turned distant. 'She knew everything there was to know.'

'What about Lying Lily-something?'

'Lying Leylandii?' Salazar uncoiled the serpent from around his neck and shook it off his hand onto the floor. 'Tricky plant, that.'

'There's a maze of it on the quidditch pitch.'

'Auspicious timing.' Salazar stroked his chin. 'How old is it?' 'No idea.'

Salazar nodded, fending off his snake with one hand. 'Probably doesn't matter too much. There's a lot of magic in this area, that's the whole reason we built the school here, so let's assume it's going to be as strong as it can grow to be. You'll find a *very* magically resistant plant that emits a thick, magically resistant fog.'

Harry frowned. 'Right. So what do I do?'

'Well, you can't map it. The maze walls will move. So either you have to stumble through on the day or find a way to breach the walls.' Salazar tapped his fingers in a slow staccato atop his serpent's head. 'There aren't many spells that can destroy something that magically resistant.'

'Which one shall I try for?'

Salazar sighed. 'Given what we know about Tom and the horcruxes he's made, Fiendfyre is probably something you're going to have to learn anyway.'

'Fiendfyre.' Harry hid a grin behind his hand. 'But -- but that's *dark*

*magic*.'

'There's no such thing!' Salazar wrung his snake like a wet rag.

'You *know* there isn't --- oh, you're winding me up, aren't you, you ungrateful little urchin.'

'It brings me untold joy.' Harry slipped his wand out of his sleeve. 'So what do I do?'

'We're not doing Fiendfyre in the study.' Salazar grimaced. 'We shouldn't even do it in the chamber, really.'

'It's that bad?'

'You've no idea.' Salazar's eyes darkened. 'It's hard to learn or cast, but more importantly, it takes a wizard or witch of rare willpower to control it.' The painting clapped his hands together. 'I've no doubt you'll manage it, but I do wish we'd somewhere else for you to learn.'

'Room of Requirement?' Harry hauled the painting off the wall

and carried it out over the bridge. 'Would that be better?'

'No.' Salazar shook his head. 'Godric and Rowena's magic will be more delicate than the blood magic I used here.'

Harry set the portrait down. 'Right, so, incantation?'

'No incantation.' Salazar draped his serpent over his shoulders. 'Fiendfyre's not really a spell, not like the charms or curses you've learnt. Like soul magic and blood magic, it sits at the farthest, most abstract and complex branch of destructive magic. You have to want to destroy

whatever you're casting it at. You have to want it so much you manifest

your intent as an avatar of flame.'

'Can it be something other than flame?' Harry asked.

'It could, but there are few things that better fit the idea of destroying something than burning it to ashes.' Salazar stroked his chin. 'Try it on that irritating golden egg. Make sure, though, you keep your focus. I don't want to be burnt to ash just yet.'

Harry fetched the golden egg and set it down on the floor. 'So, I just have to want to destroy it.'

'It can't just be a whim. It takes no small amount of desire.' Salazar eyed the golden egg. 'If I were a person and not just a painting, I'd have no trouble with that irritating paperweight. You seem bizarrely fond of it, though, so I'd suggest thinking of something else that you do want destroyed.'

'Right.' Harry struggled to find something he hated. Something he

could watch turn to ash with a smile on his face.

Privet Drive flashed before his eyes. The neat, square hedges, trimmed grass, pruned roses, and Aunt Petunia's precious patch of lilies. Uncle Vernon's polished car and neat garage. The fake, sweet smiles Dudley aimed at the neighbours.

*The whole, ugly, perfect, stereotype.*

Ice lanced through Harry's veins as he pictured it crumbling into

flames.

He thrust his wand at the egg. A flicker of red flame spurted from

his wand and splashed over the egg. It melted through the gold casing like boiling water through snow. Half the egg vanished as the fiendfyre coiled round it like a viper.

'Bloody hell,' Harry whispered. 'That's unbelievable.' 'Don't lose focus!' Salazar cried. 'Don't let it grow.' 'Let it grow?' Harry glanced at the painting.

The red flame flared up as if he'd hurled petrol over it. Heat seared at Harry's face and hands. Hungry whispers echoed from the crackle of the flames as the rest of the egg vanished.

'Put it out!' Salazar yelled. 'Put it out! Opposite intent, strong will!'

Harry took a deep breath. *Something I don't want to see destroyed.* Fleur's face hovered in his thoughts. Hogwarts' towers rose behind her silver hair and blue eyes.

The Fiendfyre faded and guttered out.

He swiped the sweat off his brow and winced at the toll. 'That's

*way* more dangerous than anything else I've learnt.'

'You know how to fracture your own soul.' Salazar peered at the patch of scorched stone. 'At least you got it out before it did any damage to the chamber. Fiendfyre damage is almost always permanent.'

Harry grimaced. 'I still need to practice.'

'No more today.' Salazar pointed his wand at the seared flagstone. 'You're tired. Do it tomorrow when you're fresh, once you've managed to start it and put it out a good few times, then you can start pushing things a bit.'

'Probably wise.'

'*Probably wise,'* Salazar mimicked in a falsetto. 'I am *Salazar Slytherin*. Literally the greatest wizard to walk these isles and a good number of other places, too. *Probably wise...*'

'You're quite tetchy today,' Harry said. 'Did your snake keep you up last night?'

'It won't stay still!' Salazar wrenched the serpent into a knot and hurled it into the background of his painting. 'Wretched reptile. It'll be back in a few moments. The more I throw it away, the clingier it gets; it's like a bad penny with a really tickly tongue and terrible breath.'

Harry chuckled. 'Well, on that note, I'll go do some research on maze competitions in wizarding Britain while a thousand pictures of Fleur stare at me.'

'Sounds like great fun,' Salazar quipped. 'You know, instead of sulking in a room with a load of creepy pictures, you could try and talk to her.'

*And get enthralled and messed with again? No thanks.*

'At least *her* pictures don't talk.' Harry strode toward the entrance. 'Or have annoying snakes!'

'Don't leave me on the floor, Harry!' Salazar shouted. 'Put me back up on the wall!'

He snorted. 'I'll be back in a few hours.' Salazar's curses echoed up the steps after him.

# Four Champions One Cup

The hedges of the maze towered over Harry, more than three times his height. A thick, grey fog hung over it like the whole thing was swarming with dementors.

*Which it'd better not be.* Harry peered through the mist. *I draw the line there. Although I wouldn't mind testing to see if Fiendfyre is more effective than a patronus. Awful creatures.*

The crowd filling the quidditch stands cheered and drummed their hands on the rails.

\'All our champions are here,\' Ludo Bagman boomed. \'That means it\'s almost time to begin!\'

Harry eyed his rivals. Cedric stared into the maze with a worried gleam in his eyes. Viktor ran through a few stretches, flexing his knees and arms as if he were about to play quidditch.

Harry dragged his gaze back onto the maze. *Best not to think*

*about how Fleur's looking.*

Viktor stood up and patted Harry on the shoulder with a firm hand. \'I have not forgotten the fish, da.\'

Harry smiled. \'I was afraid if you had, I might have to conjure them

again.'

Viktor laughed and thumped Harry on the back. 'That's the way!

Da! This will be good fun.'

Ludo Bagman cleared his throat. \'Not more than a few minutes ago my assistant and I, accompanied by Alastor Moody, placed the Triwizard Trophy at the centre of the maze. The first one to retrieve it wins.

If, at any point, you wish to withdraw, you need only send up red sparks from your wand.\'

\'What about the points?\' Cedric asked.

\'Mr Krum will enter first, as he has the most points, and for every point the next champion is behind him, ten seconds will be lost.\'

Cedric frowned. 'More than a minute,' he muttered.

\'Is there anything we should know about the maze?\' Fleur's blue

eyes drifted over the hedges.

Ludo Bagman shrugged. \'I can\'t tell you anything that might help

you.'

mist?'

Harry stepped forward. 'How can everyone watch, with all that

Ludo Bagman grinned. 'Fantastic question, Harry. Short answer is,

we can't. After a couple of hedges, we lose all contact.' Fleur's eyebrows arched.

*Yes, he does seem to be more keen to help me than anyone else, doesn't he?* The hairs prickled on Harry's neck. *He's not the defence against the dark arts professor, though, so maybe he's just placed a bet on me. He does have a reputation as a gambler according to Rita Skeeter.*

'Mr Krum?' Ludo Bagman produced a chewed, wooden whistle.

'Ready?'

'Da.'

Harry peered at the mist. *Three hedges should be far enough. If*

*they lose all contact at two, then they won't see a small amount of Fiendfyre beyond three.*

\'Well, I suppose that\'s really all there is to it.\' Ludo Bagman blew the whistle.

Viktor flew forward into the darkness of the maze.

*He\'s fast.*

'Trente cinq. Trente quatre. Trente trois.' Fleur's whispered countdown goaded Harry's heart into pounding.

*At twenty. It's me.* He leant forwards. *On your marks, get set...*

'Vingt deux. Vingt et un. Vingt---'

*Go!* Harry darted into the maze, leaving Bagman's shrill whistle

behind him.

Faint light filtered down through the mist. Between the towering hedges, it felt dark as dusk. Harry picked his way over the roots and grass, his blood pounding loud as thunder in his head, his wand clutched in his fist.

Footprints went left at the first fork*.*

Harry turned right. *Best not to catch Viktor with the Fiendfyre.*

The path followed a gentle curve into the gloom.

Harry broke into a run, turning left and right each time they took him toward the centre. He smacked into something hard and bounced off into the hedge. Branches stabbed at his back and small, tongue-shaped leaves tickled his face.

The walls of the maze shivered and rippled, roots shifted under the dirt, and he was dragged several metres to his right.

Harry hauled himself out of the hedge. The original obstacle loomed closer, clicking its pincers.

*Bloody hell.* He raised his wand, watching the eight almost life- size reflections of himself. *Who let Hagrid help?*

\'Lacero,\' he hissed.

The flash of purple light put out one of the reflections. The acromantula gnashed its mandibles; thick, sticky green liquid dripped from its ruined eye.

'Lacero.' Harry cast a few more.

The curse gouged lines into the acromantula\'s carapace and Harry back-stepped as fast as he could. The giant spider surged forward. He dived underneath its pincers, rolled to the side, and disillusioned himself. The acromantula clicked its mandibles, stalking up and down over the top of him.

*please.*

*Right, go search somewhere a bit further down so I can sneak off,*

The acromantula began to spin a web across the path, blocking

Harry\'s way further into the maze.

*Shit. I forgot they're pretty smart.* Harry squinted at the webbing.

*That stuff's as thick as my bicep and spider-silk's stronger than steel*

*cables.* He scowled. *Now what? I can't get through the damn exo-skeleton.*

Harry paused and bounced his wand in his hand. *Skeleton...*

\'Osassula,\' he whispered, flicking his wand in an inverted c shape.

The bone-splintering curse missed the spider\'s carapace, but struck one of the legs. The limb shattered and the acromantula screeched and stumbled. Harry fired off three more bone-splintering curses; two more

legs snapped on the same side. The spider collapsed into the hedge, curling its legs in on itself, keening, and gnashing its pincers.

He stared down at the writhing spider. *Injured animals are dangerous*. *And it\'s in a lot of pain.*

Harry transfigured a long, thin, steel spike from a broken piece of spider leg and banished it deep into the acromantula\'s skull. He stepped over the spider\'s still legs, dropped his invisibility, and ducked through a gap in the webbing.

The maze began to curve in toward the centre and the urge to cast Fiendfyre began to coil tighter in his chest. *Not yet. I need to make sure I'm far enough in. Nobody can see what I cast or there'll be more stupid rumours.*

Heavy footfalls thudded up ahead. Harry disillusioned himself.

A horrific cross between a scorpion and a lobster prowled the path before him. The slime-coated nightmare shot a shower of sparks from its end and propelled forward into the hedge, flailing its stinger all around.

Harry sprinted past it and around the corner. He paused and listened, but the thudding faded away into the distance. *Whatever the hell that was, I'm sure Hagrid loves it dearly.*

A fork lay at his feet round the next gentle corner. No footprints marked either path. Harry glanced up into the mist. No patch of bright betrayed the location of the sun.

*Idiot.* He placed his wand flat on his palm. \'Point me north,\' he murmured.

*Not even a real spell, but the intent's pretty simple.* His ebony wand swirled to point down the left fork. *North takes me close enough to the centre to use fiendfyre and get the cup before anyone else.*

Harry made it fourteen steps before the mist thickened. A dementor loomed out of it. Grim, rattling breaths echoed from under its tattered hood and withered, skeletal hands clutched at the air.

'I *knew* it,' Harry muttered as the cold crept into him. He abandoned his disillusionment and dragged the memory of his parents in the Mirror of Erised to the forefront of his mind. \'Expecto patronum.'

A half-hearted, sluggish, silver mist poured from his wand tip onto the floor and swirled around his feet.

*That\'s not meant to happen. What happened to Prongs?*

A feathered wing tip rose out of the mist at his feet, bursting into nothing. The dementor shivered and shifted in a seamless blur of motion.

Harry stared at emerald eyes, messy, ebony hair, and a jagged scar behind wide-framed glasses. A distant, endless void loomed in his double's green eyes, like the weight of a thousand metres of cold, dark water crushing down upon him.

\'We\'re nothing.\' It spoke with his voice, but flat and dead as concrete slabs. 'We were nothing when we played hero. We're nothing now. There's no escape. There's nothing more. Whether they understand us or not, they just. Don't. Care.\'

'Someone will.' Harry raised his wand and tore his eyes away

from the dazed, numb look in his doppelganger's eyes. 'I'll find them.'

\'No. They won't. There's no exceptions. We're all shallow, selfish things. They'll never be anything different.' It took a step forward. 'We can't forget that. We mustn't forgive it.' Its eyes glowed red; the soft,

hypnotic crimson of glowing coals, the precise hue of the eyes that'd peered out from behind the fragment of Harry's soul. 'If they're all going to be selfish, then we'll beat them at it. Winning is all that counts when there's nothing else left. And in the end, even winning means nothing when you're left holding the trophy alone.'

A deep well of hatred boiled up in Harry's heart and his wand snapped up. Crimson flames billowed from its tip, rippling over the boggart and down the path in front of him. The heat seared at Harry's face and hungry whispers echoed from the crackle and snap of the fire.

*I\'m done with this maze.* He took a deep breath of scorching air and smiled as the ashes of the boggart rained down. *I'm going to win. And I'm going to find someone who understands. An equal.*

The flames twisted, writhing and rising in the form of a vast serpent. A basilisk of white-hot, flame lunged forward, trailing crimson- tipped tongues of fire. Harry directed it forward with his wand, strolling through the smoking gaps in the hedge as he strode north toward the maze's centre.

A girl's scream echoed from ahead.

*Fleur.* A host of dangerous creatures flitted through his thoughts.

The blood-clouded water of the Black Lake and Fleur's desperate look

hung before the eye of his mind.

The fiendfyre serpent twisted aside from its path, the flames flaring bright as the sun.

*No!* Harry crushed all thought of destruction and the snake collapsed into nothing. He sprinted through the floating ashes of the hedges.

Fleur sprawled on the path, her silver hair draped over her face. Her wand lay beside her hand, glowing from the strength of the magic

she'd been casting. Her chest rose and fell as if she slept, but tiny spasms

and tremors rippled through her limbs and face.

*The Cruciatus Curse causes that.* Ice closed round his heart and green light flickered at the tip of his wand. *She's still alive, but whoever did this isn't going to be for long.*

A yellow curse hissed past his face, carving into the ground behind him.

'Viktor,' Harry hissed, twisting round and rising to his feet.

Bone-splintering curses flashed from his wand, slicing into the hedge. Viktor threw himself to one side, rolling across the path and back to his feet.

\'Not me,\' he yelled. \'Not me!\'

Harry raised his wand again. \'Then who?\'

\'Diggory!'

Harry's body lit up with pain.

*It hurts more than anything.* The memory of tearing his own soul rose up in the back of his mind; thick, ink-black mist and the agonised screams of his fractured self. *No, no it doesn't. It just hurts a lot.*

He struggled to his feet and raised his wand. \'Lacero.'

The curse sliced a deep, crimson line along Cedric\'s cheekbone and the Hufflepuff faltered. He shook his head and pressed a hand to his temple. 'Eliminate the other champions,' he muttered. 'Eliminate them however I can.'

*Just like Barty Crouch Junior...*

\'Avada Kedavra!\' Diggory screamed.

Harry flinched aside from the flash of green light. A distinct thud came from behind him.

His heart sank and the ice tightened its grasp. *Viktor... This can\'t be Cedric. He's not capable of that. Something's messed with his head. Something like the Imperius Curse.*

He threw himself flat and pictured wiping a window clean, focusing

on the moment Ludo Bagman had first blown the whistle. 'Obliviate.'

Diggory staggered, his mouth opened and closed several times.

\'Harry?' He blinked. 'What? Where?' \'Stupefy.'

The red beam struck Cedric square in the chest and he slumped to the ground.

Harry ran his eyes over the other champions. *I've won.* A lead weight rested on his heart. *No. I haven't. Someone else did this, not me.* He took a deep breath. *Voldemort. It's always bloody Voldemort.*

He glanced at Cedric. 'But you cast two Unforgivables\... They'll send you to Azkaban.'

Harry bent and picked up Cedric\'s wand. *Cedric is the pawn they want to blame things on. If it's Voldemort then he's after me again, and Fleur and Viktor were just in the way.*

He raised Cedric's wand high in the air, shooting a bright burst of red sparks up into the sky, and snapped the wand in half, tossing the pieces aside. 'Sorry, Cedric. I know how much losing a wand hurts, but it's the best I can do. Someone will come find you and poor Viktor.' Harry

stared down at Fleur. His heart wrenched like someone'd twisted a knife in it. 'I --- I can't leave *you* here.'

*Am I still enthralled somehow?* He slipped the rosewood wand back into her belt and scooped Fleur into his arms, cradling her against his chest with his left arm and keeping his right free to use his wand. *I'll take you with me, straight to the trophy, then we're both finished with this.*

Harry steeled himself and unleashed a rippling wave of fiendfyre. The hedges in front turned to ash. Harry squashed the flames and fell to one knee as the strain caught up to him.

*It will end soon.* He pushed himself back up and swept Fleur's hair

off her face with his finger. *Almost done, Fleur.*

A single ring of hedge remained on the far side of the field of ashes and embers. A sphinx sat in the only visible gap, watching him with an unreadable expression on its feminine face.

\'I\'d like to go through.\' Harry paused before the sphinx, hot ashes

swirling about his feet. 'Preferably as soon as I can.'

\'I can see that.\' The sphinx laughed; its beautiful, female voice carried a strange double timbre that tugged at Harry's thoughts. \'You have to answer the riddle, or you can try to force your way through, if you'd rather.\'

*Fighting a sphinx is probably a bad idea at the best of times, let alone now.*

\'The riddle, please,' Harry said.

\'A silent favour, a priceless gift; worn but not woven, a lipped rift.' 'How many guesses do I get?\' Harry asked. 'And is there a time

limit?'

\'A good question to ask.\' The sphinx's smile widened. \'Normally, if we met by chance, you would only have three, but since I came here especially to test Salazar\'s descendant...\'

Harry felt the sinking feeling return. 'That doesn't mean extra guesses, does it...'

\'No, little human. You only get one. I hope you don\'t disappoint

me.\'

Harry let out a weak chuckle. \'So do I.'

*If I die, Fleur's vulnerable.*

\'If you don\'t mind,\' he said. \'Just in case I *do* disappoint.\' Harry placed the tip of his wand on Fleur\'s forehead and cast

Salazar\'s favourite protective ward-curse on her skin.

*There, anyone who touches her intending her harm in the next few hours will wither to dust.*

\'I\'m sorry.' Harry managed a rueful grin. 'I seem to have forgotten

the riddle while casting that.\'

\'A silent favour, a priceless gift; worn but not woven, a lipped rift.' The sphinx shifted its weight and yawned, revealing lots of sharp, curved teeth.

*What's silent, a gift, and worn?* Harry tried to drag something out of his thoughts. *Clothes? Shoes? No, clothes probably count as woven.* He sighed. *This is worse than divination used to be, at least I didn't actually die at the end of those lessons.*

\'I don\'t suppose you give hints?\' he asked.

'I'm afraid not.' The sphinx's smile stretched so wide Harry

thought it might leave its face.

*Smile. It's a smile. You wear a smile, you can give someone a smile, or favour them with a smile, and smiles are on your lips.* Harry basked in his moment of inspiration. *I'm really rather proud of that.*

'A smile.'

A splitting pain erupted in his head and Harry clapped his free hand to his face. *I was wrong?*

\'No,\' the sphinx said. \'I was just curious.\'

\'Legilimency\...'

\'Indeed. Or, at least, that's the closest your kind can come to what we do.\' The sphinx leant to one side to let him pass. \'I will enjoy watching what happens to you, Harry Potter, Heir of Slytherin. For answering my riddle correctly, you may pass, for passing my test, I offer this. A second riddle, of sorts, that might help end a more troublesome third.'

'Okay.' Harry waited with baited breath. 'I'm listening. Confused, but listening.'

The sphinx laughed. 'When is victory not really victory? When

does falling to your last enemy stop being defeat?\'

*Well, that made absolutely no sense.* Harry watched the sphinx take flight. *Was it even meant to be here for the tournament or did it just come for me?*

He gathered Fleur into his arms and staggered round the corner.

The triwizard cup gleamed not five metres away upon a marble plinth.

*Now we're done, Fleur.* He stumbled to the plinth and leant her against it, resting her head back on the stone. *There, otherwise you're*

*going to get a real crick in your neck while we wait.* Harry paused and dragged some of the dregs of his magic up to cast a warming charm on Fleur.

Harry sighed and smoothed her silver hair out. 'You know, Fleur. I don\'t know what you did to me with your allure in the room or in the lake, but if I could somehow trade this cup to make you feel I was more important than winning, I'd do it in a heartbeat.' He tucked his wand back up his sleeve and reached out with his right hand to take the trophy. 'But I guess wishes like that just don't come true, do they?'

# A Grave Mistake

A brutal wrench tore Harry from the maze's centre. He hit the ground hard, bouncing across it onto his knees. The cup and his wand spilt from his hands and skittered away into the gloom.

*The cup's a portkey?* He shrugged and pushed himself to his feet, ignoring the soft throb of new bruises. *Good. They'll be able to get to Fleur sooner.*

A thin, grey mist curled around his feet; it hung around and over rows of pale tombstones.

*This isn't Hogwarts.* Harry's heart plummeted into his stomach. He tried to apparate away to the chamber, but when he stepped forward, the world remained still as stone. *Fuck.*

The mist billowed past his feet, drifting from behind him. Harry grimaced and swivelled 'round. A bright-faced witch with curly brown hair smiled at him over the top of a very large cauldron. The mist spilt from its top like froth over the sides of a mug.

\'Hiya Harry!' She tipped the brim of the blue beret perched upon

her curls. \'Nice of you to join us.\'

*Us?* He glanced round. *Royal plural, or has she been possessed by*

*another item from Voldemort's stationery cupboard?*

\'Do I know you?\' Harry asked.

\'Oh no, Harry, you don\'t *know* me.\' She giggled. \'*Nobody* really knows me. I\'m just the talkative, cheerful witch who listens. My name's Bertha Jorkins.\'

\'You worked for Crouch.\' Harry searched every thin spot in the mist for his wand. 'I remember your name coming up at the World Cup. You disappeared.'

\'Sorry, Harry.\' Bertha Jorkins waved a familiar piece of ebony in the air. Thick, black ropes leapt from his wand, pinning him to the nearest headstone.

\'For the briefest moment I hoped I was wrong,\' he quipped, straining at the ropes.

\'Well, you weren\'t!\' She laughed. \'You see, when I left Hogwarts, I wasn\'t good enough to get where I wanted to go. I didn\'t even want that much, you know. Just enough to live on. Something interesting to do.

Nobody noticed me in the war, though I helped Barty Crouch by keeping an eye on a fair few suspicious members of the ministry and was responsible for the capture of more than one Death Eater. Not one person ever thanked me for it, you know. Not even Barty Crouch.'

Harry tried to twist his wrists free. 'That actually doesn't surprise me, Barty Crouch doesn't seem like a great person.'

Bertha flashed him a pair of dimples. 'I learnt from it, though. I learnt that knowing secrets and using them for other people\'s good gains you nothing, not even gratitude, and I refused to repeat my mistake. I kept making friends even when things calmed down, I\'ve always been good with people, you see. Someone who listens can be invaluable and you learn all sorts of things if you listen long enough. One day, I came across something very interesting indeed. My oh-so-perfect, principled, head of department Barty Crouch had snuck his son out from Azkaban. I meant to blackmail him, but I needed proof, so I went looking.\'

'I'm sure that went well,\' Harry muttered.

She giggled. \'Barty Crouch Junior was not what I was expecting.

He was nothing like his father at all. I found a young wizard driven to

madness by Azkaban and the Imperius Curse of his own parent, and emotionally-scarred by his father in the years before. In the few moments of lucidity he gained, he'd tell me about his master, the one who recognised his value when his father and the world deemed him worthless.\'

\'You believed him?\'

\'Not to begin with,\' she admitted. \'The Dark Lord was supposed to be dead, but *then*, his servant came and found us.\'

\'He was still alive?\' Harry gasped with mock horror and tested the strength of his bindings.

*They're actually not that tight.* He struggled with the desire to tear himself free. *Wait for the right moment.*

\'He was very much alive.\' Bertha tittered. \'He showed me that I was not so useless with magic as I'd come to believe. He taught me that I was simply thinking about things the wrong way. I could always listen to people, get them to trust me, to talk to me, to do what I want. I never guessed I would have such a talent with the Imperius Curse, one that even the Dark Lord respects.\'

\'He taught you a spell, so you fight for him?\' Harry blinked. 'That's

all?'

\'He respected me for the one thing I know I'm good at! *That's* why

I follow him, because nobody else ever did that for me! And what does all the rest matter? Barty Crouch fed a whole host of innocent souls to the dementors, people he only half-suspected. The Dark Lord's killed no more than a few dozen wizards... And always fighting fairly, too.\'

\'He\'s lying to you.'

\'You aren\'t going to convince me, Harry. I\'ve come too far to turn back even if I wanted to, and I *don\'t*.\'

\'What *have* you done?\' Harry squirmed his fingers free. \'I assume the disappearance of Crouch was you?\'

\'Yes. Yours truly.\' Bertha smirked and tipped her beret at him. \'He was too suspicious. When I vanished and Barty died free of the curse, he began to connect things other people couldn\'t. I waited as long as possible to make it appear an unrelated event, but he had to die the moment Pettigrew went missing. I assumed, mistakenly in the end, that he'd captured Pettigrew, or, if someone else had, Crouch might learn enough to stop us. It took so much planning to get you here, Harry.\' She laughed. \'We spent hours devising a plan just to get your name in the goblet. So many complex pieces of magic, all destined to be ineffective. Ludo and I struggled terribly. Of course, it hardly helped that I had to keep him under the Imperius the whole time.\'

*Bagman*. *Bagman could get to Fleur.* A cold chill gripped his spine.

*No. She's safe.* The ice thawed from his blood. *The Withering Curse will protect her.*

\'So how did you do it?\' Harry wriggled his right hand free of the

ropes. 'You can't lie to the goblet. And I certainly didn't enter myself.'

'Ah, you did your research.\' Bertha Jorkins laughed. 'We failed a fair few times, but we did notice that the goblet's fire flared each time we tried, so Ludo and I waited until the names were being pulled out. We cast one more confundus charm on it after the other champions were chosen and the goblet flared up. A well-prepared piece of parchment, a Levitating Charm, and a Disillusionment Charm, and Albus Dumbledore thought he was holding the name of the fourth champion.'

'I didn't even have to compete, did I?' Harry shook his head. 'And there I was looking for some complicated way to hoodwink the goblet.'

'The Dark Lord explained that Dumbledore would see through any complicated piece of magic that truly got you entered, but might overlook something simple. It wasn't worth the risk to tamper too much, either.' Bertha shrugged her shoulders. 'I can't say I disagree. The goblet would've probably ripped the magic right out of us if we'd tried anything more than what we did.'

Harry nodded and slipped his right arm free. 'Well, don't let me stop your explanation. What about the cup?'

\'A simple portkey. Ludo popped it on its plinth and I waited inside the maze and placed the Imperius Curse on the Diggory boy after he ran in. We just needed to wait for him to deal with the other two, then you'd arrive.' Bertha Jorkins flashed her dimples at him again. 'Which brings us to what we\'re really doing here waiting for you.\'

\'We?\' Harry asked. 'I hope you mean Ludo Bagman, but since he's quite hard to miss and these tombstones aren't *that* broad, I've a nasty feeling you don't.'

\'We.\' The sibilant whisper of Voldemort\'s shade echoed from somewhere nearby.

\'Hello, Voldemort.\' Harry tugged his other arm free and gathered

the ropes binding his chest into his hands. 'Where are you?'

\'You\'ve learnt some manners,\' the wraith whispered. \'No more

chatting, Bertha. It's *time*.\'

\'Yes, master!' Bertha waved Harry\'s wand at the cauldron and bright flames sprang up around it.

*I'd really rather whatever that cauldron's for didn't happen.* He shifted his weight and tensed himself to spring.

The fires guttered out. Bertha frowned at Harry\'s wand.

\'Use your own,\' Voldemort hissed. \'It will not matter anymore.\'

She nodded, tucking Harry\'s wand into a pocket and withdrawing a short, thick piece of what looked like hazel.

The cauldron fires relit and the surface sparked, releasing a scatter of glowing orange pinpricks every few seconds. They drifted across the nearby gravestones like fireflies, following the mist that fled from the heat of the flames.

Bertha Jorkins bent to the floor on one side of the cauldron. Harry shoved the rest of the ropes over his head and tossed them away behind a headstone. She stood back up holding a hairless, scabbed thing with leprous, slimy skin, then lowered it into the cauldron.

*Please drown.* Harry's heart pounded against his ribs. *Whatever that is, Voldemort or not, please let it drown.*

\'Bone of the father,\' Bertha sang. \'Unknowingly given, you will renew your son.\'

The ground at Harry\'s feet cracked open and a stream of white dust flew into the cauldron. Orange sparks exploded off the surface, then it turned a poisonous blue so bright it seared Harry's eyes.

\'Flesh of the servant.\' Bertha's voice trembled. \'Willingly sacrificed, you will revive your master.\' She produced a gleaming silver knife from her robes, placing her left hand on the edge of the cauldron. 'Sacrifices have to be made,' she breathed, and brought the blade down on her wrist.

Blood spurted. Bertha screamed, her half-severed hand hanging over the potion. Harry held his breath. Bertha let out a strangled sob and hacked her hand free. It splashed into the cauldron and the liquid rippled a raging red.

*Now's my chance. I just need to get my wand back so I can overpower her. Voldemort's just a wraith.*

\'Blood of the enemy.\' She staggered toward Harry, blood oozing from the half-cauterised stump of her arm. \'Forcibly taken, you will resurrect your foe.\' She lunged and lashed out.

The blade's tip drew a line of fire across his cheek.

Harry jumped to his feet and ripped his wand from Bertha's robes. It bounced into the mist. Bertha rolled away from him and tossed the knife into the cauldron with a whimper. The potion flared a blinding, shimmering white. Steam poured off it, forming a thick creeping blanket of fog.

Something tall stepped toward him through the mist.

*Too tall to be Bertha and with way too little curly hair.* Harry scrambled for his wand. *Where did it go?* He thrust his arm out to summon it.

A long-fingered, pale-skinned hand snatched his wand out of the air in front of him. Voldemort's serpentine, slitted, red eyes stared down at him. Misshapen features and translucent, blue-veined skin surrounded them.

\'Where are you going, Harry?\' A thin smile crossed Voldemort's

colourless lips.

\'Back to Hogwarts?\' Harry pushed himself back to his feet.

*I\'m stronger now. And he doesn't know. All it takes is one*

*moment and I can escape.*

\'I don\'t think so,\' Voldemort whispered. \'I can understand why you'd want to return there, Harry. It feels like home to begin with, a new world, a place where you belong, but then that world turns out to be no

better than what you thought you\'d left behind. You\'ll see that soon enough, if you haven\'t already.\' Voldemort\'s lips curled back in a cold grin. \'I didn\'t just want you here for the ritual, Harry. There were easier ways to get your blood, even if it needed to be taken against your will and still be fresh. No, you\'re here to bear witness to my return.\' He crooked a long finger at Bertha. 'Bertha...'

\'My Lord,\' she murmured, stumbling forward clutching at her arm. \'Your arm, Bertha.\'

She proffered her unharmed limb towards her lord. \'Sorry, my lord,\' she whispered as Voldemort pushed up her sleeve.

*Really?* Harry's eyebrow shot up. Voldemort's lips crooked.

A black tattoo of a snake entwined within a skull throbbed upon her upper forearm, bulging half a centimetre from the skin and writhing beneath its surface. Voldemort studied it and pressed his long, pale forefinger into her skin. Bertha\'s fingers curled into a fist and she squeezed her eyes shut.

A host of dark cloaked figures appeared around them in a series of loud cracks and pops.

*How did they apparate in?* Harry attempted to apparate out again, picturing the chamber, but remained rooted to the spot. *There must be some kind of ward. Bertha must've set it up.*

\'Ah.\' Voldemort sighed. \'My family returns. My friends. My so very

*loyal* followers.\'

The circle of robed and masked figures surrounding the two of them trembled. Bertha Jorkins snatched her beret off the floor and stumbled away into one of the many gaps.

\'It feels just as it did thirteen years ago.\' Voldemort's smile twisted into something cold. \'Only then you had not *betrayed* me, not *abandoned* me, not forsaken the oaths you swore to stand beside me.' He whirled on the nearest Death Eater. \'Lucius, you were content to continue following the old ways, having your fun at the World Cup, but never did you search for me.' Voldemort ripped the silver skull mask from Malfoy's face and prowled the circle. \'Crabbe, Goyle, Nott, all of you have forgotten the words you said when I gave you your marks. You are hale, healthy, and enjoying the full comforts of your powers just as you have been for the last decade.\'

\'Master...\' The stooped figure of Nott quailed. *'Please*, master.'

*\'Silence*,\' Voldemort hissed. \'These gaps, these are where those who truly stood with me have their place. Those who never renounced me, were never disloyal; those who are in Azkaban and those who are dead.\' He stalked around the inside of the circle, bare-foot, his robes whispering along the ground. \'You have disappointed me, you have all disappointed me *gravely*...\'

A trembling figure stepped out of the circle and prostrated themselves before Voldemort. \'Please, master,\' he begged. \'Forgive me, forgive all of us, we were afraid.\'

*\'Forgive you.*\' Voldemort's voice turned cold as ice. \'Get *up*, Avery.

Stand next to me, like you swore you would.\' He reached out and took Avery\'s chin between his thumb and forefinger. \'You ask for my forgiveness? I do not forget. I do not forgive...\'

*Of course you don't.* Laughter burst through Harry's lips*.*

\'You find their betrayal funny, Harry?\' Voldemort\'s slitted pupils bored into him and he turned away. \'I suppose I might find the similarity amusing too, were I in your shoes.'

Harry cleared his thoughts of everything but the circle of dark on the white page.

Voldemort released a soft laugh. \'I will have my repayment from all of you. A second chance to prove you meant the words we spoke together when you took my mark. When you have fulfilled your debt to me, we will stand alongside each other once more and remake this country in our image.\' He moved back to the centre of the circle. \'Perhaps, though, some of you feel that Avery was right? That there *is* a reason to fear.

Dumbledore, that champion of the undeserving rabble, walks in your nightmares, or maybe you even fear *Harry Potter...*\'

A sinking feeling crept back into Harry's gut.

\'Bertha,\' Voldemort commanded. \'My wand.\'

\'Of course, my lord.\' She passed a long, pale wand to Voldemort.

'Is that all, master---'

Voldemort caught her by her severed wrist. \'You have never asked for repayment for the sacrifice you made to restore me to my body, such loyalty is admirable.\' A hand of shimmering steel spun from the end of his wand, attaching itself to the stump of Bertha\'s arm.

\'Thank you, my lord,\' she whispered, flexing her shining fingers.

'*Thank you*.'

\'Back you go, Bertha,\' Voldemort said. \'Your reward is not for your devotion, but for understanding that no follower of mine need ever beg what they deserve from me. Only those who suffered Azkaban rather than renounce me will be more exalted than you.\'

Malfoy's face twisted into a grimace as if he'd just choked down

an entire barrel of lemons.

\'Now.\' Voldemort turned back to Harry, spinning his ebony wand around his fingers just as he had spun Harry\'s holly wand in the chamber of secrets. \'I shall prove to you, my friends, that there is nothing to fear, not from Dumbledore, and not from his pawn.\'

A shard of ice formed in Harry\'s chest. *I'm nobody\'s pawn*

*anymore*.

Voldemort extended Harry\'s wand back to him, a cold smile on his face. \'Now, Harry, we duel, and you die, just as you would've done thirteen years ago had your mother\'s magic not interfered.\'

*I don\'t want to die.* The numbness clawed at Harry, seeping back into his heart like cold water overflowing from a drain. *I'm not going back to that. I refuse to disappear. I refuse to die. I refuse to lose.*

Voldemort stepped back to the circle edge. Harry mirrored him, his weight poised on the balls of his feet. Voldemort inclined his head, folding at the waist.

Harry reciprocated, throwing a glance at the glowing triwizard trophy. *Is it still a portkey? Will it take me back?*

\'Crucio,\' Voldemort whispered.

Harry threw himself to one side, then back when a second red curse hissed through the air. *I can survive. I can escape.*

His wand burst into warmth, the heat flooding up his arm. \'Osassula,\' he murmured, sending the curse at Voldemort.

He batted it aside. Harry unleashed a hail of them.

\'Such dark magic, Harry.\' Voldemort circled around the edge, swatting every bone-splintering curse and hex into the ground around him. \'What would that old fool Dumbledore say?\'

\'There's no such thing as dark or light,\' Harry quipped. 'There's---' 'Only power.\' A cold grin spread across Voldemort's lips. \'I did not

truly expect you to listen, Harry, when I told you that three years ago.\'

\'I *didn\'t* listen.\' Harry threw every spell he knew at Voldemort and steeled himself, dragging up the cold little ball of hate in his breast. \'There's only intent.'

Harry bathed the circle of Death Eaters in Fiendfyre. The cloaked figures scrambled out of the way as tombstones, grass, and even the cauldron were consumed. Voldemort's serpentine eyes studied him though the hungry, red flame, even as the Fiendfyre twisted back around his wand at Harry, swirling into a serpent\'s maw.

*Nope. I am not being killed by my own spell.* Harry\'s wand flared red at the tip and the Fiendfyre roiled down into the ground, billowing out of existence in a wave of searing heat.

\'Perhaps,\' Voldemort murmured. \'There was something to that prophecy after all.\'

*Prophecy?*

\'If you were anyone else, save that old fool Dumbledore, I would offer you a place within my inner circle, Harry.\' Voldemort gestured to the ring of Death Eaters reforming around them.

\'I\'m already within your inner circle.\' Harry pointed at them all with the tip of his wand.

\'Indeed you are.\' Voldemort's lips curled in amusement and the

pale wand flashed up.

The graveyard dissolved into a hail of curses.

Harry threw up his shield charm. It shattered like puddle ice beneath a boot. Tombstones disintegrated as the curses hissed past him and a red beam of light struck him in the stomach. Searing pain wracked his body, crashing over him, and he crumpled into a ball.

Voldemort lowered his wand and the pain faded. \'A taste of the pain I endured that night at Godric\'s Hollow, Harry.'

Harry rolled himself over and pushed himself to his feet.

\'Again, Harry?\' Voldemort stalked back and forth before him. \'For the pain I suffered at your hands when you killed my servant Quirrell, perhaps?\'

The yew wand came up. \'Papilionis,\' Harry muttered.

A swarm of butterflies curled out of the air, a handful veering out of the swirling demi-sphere. Voldemort\'s cruciatus curses burst into wisps of black smoke.

\'Avada Kedavra,\' Voldemort hissed.

Another wisp of black smoke drifted through the air between

them.

Harry flicked his wand, transfiguring a single butterfly into a steel

spike and sending it flying across the circle at Voldemort. He side-stepped and the steel fragment hissed past him.

A small gasp of pain echoed from behind Voldemort. Bertha Jorkins collapsed to her knees holding her neck. Bright, crimson blood spurted out past her shining, silver fingers as she blinked up at Voldemort.

\'Master,\' she pleaded. Great gouts of blood drenched the left side of her robes and spattered on the ground. The beret slipped off her head and flopped to the dirt. \'Master, *please*.\'

Voldemort's eyes never left Harry.

\'I told you,\' Harry said.

Bertha giggled, gasped, blinked and fell still.

*She\'s the third person I've killed.*

\'Now, you're no different from us, Harry.\' Voldemort glanced down at Bertha's corpse. 'Dumbledore would tell you you've stained your soul.'

Ice spread across his chest. The glowing red eyes of the boggart gleamed in memory and something stirred in the void beneath the cold. Ink black eyes rolled open and focused, their slits as slim and sharp as swords.

\'She's the third servant of yours I've killed, Voldemort.\' His wand snapped up, summoning the portkey cup to him. He caught the cold metal handle in his left hand.

'Why would we make it a two-way portkey, Harry?' Voldemort's mirth made his crimson eyes glow. 'Who did you think we were going to be sending back?'

\'Avada Kedavra.\'

Bright green light flashed from Harry's wand.

Voldemort apparated a few metres to his right with a soft snap and the killing curse spattered against one of the stubs of the tombstones.

*He apparated.* Harry froze. *Bertha's dead. She was the one who made the wards. She's dead. The wards are gone.*

\'So you do have the intent to kill,\' Voldemort hissed. \'Who then of my followers have you killed? For who else\'s sake shall I kill you?\'

Harry weighed his options and dragged what remained of his magic forth to the surface. \'Barty Crouch Junior and Peter Pettigrew.\' He threw a handful of bone-splintering curses at Voldemort.

\'Pettigrew, perhaps.\' Voldemort deflected Harry\'s curses with a shining silver shield composed of thousands of tiny serpents. \'He was a poor wizard, occasionally useful, but mostly pathetic. Barty, on the other hand, was talented. No fourteen year old could have beaten him in a duel, even after the time he spent in Azkaban. How do you claim to?\'

\'Like this.\' Harry slashed his wand across his chest toward Voldemort.

A hazy basilisk maw shimmered through the air and slammed into Voldemort\'s shield. It shattered like glass, sending him staggering backward and down to his knees.

*Time to go.* Harry clawed the rest of his magic out and seized hold of the first place he thought of. Silver hair and blue eyes danced before the eye of his mind.

\'Legilimens,\' Voldemort spat as Harry *twisted.*

Voldemort's thoughts crashed into his own, tearing the intent and emotion of the spell he'd cast from him. Harry struggled for the circle of dark ink, but Voldemort latched onto the feeling of the basilisk spell and followed it like a piece of rope. Eleven hollow years of empty memories

with the Dursleys flashed before Harry's eyes. With them came an orphanage filled with sneering children and disdainful peers who abhorred the hated world he'd left behind.

*I was nothing once, too.* A smooth, high voice welled up amongst his thoughts.

Silver flashed before Harry's eyes and he smashed into something so hard the world swirled to a halt, bursting into darkness with an explosion of bright, white sparks.

# Summertime Sadness

Brown faux-brick tiles spread along the walls from Harry's hip. Smudged cream-painted plaster stretched up to a stark-white, cobweb- dusted ceiling.

*It looks like some kitchen from Aunt Petunia's childhood.*

He followed his tiles, drawn by a strange echo of familiarity. The chipped tile. The one with the bubble. The almost-orange tile. The missing half-tile. Harry turned left through door number seven.

A small, worn bag hung from the scratched, rusted metal frame of the small bed wedged into the corner. A line of chalk nicks marked the window sill. Harry brushed the last of them away with his thumb. 'Today's the day,' he murmured. His voice came out high, but cracked, like those silent days when Dudley was away with friends, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon forgot he existed.

Harry plucked the bag off the bed and started into the grimy window. He tugged at the collar of his blurred, faint reflection and swept his hair to the side.

'Don't dawdle.' He pulled the door shut, then straightened the number seven on it back up. 'She's probably waiting.'

Harry paced the order of the tiles back toward the door. *Who's waiting?* The brick-like tiles drifted past as he turned through corridors, breezing past the fleeting shadows of children. *Aunt Petunia?*

Pigeons strode the empty street beyond the iron gate. Stray newspaper pages stuck in the gutter, their pages fluttering.

Harry ground to a halt. A thick knot twisted in his gut. 'Did she not want to come?'

A slim figure turned the corner at the end of the street. Sunlight flashed off thick, metal-framed glasses.

*There she is.*

A shimmering silver dress and hair shone as she strode down the hill. Her blue eyes and small, warm smile floated before the eye of Harry's mind and his heart leapt into his mouth.

A loud step came from behind him. 'Go on, Tom. Don't keep a lady waiting, lad.'

Harry's eyes snapped open. Clean, white wool hovered in front of him infused with the faint, citrus scent of hospital ward laundry. His heart's pounding faded back to a gentle beat.

*Legilimency's a double-edged sword, even for a master.* He took a deep breath and tried to picture room seven, but the brick-like tiles and ivory plaster had vanished.

\'Mr Potter.\' Madam Pomfrey's heels clicked, ringing louder as she approached. 'I heard you wake up, Mr Potter. You may as well pull the sheet back down off your head.'

\'I\'m awake.\' Harry tugged the sheet down and caught sight of the

steaming goblet in her hand. 'And perfectly fine.'

\'You are *not* perfectly fine, Mr Potter,\' she snapped, placing the goblet next to his bed. \'I am going to permanently label this bed as yours for next year.\'

\'I feel fine?\' Harry eyed the thick, chalky-looking liquid steaming in

the goblet. 'Maybe a little sore?'

\'You are the second student I have had in this wing in the last week suffering from the effects of the Cruciatus Curse.' Madam Pomfrey caught him looking at the goblet. \'And *yes*, you will be drinking that down to the last drop!\'

*Fleur.* Harry glanced down the length of the ward, but the curtains were all drawn back against the walls and the beds covered in neat-folded sheets and pillows. *I'm the only one here\...*

\'What\'s it for?\' He sniffed the steam coming off the potion,

wincing and coughing. 'Even the *smell* is awful.'

Madam Pomfrey sighed and crossed her arms. \'It\'s everything your body needed the last week it spent sleeping off the effects of bouncing off the anti-apparition wands.'

\'Will it taste as bad as it looks?\' Harry asked.

Her eyes glinted. He grabbed the goblet and gulped it down. Something like burning liquorice coated the inside of Harry's throat and mouth and the fierce fumes stung his nose.

\'Yes.' Madam Pomfrey pulled her wand from her uniform pocket and traced it over his torso. 'I imagine that it *will* taste quite bad.'

'Am I okay?'

\'You actually do seem to be perfectly fine, Mr Potter.\' Madam Pomfrey frowned. 'Which has come a week or so sooner than I'd've expected, but save for another scar, you\'ve come away unscathed.\' She handed him a miniature mirror.

A small triangular nick marked the edge of his cheekbone.

\'I couldn\'t get rid of the deepest part of the cut,\' Madam Pomfrey said. \'Whatever they used had some enchantment to seal the wound up. I wasn't able to fully undo the effects.\'

\'It\'s barely noticeable.\' Harry shrugged. 'It's not exactly going to distract anyone from my *other* scar.' He handed the mirror back to her. \'I --- er --- I don\'t suppose you\'d tell me what\'s happened since the tournament ended?\'

\'You won,\' Madam Pomfrey said. \'It was a bit of a mess after Ludo Bagman\'s involvement came to light, but you did apparate into the wards while holding the trophy. Not that we've mentioned your *illegal* apparition to anyone, of course.\'

\' Ludo Bagman?\' Harry kept his tone even.

\'He was the one who put your name in. The whole tournament was rigged so you\'d get there first and disappear off to You-Know-Who. He confessed to everything immediately once the Imperius Curse was lifted and spouted the whole story to the headmaster and the minister.\'

\'Where is he?\'

\'The minister carted him off to Azkaban immediately.\' Madam Pomfrey shook her head. \'No trial, no nothing, just *gone*. And all for things done under the Imperius Curse! If that was the done thing, half of British wizarding society would be there after the last war.\'

*Azkaban's a bit much, even if he did help get Fleur tortured and Viktor killed, it wasn't really him doing it.* Harry felt a small flicker of pity for Ludo Bagman. *No doubt Lucius Malfoy was advising Fudge.*

\'He took the blame, then?\' Harry asked. 'What about the other

champions?'

\'He took the blame for *everything*, Mr Potter.\' Madam Pomfrey sniffed and plucked the goblet from Harry's bedside. \'The minister didn\'t seem very interested in his version of events at all, even when it was obvious he had been under the Imperius Curse. At least the students know what happened. Dumbledore announced everything at the end of the year feast.\'

Harry blinked. *The end of year feast?*

\'Exactly what *is* the date, Madam Pomfrey?\'

\'Oh.\' She pressed her fingertips to her lips. \'I'm sorry, Mr Potter. It\'s the second of July, everyone has gone home except for the permanent staff and yourself. You should write to Mr Longbottom and Miss Bell, they were often in here to see you over the last week and will be grateful to know you've recovered.\'

*They didn't just forget me when I disappeared.* Harry felt a rush of affection for the pair. *Wait.* His heart plummeted. *Everyone...*

'What about the other schools?' he murmured.

\'They\'ve gone back to their own institutions and have probably gone home from there.\' Madam Pomfrey strode into her office.

*She went back to France.* A cold sick feeling bubbled up in his stomach. *And she didn't come to visit me, either. Of course.*

\'Are you ok, Mr Potter?\' Madam Pomfrey poked her head back out

of her office. 'You're looking a little pale.' \'I\'m perfectly fine.'

\'If you insist.\' She sighed. \'The headmaster wants to speak with you before you leave, he\'s probably on his way down to the ward now. He always seems to know when people wake up.\'

Harry swung himself out of bed and pulled on the rather loose, worn robes he'd been provided, transfiguring them into something a bit better fitting. *I suppose it's my own fault for leaving everything in the chamber.* He stared into the window, straightened the collar of his robes and swept his hair off his face.

'Harry.\' Dumbledore strode through the doors into the hospital

wing. \'Are you feeling well?\'

\'Yes,\' Harry lied.

Something fluttered among his thoughts when he met the headmaster\'s bright blue eyes. He dragged the image of the circle of dark ink before his mind's eye and raised his wand.

\'Ah.\' A little guilt flickered through Dumbledore's eyes. 'You've been learning the Mind Arts. I apologise, Harry, occasionally I feel it's worthwhile for me to take a peek using passive legilimency. Reprehensible, I know, but sometimes necessary for the greater good.\'

Harry buried his distaste at the idea Dumbledore had been picking

through his thoughts for the first few years. 'How does it work?\'

*Voldemort tore out most of my childhood and shared a good deal*

*of his in just the instant before I apparated. That can't happen again.*

\'It\'s a complicated and obscure branch of magic, one Tom has mastered. It allows a wizard to create a connection to the mind of another and, from there, experience his thoughts, feelings, and memories. Passive legilimency does little more than skim the surface and let me glimpse very strong reactions or thoughts, Harry, it's as much as I feel comfortable using with students even for a greater good. A more active approach would allow me to follow those thoughts and feelings as far back as they run and even create visions of my own in your head.\'

\'I think I'd like to learn to defend myself against it,\' Harry said.

\'It is often a good idea, especially for you, Harry, whom Tom has taken a keen interest in. The easiest way to defeat it is to break eye contact with the caster, all but the most skilled practitioners require eye contact to maintain the magic and it is far easier to do with it.\'

*That's how I broke the connection*. *I apparated away.*

\'I can point you in the direction of some good books on the subject, Harry, but first I must press you on what happened after you touched the cup and were whisked away. Ludo Bagman, who altered the portkey, knew only that he was sending you to Little Hangleton, presumably to Tom, and that the Dark Lord would be returning on the night.\' Dumbledore ushered Harry out of the door and into the corridor, beginning the route towards his office.

\'He's back,\' Harry said. \'There was a ritual in the graveyard using my blood. He has a body now.\'

\'What else do you remember, Harry?\' Dumbledore's blue eyes

were sharp as a rapier.

Harry focused on the circle of dark ink on its white page. \'He was angry with the Death Eaters. We duelled.\' Harry dragged his words out, scrambling for a safe version of events. \'Bertha Jorkins was the one who Imperiused Bagman. She killed Crouch when he found Pettigrew and Pettigrew for getting caught and risking his master. We can\'t prove Sirius\' innocence now, can we?\'

*I\'m sorry, Sirius*. *We'll find another way. I needed to be free.*

\'I\'m afraid not, Harry.\' Dumbledore shook his head. \'That does explain the body that was found on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, though I suspect Cornelius will not accept its true identity.\'

\'There was more.\' Harry feigned embarrassment and stared at his shoes to hide a small smile. \'Voldemort beat me, he was way too strong. I only just managed to apparate away when the wards trapping me failed.\'

\'Surviving a duel with Tom is something to be proud of, Harry,\' Dumbledore murmured. \'At your age, you should not have even had a chance. Did something inexplicable happen that allowed you to escape?\'

\'No. He apparated to dodge my spell, so I tried to apparate back here and succeeded.' Harry grinned. 'Sort of. Madam Pomfrey mentioned bouncing... *Should* something inexplicable have happened?\'

\'As I\'m sure you remember, your first wand shared a brother core with Tom's. It is possible for that to cause an extraordinary effect known as priori incantatem.\' Dumbledore paused before the gargoyle. \'Sugar quills, old friend.'

The gargoyle stepped aside.

'My new wand must be too different,' Harry said.

'I suspect so.' Dumbledore strode up the steps with a bounce in his stride. 'It's a good thing, I think. Tom would've been displeased in the failure of his wand and likely gone seeking another. There are few wandmakers of great stature these days, Harry, losing any of them would be an awful blow to the country and, indeed, the wider world.'

\'What happens now, headmaster?\' Harry asked.

\'I believe, Harry, that Tom will seek to keep his return a secret while he regains strength. I will do everything I can to expose him, but there's nothing you can or should be doing at your age to stop him. In a few years, perhaps, but not yet.\'

*A few years.* Harry fixed his smile in place. *As if you plan to let me live that long.*

Dumbledore took a seat behind his desk and proffered a small bowl of bright, striped sweets. \'Take a seat, Harry, and help yourself to a humbug, if you want. I find they help me think.\'

\'I\'m okay thanks.\' Harry wrinkled his nose at the bowl. 'I'm not really one for sweets. Cake perhaps, but not sweets. My cousin serves as a pretty *sizeable* warning about how good they are for you.'

'All things are best in moderation.' Dumbledore set the bowl aside and pushed a bag in front of Harry. \'Your winnings, Harry, from the Triwizard Tournament. You did, despite everything, manage to return with the cup.\'

*I won.* A soft hollow feeling crept upon him. *But nobody cares that*

*I won, only that they didn't win. Guess the boggart had a point after all.*

\'I do have a few questions for you, Harry.\' Dumbledore adjusted his half-moon spectacles and leant forward.

\'Of course, professor.\' Harry kept his face calm and still, even as his heart began to race.

\'What happened within the maze, Harry?\'

'Viktor was killed,\' Harry murmured. \'I came across the end of the

fight.\'

\'You stunned, Mr Diggory,\' Dumbledore said. 'And broke his wand,

I assume?'

*He knows.* Harry snuck a long, deep breath in. *How does he know? Did he see the Fiendfyre, too?*

\'I obliviated Cedric. He was under the imperius, too. I'm glad I did, given what I heard happened to Ludo Bagman.'

\'That was very noble of you, Harry.\' Dumbledore smiled. \'Mr Diggory is distraught over what has happened, but given the position Cornelius has taken and your risky act, he will never suspect the part he played or have to bear the guilt. I\'m very proud of you.\'

\'Thank you,' Harry muttered.

\'It may leave you in a very tenuous position, though, Harry.\' Dumbledore steepled his fingers. 'You're the only living, loyal wizard who can claim to have seen Tom in the flesh since that tragic night all those years ago. There will be those at the ministry who seek to taint your reputation to discredit you and Viktor Krum's mysterious death will be an opportunity for them.\'

\'I know, professor.\' Harry offered him a faint smile. \'But my friends would never believe that, and I don't care too much about anyone's opinion if they take Rita Skeeter seriously.\'

\'That may be very wise of you, my boy.' Dumbledore bounced his fingertips together. \'I doubt the ministry will put you on trial without any evidence. It will only give you a platform from which they'll fear you speak about Tom.' He paused and lowered his hands to the desk. 'And now, Harry, I'm afraid I must ask you what Tom said to you in the graveyard.\'

\'He didn\'t really speak to me much,\' Harry lied. \'Just some insults and the Cruciatus Curse, really.\'

\'I see.\' The lines on Dumbledore's face turned deep and old. \'I\'m very sorry, Harry. I don\'t seem to be able to keep you from harm for a single year, do I?\'

\'I\'m sure you aren\'t to blame, sir.' A little ice slipped into Harry's

tone despite his best efforts.

Dumbledore winced. \'I have only one more thing I need you to speak about before I can let you apparate home, though I must ask you to

refrain from using your excellent ability except when in the direst need. It is still illegal, if harmless, but Tom's supporters in the ministry will be waiting for any excuse they can get.\'

Harry weighed his words with great care. \'I will only use it when I have no other choice, professor.\'

\'Thank you, Harry. I appreciate that it must be a bit of a blow for you. I\'m sure you\'re dying to be able to use your magic whenever you can.' Dumbledore cracked a wide smile. 'Why, when I was young, I used to use my magic at every chance I got for the silliest of things.\'

\'What did you want to ask me about?\'

*It won't be horcruxes. It won't be that prophecy Voldemort mentioned. And it won't be how, in the back of your head, I'm already dead.*

Dumbledore's expression shifted into something grim and his blue eyes fixed themselves on a point just behind the back of Harry's head. \'We found Miss Delacour quite a long way from where she remembered falling unconscious when we apprehended Ludo Bagman. It was very lucky that we stopped him, since if he had touched her like he intended, he would've suffered quite a horrible fate.\'

*Good.* The shred of pity he'd felt evaporated. *If he tried to hurt her,*

*he'd've deserved it.*

Harry pictured the circle of dark ink on the white page and met Dumbledore's stare. \'I carried Fleur out of harm\'s way. It was either her or Cedric. I figured he was needed alive to take the blame, but Fleur wasn't. I had to make sure she was safe.\'

\'That does not, Harry, excuse the use of such a horrible piece of magic. That was a particularly dark curse you used.\' Disappointment seeped from Dumbledore's expression. 'There are any number of ways you might've warded her that wouldn't have harmed Ludo.'

'But it was the only one I was sure would work, professor.' Harry studied the floor between his feet. 'It wouldn't have done anything to anyone not intending harm. I didn't think any other wards would last long if they didn't do something to whomever tripped them.'

\'I understand, Harry.\' Dumbledore sighed and leant back on his chair. \'Far worse things have and will be done for a greater good. Try not to let it burden your conscience, nobody came to harm, but please, don't use that curse again.\'

*Worse things like raising a child to die. Or trying to arrange his death every year from the age of eleven.*

\'I won\'t, sir.'

\'I\'ll let you go back to your home, Harry,\' Dumbledore said. \'Professor McGonagall and the house elves were unable to locate your things, so I\'d remind you not to forget anything and collect your trunk from wherever you've hidden it before you leave.\'

\'Thank you, sir.\' Harry picked up his bag of galleons and rested it on his hip. \'I hope you have a good summer.\' He leapt down the spiral stairs and out past the gargoyle, taking off in the direction of the Chamber of Secrets under his disillusionment charm.

*Salazar's going to be rather cross. He probably thinks I got eaten*

*by something.*

\'Oh! You *are* alive. Thank you, sole remaining family member, for being so considerate as to visit and let me know.\' Salazar's tone dripped sarcasm. 'I do appreciate your consideration.'

Harry grinned. \'I was sleeping off my encounter with Voldemort, you huge piece of desk graffiti.'

\'What happened?\' Salazar demanded.

\'The third task was going to plan. I used Fiendfyre once I was far enough into the maze to be unseen and nobody seems to suspect me for the razing of the hedges, but the other champions were taken out by one of Voldemort's servants so I could get to the cup and be abducted. Voldemort was also responsible for my name ending up in the goblet. His followers arranged events so that I ended up with him, using the trophy as a portkey, and he resurrected himself using my blood before I escaped.\'

\'Your blood?\' Salazar's eyes sharpened. 'That's unlikely to be

good.'

'I received a very similar impression at the time,' Harry muttered. 'Don't mumble, brat,' Salazar snapped, tapping his wand against

his chin. 'The protection of your mother's sacrifice is not lost to you. Magic like that can't be erased. It's possible that this has formed a bond of sorts between you. He cannot undo the blood magic your parents used, but he has stolen its protection for himself by using your blood as his own. He's protected just as you were, though I'm unsure of the specifics. He may be protected from your actions or from the results of his own against you. I do not know.\'

'There's some prophecy, too. Voldemort mentioned it.'

\'You must find it and learn what it says,\' Salazar ordered. \'If Voldemort knows what it is, then that may dictate every action he takes against you. We can\'t afford to be left in the dark.\'

\'I know nothing about it.\' Harry shrugged. \'Only that it exists and mentions me.\'

\'Find out about it,\' Salazar snapped. *\'Someone* must know something. A prophecy cannot be made without a witness.\'

\'I\'ll search as soon as I can, but I\'ll be out of contact with the wizarding world until term starts after summer.\'

\'Why?\' Salazar stared at him. 'What could you possibly be doing for that long? Some kind of crusade?'

Harry grimaced. \'That\'s how it is *every* summer. I can apparate here, but going anywhere else will attract suspicion and I don\'t really want to be attracting any adverse attention with Voldemort back.\'

*Dumbledore was right about that much.*

\'So you can\'t even use magic for the summer.' Salazar threw his hands up in the air, hurling his serpent to the floor. \'This is why I wanted the school to take on muggle-born students full time, they get left behind and cut out of the world they rightfully should be part of by their own families.\' Salazar's wand fountained silver sparks. 'But oh no, *Godric the Righteous* couldn't separate *families.* That wasn't *right*. Much better to let them go home and be burnt or ostracised.'

'Like Tom.' A brief flash of brown tiles passed before Harry's eyes.

*Don't keep a lady waiting, lad.* He shuddered. *I imagine that little love story ended about as well Romeo and Juliet.* He scowled. *Or me and Fleur.*

\'Did you still win?\' Salazar asked. 'You're scowling like you lost.' \'I didn't lose.\'

\'Then at least you have proved that girl from the other school wrong.\' Salazar gathered his snake up and arranged it round his shoulders. \'I hope you went to speak to her.\'

\'She went back to France before I woke up.' Harry studied the bookshelves on either side of the door. 'I should probably go back to Privet Drive.'

\'I take it that means you're about to leave?\'

\'Yes, my aunt and uncle have probably got their hopes up that I've died, so I should probably put an appearance in before they burn all my things.' Harry grinned. 'They're going to be so *disappointed* when I apparate in.'

*And furious.* His grin spread a little wider. *It's going to be*

*fantastic.*

Salazar's green eyes softened. \'If it becomes unbearable, you can just return here through the chamber.'

\'This is going to be the best summer yet. I have to catch up on everything I missed in my classes because of the tournament and Ollivander was kind enough not to apply the trace that prevents me from using magic in the summer without being detected.\'

Salazar's laugh had a touch of ice to it. \'I hope your muggle relatives realise how different things are going to be because of that.\'

Harry smirked. \'I think they\'ll come to realise it soon enough.'

\'Now?\' Salazar asked. \'What about your things?\'

\'I only need my wand. Hedwig can find her own way to me, she\'s a smart owl, and I have every book I could need in here. I\'ll just apparate back when I need something.\'

\'It\'s a long way to apparate just for a book,\' Salazar chided with a soft gleam in his eye. \'You might splinch yourself again.\'

Harry shrugged. 'It'll be good practice for me. And someone has to come back and make sure you've not tried to kill that snake.'

Salazar locked eyes with the reptile. 'I *can't* kill it. I *have* tried.' The snake stuck its tongue out, tickling Salazar's nose. 'Irritating creature.' He

turned back to Harry. 'Just remember you're cleaning up that giant mess you made on your first visit sometime soon.'

\'I didn't make a mess!'

'Tell that to the seventy foot corpse you've left here all these years,' Salazar muttered. 'Fiendfyre will get rid of it. Now, get out. I want to take a nap.'

Harry rolled his eyes, pictured the Dursley\'s back garden, and twisted the world back past him. A loud shriek of surprise rang in his ears and something glass smashed on the small patio.

\'Hello, Aunt Petunia.\' Harry grinned and gave them a cheerful

wave. \'Hello, Uncle Vernon, Dudley... I\'m *back*.\'

Uncle Vernon's face shifted through every shade of red known to

man, then moved onto purple.

Harry's grin widened. *I\'m going to enjoy this.*

\'Where have you been, boy?!\' Vernon's bellow echoed across the

garden.

*down!'*

\'The neighbours, Vernon,\' Aunt Petunia hissed. 'Keep your voice

Vernon swallowed and turned an odd shade of puce. \'And how

dare you appear like that.\'

\'I was in hospital.' Harry let a little chill creep into his voice. 'I appreciated all your visits and kind words, by the way.' He pressed his hand over his heart. 'They touched me right here.'

\'Don\'t take that tone with me!\' Vernon staggered to his feet. \'You can\'t do anything freakish now, boy! Go to your room and change into normal clothes and then we\'ll talk about your behaviour! I won\'t tolerate---\'

Harry pressed the tip of his wand into Vernon's jowled cheek just below his right eye. A bright, cold, green light flickered about the slim piece of ebony. \'Oh, please do carry on, uncle. Don\'t let me interrupt you. You were saying something about intolerable behaviour, I think?\'

Aunt Petunia went still as stone, her mouth gaping like a goldfish.

Half a sandwich flopped out of Dudley's mouth. A strangled whimper emanated from somewhere under Uncle Vernon's moustache and he gulped.

\'I shall assume you've finished, then,\' Harry said. \'Now, if an underage wizard performs illegal magic, a letter arrives to inform them what they\'ve done and what will happen next. Observe.\'

He transfigured the rest of Dudley\'s sandwich into a cobra. Aunt Petunia and Dudley screamed and scrambled off the patio onto the lawn as the Egyptian cobra flared its hood and hissed at them. Harry spread his hands, pointing at the skies.

Several minutes crawled past as the snake made a mess of the table, scattering the neat triangular sandwiches and spilling the salad slathered with Aunt Petunia's famous homemade coleslaw.

Harry grinned. \'Oh look! *No letter\...* '

Vernon turned white as a sheet.

Harry banished the snake. \'I\'m going to my room to change, please remember that demonstration for the future.\' He let the ice creep into his eyes and voice. \'I\'d hate to have to make this point a second time. Cobras are rather venomous, something might go terribly wrong...\'

He strode inside and upstairs, pulled open his wardrobe, and transfigured the first pair of Dudley's cast offs. *There, now they look like something a human being might choose to wear.*

Hedwig perched on his desk. A folded, manila envelope lay beneath her talons.

*Fuck.* Harry's blood froze. *Did Ollivander lie to me?*

He took a deep breath and crushed the cold fear. 'No. Hedwig wouldn't deliver warnings from the ministry. They have their own owls.'

Harry unfolded the envelope. A single line of writing captioned an animated pencil sketch. A willow tree leant over a bend in the rippling river, its branches caught in a slight breeze.

*Eleven o\'clock on the day you receive this, or the first afterward.* Harry re-read the caption. *The word is argent.* He swallowed. *That sounds French, even in my head.* He flipped over the picture, but it was blank.

*Fleur?* He wrestled with his hope, but it refused to be smothered.

'Or Voldemort's decided to adopt a green agenda and changed the Dark Mark into a tree, I suppose.' Harry folded the letter back up. 'It's probably a trap.'

An odd yearning bubbled up in his chest as Fleur's face swam through his thoughts. *And yet, I'm probably going*. Harry sighed. *She definitely did something to me with her allure. Definitely.*

He tapped the envelope against his palm and cast a quick tempus. 'Well, go on. Don't keep a lady waiting, Harry.' He took a deep breath. \'Argent.\'

The walls of Harry's bedroom remained in place.

\'*Argent*.\' Harry put a little more effort into the French accent.

A soft jolt pushed him against something warm and rough. The leaves of a willow tree cascaded down around him and the river bend rippled over small pebbles at his feet.

*So far, so good.* Harry tucked the envelope into his pocket and kept his wand ready.

\'You are early.\' A soft, French-accented voice drifted down from

above.

Harry's heart lurched. *Definitely Fleur.*

A quiet thud reverberated behind him.

\'I said eleven.\' Her voice came over his shoulder. \'You are lucky I

come here often, else you would have had to wait.\'

\'I think I could've survived. It's a beautiful spot.\' Harry forced his

head to turn as she stepped round the trunk.

Fleur\'s bright, blue eyes pierced through him. \'You owe me an explanation, Harry Potter. I did not burn all those hedges, I did not walk myself all the way to the centre of the maze, and I *certainly* did not place a curse capable of killing anyone who tried to touch me intending harm on myself.\'

The tree-trunk pressed against Harry's back; its bark dug into his shoulders. 'That may have been me. I didn\'t like the idea of leaving you for whichever of Voldemort\'s followers was lurking around.\'

\'So you carried me all the way across the maze to the wards instead?\' Fleur\'s eyes sparkled and she took a step closer. \'Gabby has a theory as to why you might have carried me all that way instead of simply sending up red sparks as you must have done for Cedric Diggory.\'

Harry gulped. His stomach knotted itself, then coiled into a tight, hot ball for good measure. *Maybe it would've been better if it had been Voldemort lying in wait for me. At least I know he's just going to try and kill me.*

\'Is it an interesting theory?\' His voice cracked.

Something almost predatory gleamed in Fleur's blue eyes. \'I think I would very much like to know if she is right.\' She placed a hand either side of him on the willow's trunk. 'So why *did* you?'

The words nearly tumbled from his tongue. *Her magic.* Harry dragged his circle of dark ink into the midst of his thoughts. *Don't let her win.*

\'You made a portkey.\' He let the ink blot swell and swallow the memories of the last time she'd been so close to him, let the feelings fade into stark, dark ink and pale parchment.

\'They are easy to make.\' Fleur shrugged and tilted her chin into the air. \'It will take you back, but that requires a different word to the one that brought you here.\'

\'You\'ve trapped me.\' Harry laughed. \'I did think it might be a trap,

but I didn't really expect to be trapped by *you*.\'

\'I will give you the word once you answer my questions,\' Fleur

said.

'Questions? I thought there was only one?'

'You are avoiding it.' The small, warm smile crept onto Fleur's lips.

'So I thought we might as well start with the easy ones and work our way

up to it.'

Harry swallowed hard and wiped the sweat off his palms onto his jeans. His pulse raced and his heart hammered against his ribs. 'Sounds like a good idea, I suppose.'

\'Why did you not try to speak to me after the Yule Ball?\'

\'*You* avoided *me*.' Harry drew himself up. 'You used your magic on me, kissed me, then refused to speak to me for almost two months. I thought you wanted to be my *friend*, but you just wanted to know how to *beat* me.\'

A small flicker of emotion passed through Fleur's eyes. 'It was not my magic.'

A touch of ice tightened in Harry's chest. \'Yes it *was.* After the Yule Ball in the Room of Requirement, when you wanted to test my resistance. I *felt* it, Fleur.\'

\'You called me beautiful.\' Fleur's lips drew a little closer to his. Her eyes shone with mirth just a finger's length from his. 'I remember.'

*Why do I get the feeling she knows something I don't?* Harry tried to take a deep breath, got a mouthful of sweet, sharp marzipan and burnt holly, and closed his lips and held his breath.

\'You used your charm on me,\' he said. \'It worked, then you kissed me and left.\'

\'I had drunk more wine than I should have. I was feeling reckless and I had never kissed anyone before.' Her smile never wavered. 'I could not use my magic to make you think I was beautiful, Harry, not even if I tried. It's a compulsion to impress, to desire, to want, nothing more.\'

*I didn't feel any sudden compulsion to impress you.*

Harry saw the next question looming in Fleur's eyes. \'Why did you

avoid me?\' he blurted.

\'I had a lot of things to think about. Most of them were to do with you.\' A hint of a pout touched her lips. 'You are very difficult. You do not chase after me like all the other boys. Not even when I *wanted* you to chase after me so you would actually speak to me.'

'Sorry.\' Harry wrestled with the knot in his chest, shoving it down before it strangled him. 'I thought you just wanted to win. I thought what I feel was because of your magic.

'What *do* you feel?\' Fleur leant closer. Her silver hair cascaded over her blue irises like shimmering silk; it spilt over Harry's collarbone, tickling his skin, and the scent of sharp, sweet marzipan drifted to his nose from it.

The air disappeared. Words went with it, evaporating off his tongue every time he tried to say something.

\'I will not give you the word to go back until you answer.\' Fleur's

voice trembled.

*And I don't have an answer.* He clutched for one, but it vanished on his lips and stuck in his throat. *I don't know any words to describe it.*

The bright glint in Fleur's eyes began to fade, tears welling up in its place. She drew back a fraction. Harry wrapped an arm around her waist and pulled her across the gap between them. The heat of her warmed his skin like summer sunshine.

\'Is that your answer?\' she whispered, brushing her hair from between their faces. Her hands slipped to his shoulders.

Harry shook his head. \'No.'

*Just do it.* He buried the knot in his stomach. *She did it. You can do it.* Harry leant forward.

Fleur's lips curved into a smile, her hands sweeping up into his hair as she crushed herself against him. Every curve of her body pushed into his, pressing his back into the tree, and the tip of her tongue left a sweet tang along his upper lip.

His lungs ached. 'I -- er -- I need to breathe.'

Fleur's laughter sent his heart lurching again. \'That was a good

answer,\' she murmured.

'Was Gabby right?\'

Fleur managed half a scowl before her smile slid back onto her face. \'She will not let me ever forget it.\'

\'Good,\' Harry said. \'I don\'t want you to.\'

She kissed him again, nipping his lower lip with her teeth. \'You are not getting the word for the portkey, not until I am satisfied.\'

The bottom dropped out of Harry's stomach. \'What happened to me only being fourteen?'

\'Almost fifteen.\' Fleur laughed and kissed him again. \'It does not matter, I stopped thinking about your age a while ago, but this is not where we are having our first time. It looks uncomfortable.\' She cocked her head. 'I am not sure I want to rush into that anyway.'

*Right*. Harry's eyes slid down Fleur's neck. A whole host of

images flitted through his mind. *Not a single seashell bra to be seen.*

Fleur arched an eyebrow. 'You know, normally, I do not like the boys all staring, but yours feels rather good.'

Harry dragged his eyes back up to her face. 'Sorry.'

'Do not be.' She rested her cheek against his. 'You are different to

them.'

Harry kissed her forehead and leant his head back against the tree

trunk. \'How is this going to work? You'll be in France. I'll be in Britain.\'

Voldemort's crimson eyes, Dumbledore's blue ones, horcruxes, prophecies,

and Death Eaters flooded through his head.

*I wish all of that could just disappear.* He swallowed a brief, bitter moment of heat. *Wishes like that just don't come true.*

\'You can come visit me,\' Fleur murmured into his neck. Her eyes were closed. \'Use the portkey. I will make one for myself and then we can both come here, whenever we can.\'

\'For the rest of our lives?\' Harry asked.

A slight pout curved her lips. \'Until we think of something better. Or maybe I will just not tell you the word to send you back to Britain and keep you here with me. Gabby would like that, she would find it very romantic.\'

\'You\'d kidnap the Boy-Who-Lived?\' Harry asked.

\'Nobody would ever look for you here in France. If you wanted, you could disappear and stay with me.\' Fleur opened her eyes. 'But it's okay. It is just wishful thinking. I know you cannot.'

\'I have to finish school and that\'s the *least* of my worries.\' \'Voldemort,\' Fleur muttered. \'We heard the rumours, even if your

ministry denies them.\'

\'I'll make a plan.\' He kissed her cheek and grinned. \'He\'ll be defeated, I\'ll get wonderful exam results, win the house cup, and be in complete control of my life for the first time.\'

*There's no plan.* Harry smoothed out his thoughts. *Just Fleur. And a prophecy, some horcruxes, Dumbledore, the Ministry, Voldemort, and whatever else tries to get in our way.*

\'I will help,' Fleur declared. \'I have only six more months at Beauxbatons left if my exams go well, then I am applying for a job with Les Inconnus. It will not be easy to get in, it takes years sometimes, but, hopefully, I will be able to work with the most complicated enchanted things in existence. Other things do not interest me yet and my family is wealthy enough. In the meantime, I shall help you however I can, and you will come and visit me.\'

'How---'

Fleur placed her finger on his lips and shook her head. 'Non.'

*It's not the time to worry, I suppose.* Harry kissed her fingertip and let the French sun and Fleur's warmth soak into him. *I freed myself for this. I mustn't waste it. Or lose it.*

# The Game is Afoot

Harry padded down the carpeted stairs of Privet Drive over the top of his first room and drifted into the kitchen.

\'Doesn\'t your school start today,\' Vernon grumbled, putting his paper down beside his plate.

\'Yes, it does.\' Harry stole Dudley\'s bacon in passing.

Dudley squealed and looked at his parents. They both gave him a small shake of the head.

\'That\'s very good bacon,\' Harry said.

Petunia's pursed lips twitched.

*Perhaps I remind her of her sister more.* Harry yawned and finished off the other half. *Too late to remember I'm family now, Petunia.*

\'Why're you still here, then?\' Dudley demanded. 'To make sure you eat your grapefruit, Duddikins.'

Dudley scowled and chomped on a spoonful of pink fruit.

\'The train leaves London at eleven and it\'s already nearly

ten,' Petunia murmured.

Harry raised an eyebrow. She twisted around and busied herself with the dishes in the sink.

He turned back to Dudley. \'You remember how I can apparate at will.\'

Dudley nodded and shot a sideways look at his father.

Veron stared into an advert for solar panels with far more attention

than Harry'd ever seen him give anything but the business section.

*Or page three of the Sun, when he thinks nobody's looking.*

\'I can do that to get to school, but the other students can\'t, so I don\'t need to get the train like them.\' Harry ran some numbers through his head. 'I'll be off soon, though.'

\'Oh.\' Dudley screwed his face up into the *that\'s-kind-of-cool*

expression he normally reserved for the TV. 'Makes sense.'

\'So, when *are* you leaving, boy?\' Vernon lowered his paper to fix Harry with his small, piggish eyes. 'We have things planned. Can't be waiting 'round all day here for you.'

Harry grinned. \'Now.' He apparated up onto the landing

with a loud crack.

\'This can\'t continue, Pet.\' Vernon\'s voice drifted up from the kitchen. \'He just does whatever he wants!\'

\'What do you think we\'re going to be able to *do*, Vernon?\' Aunt Petunia's voice held a terse note. \'We've talked about this several times *already*.\'

A strangled whimper escaped Uncle Vernon.

Aunt Petunia sighed. \'He\'ll leave like Lily did in a few years and then it will just be us and our son, how we always dreamt it would be.\'

*Still hoping I'll vanish*. *Well I won't.*

Harry tugged Fleur's picture out from under his mattress.

\'Argent.\'

He opened his eyes into bright sunlight. It lanced through the gaps in the dome of willow branches, glimmering back off the water and the smooth, round, white pebbles of the shore. He took a moment to breathe it in: the sound of the water, the rustling of the willow leaves, the warmth scattered in bright bars of light across his back, the smell of grass, hot stone, and sweet, sharp marzipan.

Fleur reclined on her branch, her bare legs and feet dangling down to his shoulders. Harry's heart squirmed at the small smile on her lips.

\'Coming up?\' she asked.

Harry grinned and apparated up onto the branch, slipping an arm round her waist.

Fleur leant into his side. \'I still can\'t believe you\'re able to

apparate at fifteen, even if it's illegally.\'

\'You\'re just upset I can get up here, too.'

\'I\'m very glad you can join me up here,\' she murmured into

his neck.

Harry watched the flashing ripples of the river and the slim

shadows of darting fish. 'So am I. This place feels like a whole other world to me. One just for us.'

Fleur smiled, but straightened up and tucked her hair behind her ear. \'I\'m going to have to tell my parents about us soon. I never spent half so much time here before, they\'re suspicious.\'

\'I don\'t mind.'

\'Gabby has already guessed.\' Fleur laughed. \'She spends her time trying to work out how this happened. She wants to know the story. She spends too long reading romance books.\'

\'When do you plan on telling them?\' Harry asked. \'I should make sure I can come here to meet them.\'

\'I don't have a date,\' Fleur said. \'Whenever feels right. Or whenever Gabby finally figures out where I keep disappearing off to and tracks us down. I think she considers us her own personal romance story.\'

\'I shall have to give her my memories of the Room of Requirement,\' Harry muttered.

\'You're not showing her our first kiss.' Fleur turned her nose up. \'That moment's *ours*.\'

Harry chuckled. \'I meant the other memories.' \'What other memories?'

*I never told her, did I?* A lance of mortification pierced through him. *And now I remember why*.

\'It\'s not important.'

\'No. Nuh uh.' Fleur smirked. \'Too late. You have to tell me

now.\'

\'No I don\'t.\' Harry focused on a particular fish and watched it

flit about in the sun-dappled water. 'You can't make me.' 'Can't I?' A pair of cool fingers turned his face to hers.

*That's not playing fair.* Harry gazed into her summer sky blue eyes. His heart leapt into his mouth as a slight pout formed on Fleur's lips. *If I didn\'t know better, I'd still think it really is her magic.*

\'Fine.\' He sighed. 'You know, it's a good thing we tested your magic out this summer, or I'd still be sure you're using it on me.'

'I can't enthral you.' She kissed him on the jaw. 'Not with magic, anyway. Perhaps taking my top off would work.'

*Or laughing, or smiling, or kissing me.* Harry chuckled. 'It definitely would.' Fleur cocked her head and smiled at him.

'Oh alright.' He sighed. 'When we weren\'t speaking, I was still using the room on the seventh floor, but since it tries to give you what you want...\' Heat crept onto his cheeks.

\'The pictures...\' Fleur cupped his burning cheeks with her hands. \'I nearly saw those. You all but ran from the room before it changed back.\'

Harry squirmed. 'Yes. Well. I didn't exactly see *you* declaring

your feelings either.'

She laughed. \'Gabby would love to see that memory. She'd find it ever so romantic.'

\'It\'s embarrassing,\' Harry muttered. \'I could barely use the

room.\'

Fleur\'s hands slid up into his hair and she pulled his mouth

down to hers. \'I like the idea of you moping about me in a room full of my pictures. Will you do it again this year?\'

*Of course you like it*. *You've got a streak of pride in you as*

*wide as the river.*

\'If I can\'t visit you often, probably, yes,\' he replied. \'Have you told anyone about me?\' Fleur asked.

\'Sort of. I don\'t have any living magical relations, but I mentioned you to one of my friends. She asked about you last year.\'

*I don't think Salazar really counts.*

\'Katie Bell,\' Fleur growled.

\'Not a threat.\' Harry grinned. That's all in the past.\'

Fleur scowled. 'I'd definitely immolate her if she tried anything.'

'Nev sort of knows, too.\' Harry shrugged. 'He saw the room

when I was in it. Neither of them know about *us,* though.'

Fleur's lips twitched and she ran her fingers along the rough bark of the bough. \'I can\'t stay much longer. I'm not able to apparate to Beauxbatons because of the wards. I *still* want to know why you think you can apparate into Hogwarts, *especially* after you bounced off the wards last time you tried.\'

\'It\'s a *secret*.\' Harry glanced down and found her smile had faded. \'You have to go *now*, don\'t you?\'

'Sorry.' A faint pout formed on Fleur's lips. 'I'll enchant

something so we can stay in contact and send it to you.'

\'I\'ll send you a letter when it breaks,\' Harry said.

\'It will not break.\' Fleur leapt off the branch and landed on the balls of her feet with a soft thud. \'I will owl it to you, with a suitable phrase to use it, of course.\'

*Another joke in French at my expense, no doubt.* He rolled his eyes and apparated down behind her with a soft snap.

\'Still not silent,\' she teased.

'I don't have special veela magic to cheat with.\'

Fleur huffed. \'You're just envious. And your magic is not normal either, is it? You have a very unusual wand.\'

\'True, but I still don\'t have, how did you describe it, *soft*

*magic.*\'

\'It won't really make sense to you. You aren't veela, you

can\'t feel it. Gabby can feel almost everything about a piece of magic's intent if it's strong enough, but I can still feel enough to identify it.\'

\'Oh?\' Harry quirked an eyebrow.

'In the maze, I couldn't feel much more than that there was magic all around me. Too many spells all mixed together, and when it's all floating around like that, it's hard to get a sense for. Gabby told me it was roiling, hot, and angry. She said it was like boiling water, but hungry.\' Fleur laughed.

\'Well I was all of those, except hungry,\' Harry said.

\'I\'d love to know what spell you used to give off such an

aura.'

\'It\'s a secret,\' Harry teased.

better.\'

need it.'

Fleur turned her nose up at him. \'You\'re just afraid I\'ll do it

\'It\'s a fire spell. I know you\'ll be better at it, not that you

\'True.' Her face fell. \'I have to go now, Harry, but I\'ll enchant

something and send it to you as soon as I can so we can come back here.\'

\'I could spend forever with you here...\' Harry pressed his lips to her forehead. 'One day. I will.'

\'I know.\' She kissed him, pressing herself into him as if to try and keep the feeling of him with her a little longer, then she gave him one last smile and flickered away.

*Just to rub it in.*

Harry took one last look at the willow tree and the river, and

spun the world back past him into Salazar's study with a soft snap.

\'You\'re back.\' Salazar ran his eyes over him. 'In one piece,

too.'

Harry patted himself down. 'I believe so. I haven't splinched

since I went to Diagon Alley.'

\'What're you planning on learning today?\'

\'There\'s not too long before the welcoming feast,\' he said. \'So nothing complicated.\'

\'The welcoming feast,\' Salazar mused. \'Already? But you\'re not even halfway through what you wanted to learn over the summer.\'

\'Well---'

Salazar jabbed his wand at Harry, showering silver sparks down into the base of his frame. \'You told me that you expected to have finished all the OWL level work in the subjects you fell behind in last year!\'

\'I\'m ahead of where I wanted to be with my study of Occlumency, I caught up from last year, and I\'m already well past OWL level in some subjects,\' Harry said. \'And you should know what day and time it is, I bought a clock for you, it was the first thing I did this summer.\'

\'It broke.'

*Already?*

\'My point still stands,' Harry said.

\'And it\'s such a *good* point.\' Sarcasm dripped from Salazar's tongue. \'You excelled in an area that we have always been exceptional at and forgot about everything else.\'

\'It was the most important area,\' Harry muttered.

Salazar scowled. \'Of course, if you hadn\'t spent every second you could in *France*, you might've had another year to learn about the more interesting fields of magic.\'

*He's taking this a little harder than I expected.*

\'What don\'t I know?\' Harry asked.

\'Enough about magic to survive or stand a chance of defeating Voldemort,\' Salazar retorted. \'You\'ll get stronger naturally as you grow toward your physical and mental peak, or if you decide to keep moving through the pages of the books on rituals, but

knowledge is a part of power, Harry, and he has decades more of it than you.\'

Harry glowered at the painting. \'I don\'t *have* decades to spend learning, do I?\'

\'Which is why you can\'t afford to waste time.\' He shook his head when Harry\'s eyes narrowed. \'I\'m not saying spending time with her is a waste, I know better than most how valuable time like that truly is, but don\'t forget about everything else. It's a *balance*, Harry. You have something more than just surviving, and that's very important and very good, but you still need to *survive*.\'

*\'I know.\'*

\'I suppose you can learn about the more important areas of magic in our time down here,\' Salazar said. \'Legilimency is what we should start with. Tom was, as all our family is, talented at the mind arts. You need to be able to keep him out and use the skill against his followers.\'

\'I have no safe way of testing my prowess.\' Harry shrugged. \'Not without provoking Dumbledore to go rooting through my head.\'

\'That\'s a bad idea,\' Salazar muttered. \'And you can\'t exactly learn how I did.\'

\'Why not?\' Harry asked.

'I learnt from a sphinx. In my day, mind magic was very limited, so I tracked down a sphinx renowned for being interested in humans and learnt from it. Sphinxes are dangerous enigmatic creatures, no doubt it had its own reasons for teaching me, but the things I learnt and passed on were invaluable.'

you?\'

Harry blinked, recalling the sphinx in the maze. \'Did it test

\'No.\' Salazar shrugged. \'I'd made a name for myself by then

and it knew I was looking for it. Sphinxes live for thousands of years, but they\'re normally very reclusive. This one was interested in us; it spent centuries studying how we thought in comparison to how it did. I tracked it down near the Byzantine city of Ephesus and convinced it to teach me. It was an unexplored branch of magic back then, not many wizards bothered with it and most still don\'t. It takes a certain type of wizard or witch to understand and master it.\'

\'One tested me,\' Harry said.

Salazar dropped his wand. \'You *met* a sphinx?!\'

\'There was one in the tournament.' He frowned. 'Well, it was in the maze. I'm fairly sure it came just to test the *Heir of Slytherin.*'

'Perhaps it was the same one I learnt from.\' Salazar shook his head. 'Most of them don\'t care about wizards and their affairs, not when they can strip every thought from your head in an instant.\'

'This one just gave me a riddle.'

Salazar stroked his goatee. \'You lived, so let's not worry about it until we have to. I'll teach you the principles of legilimency. You\'ll have to find your own way to test yourself and your progress.\'

\'Now?\' Harry cast a tempus. 'There's not that long before I need to put in an appearance.'

\'I\'ll give you a brief introduction,\' Salazar said.

Harry took a seat behind the desk, pushing the stack of newspapers and the bag of galleons to one side.

\'Legilimency is not the opposite of occlumency.' Salazar plucked his wand from the bottom of his canvas. \'That\'s a generalisation made by wizards who don\'t understand the subject. Occlumency is organising and controlling your own emotions, memories, and thoughts, whereas legilimency is the art of reading and understanding those of others. It's a different principle entirely and far less obvious.\'

*Another complex, abstract thing. Fantastic.*

Salazar paused and polished his palms together. \'The first step is active legilimency. The incantation is *legilimens* and it requires direct eye contact for novices or the ungifted. This is not the same as transfiguration. You can\'t visualise it. Your intent must be entirely focused by will. Active legilimency is a battle of intellect and intent. The mind is not a straightforward object, you cannot read from its pages, meaning and connection must be gleaned by more abstract means.' Salazar grinned. 'Like all the best branches of magic!'

\'And passive legilimency?\' Harry asked. 'Dumbledore mentioned that.'

\'The more subtle aspect. It\'s an application of wandless, wordless, active legilimency and very hard to master. You have to perfectly find the edge of the knife, a legilimency attack so light it cannot be felt, but strong enough to skim the surface thoughts and emotions of your target.\' Salazar patted his snake on the head. 'Not an easy feat, even for a master.'

\'I felt it when Dumbledore tried to use it against me.'

Salazar nodded. \'As a practitioner of occlumency, you\'re much more aware of your thoughts, so you're more sensitive to such

attacks. He didn't know that, so he likely underestimated you. Be wary, now he knows you can detect it, he may still be trying, only more subtly.\'

\'I bet he is.' Harry's lip curled. 'But he won't get anything out of me. I've come a long way since I first drew that circle of ink on a page.'

'Go clear up your mess on your way to the feast,' Salazar told him. 'It's very rude to leave a huge corpse lying around like that.'

Harry rolled his eyes and strode out of the study, pausing before the gaping mouth of the basilisk and sending a thin stream of Fiendfyre down its throat. A crimson glow poured out through the dead serpent\'s mouth and eyes, brightening to white, then its scales paled and the whole thing crumbled to ash. Harry vanished the remnants and hurried up the steps.

\'Hey Myrtle,\' he called out into the toilet above the chamber.

A loud squeal of surprise came from one of the cubicles and the pearl-white figure zipped out through the walls. \'Harry.\' She fiddled with her thick-framed glasses and flushed silver as Fleur's hair. \'How'd you get here?\' Students aren\'t meant to be at the castle yet...'

\'I didn't want to catch the train with everyone else, so I thought I'd come say hi.\'

Myrtle's flush darkened. 'Heya Harry.'

Harry let the smile fade from his face. \'Things are going to be complicated this year. He\'s back, you know, the one who opened the chamber.\'

\'I thought Tom was *gone*.\' Myrtle turned so translucent Harry could see right through her.

\'I need you to watch the entrance for me, Myrtle,\' he asked. \'Tell me if you see anyone near it, or looking for it, anyone or anything suspicious at all.\'

\'I will, Harry. I promise.\' \'Thanks, Myrtle.\'

\'Any time.' She squeaked and fled back into her cubicle.

*Good. Now I have a guard on the entrance to the chamber.*

Harry cast his disillusionment spell and slipped through the throng of students flooding into the hall, sliding into a seat alongside Neville and dispelling his magic. \'Hey, Nev.\'

Nev flinched. \'Harry.\' He glanced down the table to where Seamus and Ron were whispering to one another. 'We didn't see you on the train.'

\'Don\'t worry about them, Nev.'

\'They might be angry that I\'m talking to you,' Nev

murmured.

\'Will that make you stop?\' Harry asked.

\'No.'

\'Then why worry?\'

Nev's brow creased. \'I suppose not. It\'s hardly anything compared to what the Daily Prophet has been writing about you and Dumbledore.\'

\'I have a very nice collection of headlines.\' Harry smiled. 'I quite like some of them, there are some good puns in there. *The Boy- Who-Lied. Potty Harry.*'

\'I had to make Gran subscribe again so I could see what they were writing.\'

*He argued with his grandmother? Well, Nev's a braver man*

*than most, from what I heard.*

Harry shrugged. \'I don't blame you. Rita Skeeter's a very good journalist. Terrible person, though. I do wonder how she finds out some of the things she does. Her articles on some of Dumbledore\'s more outspoken supporters were quite personal and unexpected.\'

*She better not find out about Fleur. A French veela would really be the last straw. I might have to flee the country.*

\'Are you coming back to Gryffindor Tower, then?\' Nev asked. 'You can\'t keep using the room, it isn\'t fair that you\'re uncomfortable in your own dormitories.\'

\'I\'ll come back. Best for me not to cause any trouble for a bit

if I can avoid it.'

The Sorting Hat's song came to a close and the first years began to line up. Harry ran his eyes along the staff table until they came to rest on a dumpy, wide-faced woman whose sweet smile and horrible pink, velvet attire turned Harry's stomach.

*Is that Madam Puddifoot?* Harry contemplated her attire.

*Well, I think I can be fairly sure she's not been possessed by Voldemort. I can't really imagine him wearing so much pink.* He snorted. *Although, he would definitely get me by surprise if he*

*lunged at me wearing that flamingo-pink cardigan. Missed opportunity for him.*

Steak and kidney pie materialised on the table in front of him, accompanied by more pumpkin-related products than he could turn his nose up at.

Katie gave him a wave and a wink from further down the table. Harry returned her smile and helped himself to a good amount of pie, keeping one eye on the teacher's table.

Dumbledore stepped toward the lectern. 'Welcome---'

The squat, pink-clad woman cleared her throat. \'My name is Dolores Umbridge, former Undersecretary to the Minister, and your new Professor for Defence Against the Dark Arts.\'

*Not Madam Puddifoot, but possibly a distant relation.* He tuned out the spiel on slipping standards and ministerial concern, Hermione\'s outrage, and the general muttering of the students. *The Ministry's afraid of Dumbledore\'s influence here. They're about half a century late to the party, really. Voldemort and Dumbledore are well- established.*

Umbridge sat down, a satisfied simper spread across her wide, pale face. The twinkle had faded from Dumbledore's eyes when he gave his short welcome address.

Nev glowered. 'She's awful. Gran's said *plenty* about her.'

*She's the catalyst. Whatever she does will give me the chance to wriggle free of Dumbledore and Voldemort. The more confusion she causes, the better for me.*

'We'll see what she does and be careful of her,' Harry

replied.

'You make it sound like quidditch.'

*Because it's like a game.* He grinned and let his thoughts drift to Fleur's sweet kisses, soft smiles, and the scent of burnt holly. *And we'll win. As always.*

# Madam Puddifoot

Harry stared up at the red and gold hangings as they rippled in the breeze from the window. A small part of himself urged him to charm them silver and blue. *But best not to give Seamus anymore ammunition to throw at Ron. Their arguments are annoying enough as it is.* He tugged his robes on and hurried down into a chair in the common room.

Nev staggered down after him with wet hair, his bag on his shoulder, and all his books in his arms. \'Seamus and Ron are arguing again.\' He borrowed the arm of Harry\'s chair to sort his things. \'They were having a *heated discussion* on the express, but they\'re just yelling stupid insults at each other in the bathroom now.\'

'About the Daily Prophet again?' Harry stifled a yawn. 'Does Seamus really believe that stuff?'

Nev shrugged. \'Not actually sure he does, but Seamus\' mum agrees with the Ministry and believes it. Ron, being an insensitive idiot at times, insulted her along with everyone else who reads it.

Seamus didn't take it lying down.\' \'At least it isn\'t about me.'

\'They weren\'t too bothered about anything the Prophet said about you. Ron mentioned his mum being upset, but he didn\'t care what they were writing about you. Said it was none of his business since you weren\'t friends anymore.\'

\'First intelligent thing he\'s done in a while.' Harry chivvied Nev's books off the arm of his chair.

\'Second.\' Nev laughed and stuffed his books into his bag. \'He believes Dumbledore, and by extension that you were put in the tournament by Voldemort, not hoodwinked by some dark wizard.\'

\'You said the name without stuttering.'

\'It gave Gran an awful shock.\' Nev slumped down into a chair. \'She was going on and on about how corrupt and useless the Ministry is and how there was no reason I could ever want to read anything in the Daily Prophet if it was basically promoting for You- Know-Who. I corrected the name and she stopped dead and renewed the subscription without a word.\'

\'She must've realised you knew what you wanted, Nev.'

Ron stormed through the common room wearing a thunderous expression.

\'Do you think I should say I told you so to Ron?\' Harry

quipped.

'Not unless you want to start a fight and cause trouble.\'

\'I\'m only joking, Nev,\' Harry said. \'It'd be silly to create

animosity between myself and someone who's fighting one of my

battles for me.\'

\'Breakfast?\' Nev asked.

\'Definitely. We\'ve got Snape with the Slytherins first thing again, I need a full stomach to cope.\'

The other students seemed to melt out of his path as he walked down the staircase toward the Great Hall. Neville stuck by him and most of the older students seemed content to ignore him,

but anyone who looked younger than about fourteen scattered like pigeons from a hawk.

*Gullible idiots.* Harry settled himself down on the table near

the door.

\'So where were you on the train this morning then?\' Neville

asked, helping himself to the toast rack.

A few of the more nervous Gryffindor first years darted past their spot near the doors, huddling together as they passed Harry.

\'I came in by myself,\' Harry said. \'Didn\'t fancy sharing a compartment on the train with any of that lot, so I avoided everyone.

Nev nodded. \'I\'m impressed you managed to stay out of sight for the whole journey. I think Malfoy was looking for you the entire time.'

\'I\'d\'ve ended up like this.\' Harry pointed at the several metre gap around them at the table. 'And Malfoy wasn't really missed, let's be honest.'

Nev wagged his finger. \'Nobody wants to sit next to a

dangerous murderer, Harry.'

Harry snorted. 'Why're you here, then? Safety in numbers?'

Hermione swung herself in next to Harry. Her bushy hair frizzed out like she'd woken up by sticking her finger in a plug socket. \'What happened in the maze?\'

\'Good morning, Hermione. Did you have a nice summer, Harry? How was the train journing, Hermione?' Harry raised his eyebrows at her. 'Why do you want to know?\'

She gasped. \'Viktor *died* in there.'

\'So I've heard.\' Harry grimaced through a twist of pity. 'I'm sorry, Hermione. I know the two of you were friends.'

\'The Daily Prophet's keen to spread the suggestion that you

were responsible,\' Hermione pressed.

*Nice try.*

\'I\'m not interested in what that paper says. I've honestly seen more truth in Trelawney's weekly deaths prediction list.' He sighed. 'I didn\'t see Krum die. I'm sorry.\'

\'No. It's okay, Harry.\' She chewed at her lip. \'I just -- I need to know what happened. Dumbledore said Voldemort was responsible, the Ministry blamed Ludo Bagman, but neither of them could have possibly cast the curse themselves.\'

*She's not going to let go of this until she hits a real dead end or thinks she's found an answer.* Harry weighed up his options. *Let's hope Cedric shuts her down and she hits that dead end.*

\'Have you tried asking Cedric Diggory?\' he suggested. \'He\'s the only other champion you can ask, but I don\'t know how much he\'ll remember. I stunned him when I came to investigate the screaming.\'

Hermione paled. \'The screaming?\'

Harry swallowed down the ice tightening in his chest. \'The

Beauxbatons champion. Someone cast the cruciatus curse on her.'

\'Oh.\' Some colour crept back into Hermione's face. 'Not

Viktor.'

A little cold crept into Harry's veins. \'Ask Diggory. The

Ministry's advised by Malfoy\'s father and he\'s probably not the only

supporter of Voldemort in their ranks either.\' Harry cast a glance at the distant pink figure of Professor Umbridge.

Hermione traced his gaze.

*So it begins.*

She poured herself a glass of water. \'So, Harry, *did* you have a nice summer?\'

Harry raised an eyebrow at her. \'Sorry,\' she muttered.

\'It was surprisingly tolerable.\' \'Your relatives?\'

Harry grinned. \'They weren\'t any trouble at all.\'

*They tried once or twice.* Harry let a broad smile creep across his face as recalled Vernon's quality alone time with the asp in the cupboard under the stairs and Dudley's horror as his steak turned into a pool of maggots. *Petunia should've really thanked me for that, I think it helped his diet more than any number of grapefruit ever could.*

\'That\'s good.\' Hermione caught sight of Cedric and bolted from the table.

*Bye, then.* Harry helped himself to more eggs. \'What *did* happen in the maze?\' Nev whispered.

\'You don\'t want to know, Nev,\' Harry said. \'I\'d rather not talk

about it either, I'm afraid.\'

'Fair enough.' Nev balanced slices of tomato along his toast and took a bite. He chewed it and groaned at the clock. 'Potions...'

\'Potions.\' Harry rushed down the last few forkfuls of eggs, gathered his bag from under the bench, and followed Nev down into the potions lab.

\'Ah.\' Snape's murmur echoed from the back of the dungeon as they found their seats. \'At last we have the privilege of Mr Potter\'s company again.\' He strode down the aisle between the desks, tutting under his breath. \'This June you will all be sitting an examination in which you'll prove just how much you've learnt about the composition and use of magical potions. Some of you...\' Snape's eyes drifted past Nev to rest on Harry. \'Some of you have not spent all of the last four years as wisely as they could've done.' He waved his wand at the board, revealing the recipe to the class.

*The Draught of Peace.*

\'Partner up,\' Snape drawled. \'And I suggest due diligence in the preparation of this particular potion, it requires a *delicate* touch.\'

\'Come on, Nev.' Harry began to arrange his things across the

desk between them.

\'You want to work with me?\' Nev squinted at him. 'In

*Potions?*'

\'Why would I choose anyone else?\' Harry asked.

\'I\'m terrible at Potions.'

\'You don\'t think well with Snape looming over you,\' Harry

said. \'There\'s no way he\'ll be able to pass up commenting on me, so if we\'re together, that means I\'ll draw all his attention.\'

'Okay, then.' Nev reached for the moonstone.

Harry caught his hand. \'Make sure everything happens exactly as it says on the board. I don\'t think Snape was joking about *due diligence*.\'

Nev gulped and began to add the powdered moonstone in small sprinkles as he stirred. The potion shifted to a bright purple.

*A Vernon's-about-to-explode shade of purple.* Harry admired the bright hue. *I think I quite like it.*

Nev's hand strayed toward the syrup of hellebore. \'Let it simmer,' Harry murmured.

Snape stared at the pair of them from his spot in the shadows at the back, an unreadable expression on his face. Harry ignored him.

A startled yelp echoed across the lab. Ron and Dean retreated from a potion spitting bright, violet sparks and releasing a loud hissing. The bowl of powdered moonstone sank into the cauldron.

\'That will be *zero*, Weasley, Thomas.\' Snape sneered and vanished the contents. \'Apparently when I instructed you to be careful, you thought yourselves above listening.\'

The potion in front of Harry flared pink. Nev stopped stirring and stared at it, glancing back and forth from the instructions to the cauldron.

*Is he really so surprised that it\'s working?* Harry got started grinding porcupine quills into a fine powder and left Nev to keep things simmering.

Snape drifted to loom over them. \'Longbottom, you\'ve found yourself a new victim.\'

\'Add these, Nev.' Harry passed the porcupine quills across and stepped around in between Nev and Snape, making a show of retrieving the powdered unicorn horn.

Snape fixed Harry with a piercing stare, turned on his heel and stalked to the front of the class.

Their brew came to a thin, ivory-hued liquid that, when Harry or Neville forgot to stir and it grew too hot, would thicken just enough to let off the merest hint of a shimmer. Around them, the rest of the class sat on their hands or continued to add more porcupine quills to yellow-tinted potions.

\'We did okay.\' Harry glanced around. 'A bit better than

most.'

Malfoy's potion had reached a similar sort of state as theirs,

though his potion retained an odd glow and looked more yellow than white. Hermione's glimmered just as the recipe prescribed, but remained an odd silvery-grey.

*It looks a bit like Bertha Jorkins' hand.*

\'If you are.... *finished.*\' Snape\'s eyes swept across the class, pausing only to rest on Harry's, Hermione's, and Malfoy's potions. \'Bring a flask of your potion to my desk.\'

\'I\'ll do it, Nev,\' Harry said. \'You start tidying up.\'

He filled one of the flasks with extreme care. *Nev managed to weaponise a pepper-up potion, so best to take great caution with this one.*

Snape slid the flask across the surface of his desk to rest next to Hermione's and Malfoy's. \'Remain behind, Potter. I need to make sure your latest year of glory hasn\'t dragged your grade down past its usual level of mediocrity.\'

*Well, it wouldn\'t be potions without detention or points lost.*

Harry leant against the corner of the bench nearest Snape\'s desk and waited for the class to leave.

\'Why did you partner with Longbottom?\' Snape demanded. Harry kept his face unreadable. \'He\'s my friend.\'

\'Well, despite your choice of partner, your brew is marginally better than the only other two I shall spend my time grading.\' Snape\'s tone shifted into something almost neutral. \'It seems you might have a chance of continuing to learn from me after this year, so long as you keep Longbottom from destroying your work.\'

\'Perhaps, sir,\' Harry said. \'You might consider not standing

over him as he works, he doesn't need to be intimidated.\'

Snape\'s eyes flashed. \'I have kept you behind, Potter, to inform you that you need to be *much* more careful. The headmaster believes you'll somehow be very important in the coming war against the Dark Lord. I have warned him that he shouldn\'t expect too much from a child, but he was adamant. The headmaster also insisted I gently remind you that apparating around your house and vanishing every other day is not a good idea.\'

Harry scowled. *How did he know? And why tell Snape of all*

*people?*

\'*I* will tell you that not only is it not a good idea to risk the *justice* of the Ministry, but it is a terrible idea to act so irresponsibly in the face of the Dark Lord\'s return.\' Snape stalked round his desk and pulled out a thin parcel wrapped in brown paper and tied with string with a sneer. \'Black sends his love. He\'d have got himself killed sneaking out to see you if we hadn\'t promised him a way of communicating, so take this. It\'s an enchanted mirror, two-way, speak Black\'s first name to activate it and if he\'s near the mirror, which I\'m sure will be at all times, then you\'ll get an answer.\'

\'Thank you, sir.\' Harry took the parcel and slipped it inside his robes.

\'And Potter.\' Snape's neutral demeanour returned. \'Next time you want to distract the Dark Lord, it would be best not to do it by claiming to have killed his more useful servants.\'

Harry\'s eyes snapped up to the dark orbs of his professor and emptied his thoughts.

\'We both know that you lied to the Dark Lord, but he seems to believe you, despite any advice to the contrary.\' Snape swooped round the desk to grab Harry\'s wrist. His fingernails bit into Harry's skin. \'Do you understand, Potter? He is taking you *seriously* now.\'

Harry tugged his arm free. \'He wasn\'t before?\'

\'Get out, Potter.\' No anger coloured Snape's tone.

*Time to see Madam Puddifoot.* Harry drifted toward defence against the dark arts. *I'm already late, so I guess how she acts will be a good indication of why she's here.*

He slipped inside. 'Sorry I'm late, professor. Professor Snape

needed to speak to me.'

The squat, pink-draped woman looked up from the front. \'Mr

Potter...\' She simpered. 'Do you have a note?\'

\'Sadly the professor neglected to burden me with one.\' He smiled and took a seat at the back beside Nev.

\'That will be ten points from Gryffindor for lying, Potter.\' Umbridge's high, girlish voice grated on Harry's nerves. \'Lying's a terrible habit to get into.\'

He suppressed a wry smile. *Ten meaningless house points*

*isn't a bad price for learning what you're here for.*

'As I was saying before Mr Potter started spinning stories, your education in this subject has been unacceptably broken up. A new teacher every year, all very poor choices, and jumping all over the curriculum, with no regard to what the Ministry knows you need to understand.\' She tutted, pulled a short, thick wand from her handbag, then gave it a sharp flick.

The stack of books on her desk jerked into the air and drifted round the room to thud down before every member of the class.

*Defensive Magical Theory.* Harry flicked through a few pages of childish pictures and dense text. *Well, anyone without outside help or a lot of natural talent can kiss their OWLs goodbye.*

\'I have a question?\' Hermione waved her hand in the air and stared down at her open copy.

\'Is it about the book, Miss...?\' Umbridge adjusted her lurid, pink cardigan.

\'Granger. And not entirely.\'

\'Well, if it isn\'t about the book, perhaps you can wait to see me at the end.\'

\'My question is about the aim of the course,\' Hermione said. \'It\'s our *OWL year*, Professor Umbridge, and I\'m not convinced this book is sufficient to enable us to pass.\'

*Well, at least she was intelligent enough not to directly challenge her in her own classroom. I don't think many others would've managed to phrase it as well.*

\'The Ministry has consulted the opinions of several very experienced witches and wizards, Miss Granger, there's no need for concern. I can assure all of you that this will be completely unlike previous years where you have been exposed to some very dangerous *creatures*.\'

Harry had the feeling she wasn\'t referring to Grindylows and Boggarts. A little ice trickled through his veins. *A bigot, too. And most probably a pureblood.*

\'There\'s no mention of using magic,\' Dean called. 'What are we going to be doing?'

\'Please raise your hand if you wish to speak...\' \'Dean Thomas.'

\'Why on earth, Mr Thomas, do you think you will need to use dark or dangerous spells in a classroom?\' Umbridge tittered. \'It\'s quite ridiculous.\'

\'How else are we going to be prepared for what\'s out there?\' Ron demanded.

*Ah, here we go.* Harry concealed a smile. *Umbridge is about to kick off her manifesto.*

\'Raise your hand, Mr Weasley,\' Umbridge snapped.

*She recognises the pure-bloods, then*. Harry leant back in his chair. *She's going to make herself very unpopular very fast.*

\'There's nothing out there.\' She plastered a sweet smile across her pallid face. \'The Ministry is merely concerned for the safety of the children of our society.\'

\'Then they should teach them defensive magic and let them practice it,\' Ron burst out. \'Or You-Know-Who is going to wander across this country killing who he bloody wants, isn't he?\'

\'Ten points from Gryffindor,\' Umbridge hissed. \'I will not tolerate such language or such lies in my classroom. The rumour and fear-mongering of a few questionable individuals is not to be listened to. The Ministry clearly stated the truth of events.\'

Every eye in the classroom turned to him.

*Oh no. I don't need to dig Umbridge out of this hole. She can make a mess of it by herself and go back to waiting tables on Valentine's Day in Hogsmeade.*

Harry grinned. \'I agree. You shouldn\'t swear in class and listening to baseless rumours is ill-advisable.I\'m sure the Ministry is doing its *utmost* to discredit them.'

Hermione pursed her lips, then gave Harry a small nod. A slow ripple of realisation crossed the classroom.

Umbridge's eyes blazed as she fixed her smile on her face. \'Turn to the first chapter of your books, please.'

Harry picked a point about midway through the first chapter and ran his hand along the spine to keep the book open there.

*I\'ll have to ask Salazar about legilimency*. *I need to practice it somehow.*

He turned a few pages further and pushed his wand up the inside of his sleeve, catching it when it fell. Small surges of warmth shivered up his arm each time he touched it. Out of the corner of his eye, he watched Ron, Dean, and Hermione muttering while Umbridge glared at them.

*I'm not first in the line of fire now. And I imagine there'll be a fair few who realise that my enemy's enemy is my friend.*

\'There\'s no way I\'m going to pass this class\' OWL exam now,\' Nev fretted.

\'You aren\'t going to learn anything useful here, but I promised to help you, didn\'t I?\'

\'You\'ll help me pass?\' Nev abandoned his book to stare.

Harry tapped its pages. \'Of course I will.' He turned back to the pages of Umbridge\'s textbook, flipping through the last few to the end of the chapter. \'We can go up to the Room of Requirement again, Nev,\' he muttered. \'We need to find a copy of the curriculum first, though. I learnt lots of practical spells, but I don\'t know everything about dark creatures and the like.\'

\'I\'ll ask Hermione,\' Nev said. 'She'll know---'

Umbridge stood up from the front, peering at the back of the

class. 'No whispering! Whomever's whispering is in detention.'

Harry snorted under his breath. *Madam Puddifoot's*

*probably a better teacher.*

# The Weird Sisters

A cold, salt-scented wind shrieked through the corridor.

Screams and moans echoed into her room, distorted and twisted by the wind, and waves crashed in the distance. Goosebumps rose along her skin.

Frost spread across the floor. Sea-spray and condensation froze into intricate patterns.

'Oooh, pretty.' She brushed the tatters of her black dress out the way and used the tip of her finger to draw her name in the ice. 'Bella!' She giggled. 'That's me!'

A chill settled over her cell. A dementor hovered beyond the bars; its rattling breath and old, foul reek clouded everything nearby.

Bella bounced to her feet. 'Unless you've come to take me up on playing noughts and crosses, you can go away. We're not friends!'

The cold seeped into her, sliding deep beneath her skin.

Andi's shocked, horrified face swirled through her thoughts.

Cissy's scream. A marble balustrade slipped away from her small fingers and fear crashed over her like an avalanche as the floor rushed up to meet her. Her shriek echoed from years ago.

'Stop it!' Bella scraped a handful of ice off the floor and hurled it at the dementor. 'You're so annoying!'

It gripped the bars with skeletal fingers and took a long, rattling breath.

*No! Bella!* Her mother's raw screams rang through her mind.

*Andi! Cissy! What were you doing?!*

Fire flashed through Bella's veins. 'I said stop it!'

A ripple of air tossed the dementor away down the corridor.

Bella pressed her face to the bars and stuck her tongue out

at it. 'That'll teach you!'

A low groan rose from the opposite cell. 'Bella, leave them alone. They don't like it when you mess with them. And the rest of us aren't batshit crazy and will actually feel it when they all come to investigate.'

'Shut up, strange boy.' Bella watched the dementor float away. 'Nobody asked you, did they?'

A deep sigh echoed from the cell. 'No, Bella.'

'Yeah!' Bella stuck her finger through the bars at strange boy's cell. 'So be quiet!' She twirled on the spot near the door. 'I'm a -- I'm a -- I'm a... weird sister.'

'Can you please shut the fuck up!' A man's voice yelled from her left. 'You've been singing that one line of that one song for almost fifteen years! It's not even a *good* song!'

*But it's the only song I know.* Bella pouted. *It's not my fault Andi kept singing just the one line. It stuck.* She twirled once more. *Who was it that hates my singing? Oh, of course, Sirius hated my singing.*

'Is that you again, Sirius, you mutt?' Bella shouted. 'I'm not talking to you! You ran off! You didn't even tell me we were on the same side all along!'

*He left us\...*

She cocked her head. 'Wait, didn't you escape, Sirius? Why did you come back?'

'That's not Sirius Black.' Strange boy pounded his fist on the metal door. 'You all shut up and stop antagonising her. You know what happens!'

'She's fucking insane!'

Bella huffed. 'That's a bad word and I don't even know you!' 'Are you joking?!' The man yelled back. 'We've been here for

fifteen years and we knew each other for almost fifteen years before

that!'

'Well, you must be very boring, because I've forgotten all about you!' Bella twirled around and hummed Andi's song to herself. 'I'll probably forget all about you again when we get out of here!'

Another groan echoed from down the corridor. 'The Dark Lord's dead, Bellatrix. The Potter child killed him somehow. We're not leaving here.'

'Nuh uh.' Bella giggled. 'This is why you all always lose. You don't think right. If you're good, you make sure you've got a trump card.'

Strange boy's grimy, bearded face appeared behind the bars of his cell. 'Well, if he's not dead, then why are we still in here?'

'Maybe he's busy.' Bella shrugged. 'He's got to play the game, he can't take his eyes off it to come rescue us. We should probably try and escape, really. I'd expect us to try and escape.'

'No!' The other man's voice echoed down the corridor. 'We're

not trying another one of your stupid escape plans!'

Bella stuck her tongue out at the wall between her and the

voice. 'Awww, why not?'

Strange boy smeared dirt off his face with his sleeve. 'Because the last few times, you let us all out of our cells and just stayed in yours. Rookwood has a point.'

Bella crossed her arms. 'But that wasn't an escape plan!' 'You said it was!'

'Of course I did.' She grinned. 'It was the only way to get you and the dementors to play hide and seek together. I wanted to watch someone play hide and seek. It's been ages since I played with Andi and Cissy.'

Strange boy sighed. 'You're mad, Bella.'

Bella pouted. 'So? You're boring, strange boy. And you stare at me all the time.'

'That's because your dress is basically rags,' the other man shouted. 'And even though you're fucking insane, you're still hot! Why did they have to put bloody Lestrange opposite you, we all know him and his brother would rather stare at each other!'

Fire exploded in Bella's blood. 'Be quiet!' A ripple of magic shook through the walls. Dust trickled down from the ceiling. 'It's not nice to stare, *especially* at girls who aren't wearing much. I'm not talking to you now, fake Sirius!'

Strange boy brushed the dust out of his hair. 'Enough, Rookwood! Keep winding her up and see if she doesn't bring the place down on our heads or all the dementors back again!'

Silence fell.

Bella listened to the scream of the wind and the crash of the waves. Thin, cloaked figures swirled through the air beyond her window. *This place is boring. Maybe I should take another nap?*

'I'm a -- I'm a -- I'm a... weird sister. I'm a -- I'm a -- I'm a... weird sister. I'm a -- I'm a -- I'm a... weird sister.' She twirled on the spot. 'I wonder what Andi and Cissy are doing? I hope they're not having fun without me.'

She danced from one side of the cell to the other, prancing from the rough wall to the smooth, mirror-bright one. Frost flecked all the walls.

'Stupid floating skeletons, they make it so messy.' Bella tore off another scrap of her dress and polished the frost from the smooth side of her cell.

Her reflection's bright purple eyes stared back from the smooth stone. Her tangled, black curls hung to her knees. Pale, dirt- marred skin spread where the rags of her black dress didn't cover her.

'Hi Bell.' Bella gave her reflection a wave, then wagged her finger at it. 'You look like you need a bath, young lady.'

*We really are kind of mad, Bella.* Bella cocked her head and stared into her purple eyes. *Not really, Bell. We know we're talking to ourself, so we can't really be mad.*

'But we still do it, I guess.' She shrugged and sat down on the floor. 'Well, Bell, if the Dark Lord doesn't decide to come and let us out soon, maybe we should find our own way out.'

*Sirius managed it.* Bella stared into her reflection's eyes. *He*

*really should've taken us with him, Bell.*

She huffed dust off her tattered dress. 'I wonder why he didn't?'

*Because we're better than him at the game, Bella. Nobody*

*wants to lose.*

'Maybe.' Bella stared up at the arched ceiling. 'Still, you have to play, Bell. It's not fun for anyone if you sit out. I hate it when people try and ruin things for other people. Everyone loses eventually, even those of us with trump cards.'

*We should use ours, Bella.* Her reflection's purple eyes

glowed. *It's boring in here. It's soooo boring. We should leave.*

'Strange boy doesn't even want to play noughts and crosses with us anymore,' Bella murmured. 'Maybe we'll go, Bell.' She closed her eyes and let the faint threads of violet magic guide her.

A pair of little girls swayed and danced in the eye of her mind. Their eyes burnt with purple flame. Violet light stretched from their limbs like strings, reaching off into the dark.

Footsteps thudded down the corridor. Bella opened her eyes. 'A visitor, Bell!' *Maybe it's an auror, Bella.*

Strange boy stuck his head up in the cell door window again. 'Been a long time since anyone's come down here. Not since Sirius Black escaped.'

'Silly mutt.' Bella huffed. 'He should've taken me with him.

Aunt Walburga meant him to look out for me.'

A sharp-collared, black-robed auror stepped in between them.

He clutched a small envelope in his fist. 'Bellatrix Lestrange?'

'Just Bella!' Bella stuck her hand through the bars. 'Is it a present? Is it my birthday?' She cocked her head. 'When *is* our birthday, Bell?'

*We don't remember.* She clawed her way back through endless days in her room to *before.* Grey eyes shone back from her hand mirror as Cissy struggled to braid Bella's dark curls. Her sisters' laughter rang through a light, bright, London townhouse*.* Andi's terrified face loomed out of her memories and the marble floor flashed up toward her. *Don't think about then, Bella.*

Bella glanced back at her reflection. Her purple eyes shone

like stars. 'We've forgotten, auror. Can we have it anyway, please?'

The auror opened the letter, then ran his wand over it. 'Yes. It seems clean.' He gestured with his wand. 'Step back.'

'Oh, I wouldn't go in.' Strange boy pressed his face against the bars of his cell. 'The last auror who went in had to be cleaned off the floor using a mop.'

Bella giggled. 'He was rude and he smelt.' She hopped back from the door and waggled her finger. 'You shouldn't snatch.'

The auror slid the letter through the bars, turned on his heel, and strode away. Bella grabbed the letter out of the air and listened to his footsteps fade.

'You didn't do anything, Bella?' Strange boy scowled. 'You

should've ripped him apart.'

She cocked her head, swiping her tangled curls off her face.

'Why? He wasn't rude?' 'Because he's the enemy!'

Bella shrugged and unfolded her letter. 'It's from Cissy!' She scanned the small, cramped lines of text. 'Urgh, she's gotten so boring. Look at all this writing.' Bella shook the letter up near the bars.

'What does it say?'

She stuck her tongue out at strange boy. 'It's my letter, from

*my* sister. You get your own.'

Strange boy sighed. 'You're a terrible wife.'

Bella huffed. 'It just talks about boring stuff. My husband's worried. My son's stressed. Wow, ickle Draco's grown up quite a bit, I thought he was just a baby?'

'He was, fifteen years ago...'

She glanced at her reflection. Crow's feet marked the corner of her eyes and faint lines creased her forehead. *We've been in here for a while, Bella.*

'Huh,' Bella murmured. 'I forgot that would happen.' She skimmed through the rest of the writing. 'Anyway, just more boring stuff. Harry Potter's turned up, doesn't seem to get on with Draco, which is a shame, because they're both part of the family.' She cocked her head. 'I guess you can't always get on with your cousins, though. Sirius has always been mean to me, the mangy liar.'

Strange boy sighed and banged his forehead against the bars

of his cell. 'Bellatrix? Is there anything in there about us?'

Bella finished reading. 'No.' She shredded the letter into tiny bits of paper and flapped it about the room. 'Look, it's like snow, strange boy!' She watched it drift to the floor. 'It's been ages since we saw any snow.'

'I hope, if we get out of here, you go back to the usual level of mad, Bella.' Strange boy continued bumping his head into the metal bars. 'You're really a bit much like this. Though, the frustration of dealing with you has kept me somewhat sane, I suppose.'

'Oh!' Bella found another piece of the letter beneath the

shredded bits. 'I missed a bit.'

An ink serpent coiled on pale parchment, then crumpled to

ashes.

*He's back, Bella.* She stared at the fading glow of the ashes,

then down at the tattoo on her arm, then back at the ashes. The mark on her arm turned dark and writhed beneath her skin; it stung like fire. *This means -- this means it's time to start playing again.* A broad grin spread across her face and a laugh burst from her lips. *Guess we can wait a bit longer before we leave, Bell.*

'Bella?' Strange boy froze. 'Bellatrix?'

Bella held up her forearm. 'I told you, strange boy. The best

players always have a trick up their sleeve.'

'The Dark Lord,' strange boy whispered. 'He's coming back for

us.'

'Game time,' Bella crowed. 'Ohhhhh, it's been *so long*. I'm

probably all rusty.'

# Meet the Delacours

Sunlight filtered through the willow leaves, glowing red beyond Fleur's eyelids. Heat soaked into the smooth bark and her skin. She yawned and opened her eyes, then fished her necklace out of the front of her robes.

A silver seed dangled from a slim, shining chain; an acorn hanging from its cup of celtic knots. The sun flashed off it, stabbing at Fleur's eyes. She pulled her wand from her waist and touched its tip to the seed. Her magic swirled through the silver, spiralling into its centre and flitting back and forth from there to its distant twin.

\'Azure,\' she murmured.

The chain melted back into the seed like a stream into a lake; it hovered in the air like heat haze. Silver branches sprouted from it, putting forth tiny, shining leaves, identical roots webbed beneath. A faint shimmer rippled through the metal, then it spread into a mirror no larger than the spread of Fleur's hand.

Her own blue eyes stared at her in the bright surface, then a

soft glow suffused the silver and Harry's face appeared. 'Fleur?' He raised an eyebrow. 'You're free?'

'Want to come visit?\' She smirked. 'I'll warn you now that it's another trap. Gabrielle let slip that I've been seeing a boy for the first time, the annoying little chicken.'

He laughed and the mirror shifted. Fleur caught a brief glimpse of shelves of books and an imposing portrait in green and silver, then the surface of her mirror darkened. It shrank back into a seed and the chain slipped back around her neck.

A soft snap echoed across the river.

Fleur dropped her necklace down the front of her robes and twisted round.

Harry leant against the tree trunk, staring up at her with a broad half-smile on his face as he tucked her picture portkey into his pocket. 'You look amazing.'

Fleur dropped off her branch. 'As always.' She buried her

face in his chest and breathed in the warmth of him. \'I missed you.'

'Good.' Harry squeezed her closer to his chest. 'I'd hate to think it was just me.'

She leant back and kissed him. 'Are you ready for the trap?'

Fleur switched to French.

Harry rolled his eyes. 'Just about.' His accent wobbled. Fleur wrinkled her nose. 'Just about.'

He laughed. 'I learnt a whole language over the summer for you. And I helped you get a little better with your English, too. Are you *ever* satisfied?'

'Non.' A pout crept onto her lips. 'Not until things are

perfect.'

*'You're* perfect.' Harry's hands encircled her waist and his

lips brushed her forehead. 'As always.'

Fleur's heart squirmed. 'Come on. My parents are waiting... *impatiently*.' She grabbed his hand and tugged him along the river shore to the bank and the grass slope up toward home.

Harry let her tow him. 'What about Gabby?'

'Distracted by her newfound ability to hurl fire at things.' She laughed. 'It *is* the bestpart of growing up as a veela. A good thing maman fire-proofs everything.'

'I'm not fire-proof.' A flicker of emotion passed through Harry's eyes as he stared past her toward the chateaux.

Fleur hung back a step and gave his hand a gentle squeeze.

'Theydon't bite, mon Cœur. Am I not worth it?'

Harry chuckled. 'I'd promise you that I'd walk through fire for you, but I'm a little worried I may have to. My reputation's not at its all-time high right now.'

'Nobody here believes that silly English paper.\' Fleur huffed.

\'They might be a bit protective, though.\'

'Can't blame them for that, I guess.'

'Come on*.*' Fleur tugged at his hand. 'I'll apparate us the rest of the way. You aren\'t included in the chateau\'s wards, I have to take you in with me.\'

\'I\'m not all that surprised you live in a chateau,' Harry

murmured.

\'All old french houses are called chateaux.\' Fleur shrugged. \'You\'ll see.\'

She pictured the entrance hall of her home, with its open, sandstone walls and floor, the scatter of Gabby's shoes, and the handful of tasteful landscapes of pine covered mountain slopes, enchanted to change with the seasons. A soft snap and they stood there staring down at Gabby's collection of footwear.

\'It looks a lot like a chateau to me,\' Harry whispered. \'I think

I\'m beginning to see where Gabby's first scene in our story will start.\'

\'We don\'t have a tallest tower and I am not a princess.\'

Fleur wrinkled her nose. 'Not that Gabby will let that stop her.'

\'You already dealt with your own dragon, too.\' Harry let out a quiet chuckle. \'No self-respecting princess would interfere with the hero\'s task like that.\'

\'Perhaps you should've let me deal with the Horntail, then?\'

\'I seem to remember you not wanting to face that particular dragon, you were one of the lucky three whose dragon had actually been tamed.\'

Fleur stuck her nose in the air to hide her smile. \'A dragon is a dragon. Now stop delaying, my family's waiting.\' She ushered him down the entrance hall into the main hall. \'Maman, papa, we are here.\'

\'Fleur.\' Her parents sat on the far side of the hall on the ivory sofa. The empty fireplace yawned beyond them. 'We were just about to head out for a wander round the gardens.'

*Nice try. I know you were waiting here in case I tried to sneak through.*

\'And you must be?\' Papa stood up.

\'Harry.\' The corner of Harry's mouth twitched.

\'It\'s nice to meet you.\' Maman clasped Harry's hand between hers and pressed her lips to either of his cheeks. \'I'm Fleur\'s mother.'

Fleur stifled a wince as Harry tensed. *I forgot to tell them not to get too close.*

Papa stepped forward. 'Laurent. Fleur's father, obviously.

You can clearly see she got all her beauty from me.'

Maman laughed. 'Do not listen to Laurent, Harry. The only thing my daughter inherited from him is her stubbornness and her temper.'

Papa's eyebrows disappeared into his hair. '*My* temper, Petite Fleur?'

A delighted cry echoed down the hall. \'You finally brought him to meet me!\' Gabby tossed a pair of shoes down the entrance hall and darted over the stone floor.

\'Gabby, I presume.\' Harry extended a hand.

She bounded past it and wrapped Harry in a hug, plastering both cheeks with kisses. \'We\'ve already met, actually. You saved me from the Black Lake for Fleur.\' Gabby giggled and released Harry.

Fleur vanished the faint red marks of Gabby's lip gloss and

shot her little sister a warning glare.

\'It would be Harry Potter, then, would it?\' Papa asked,

shaking Harry's hand.

\'Just Harry suits me fine. My surname always seems to

complicate things.'

\'Well, it is almost lunch,\' maman said. \'You\'re most welcome to join us, Harry.\'

*A well-planned ambush.* Fleur smothered a faint trickle of heat. *And they said they just wanted to meet him briefly.*

Harry fixed a bright smile on his face. \'I\'d love to.'

*Poor Harry.* Fleur squeezed his fingers.

\'We usually eat in the kitchen,' Papa said. \'It\'s a little more informal and you don't have to shout all the way down the table.\'

Her parents drifted toward the kitchen.

Gabby threw a glance at Fleur. Mischief burnt in her baby

sister's eyes. \'Sorry, Fleur,\' she chirped, staring right at Harry.

Harry blinked and shot Fleur a rather bemused look.

*Did she just try and charm him?!* Heat bubbled in Fleur's

bones and feathers prickled beneath her skin. *You're dead, Gabby!*

She motioned for Harry to follow her Maman 'round the doorframe and pinned Gabby against the wall. *\'What* were you trying to do?\'

Gabby giggled.

\'Gabrielle,\' Fleur hissed, letting some of the heat seep out of her bones until she felt her face shift.

\'He didn\'t even notice,\' Gabby whispered. \'And that was everything I could direct at him!' She squealed. 'He must *really* love you, Fleur.\'

\'Did you just use your magic to *test* Harry?\' Fleur demanded.

'You *know* it doesn't even work like that!'

\'I don\'t have magic like yours, Fleur, but *nobody* ever just doesn\'t notice it like that.\' Gabby's eyes turned dreamy and she wriggled out from under Fleur\'s arm. \'It must be true love.'

*I\'m burning every single romance novel in this house*. She hauled Gabby after her into the kitchen. *It's for her own good.*

\'Are you going to tell me why Gabby decided to try and charm me?\' Harry murmured as Binky made the food appear in front of them. A simple, Italian salad of goat's cheese, artichoke hearts, and olives, with basil, bay leaves, and oregano scattered over it appeared on plain, white bowls.

\'She wanted to see how much you loved me.' Fleur threw a dirty look at where Gabby was making eyes at the pair of them across the table. 'It doesn't even work like that.'

*Or she wanted to show me how much you loved me. She's*

*a sneaky little chick.*

\'So you\'re the heir of the Potter family?' Papa leant forward. 'As far as I know,\' Harry said. 'I've not met any others.' \'That\'s a big name to be responsible for, especially in Britain

where pure-blooded families are still held in such high-esteem,\' papa

said.

\'I\'m not a pure-blood.\' Harry shrugged. \'My mother was from muggle parents.\'

\'Ah.' Papa took a sip of water. \'If I remember correctly, the Potter family has some quite illustrious ancestry. A great number of great names ended up becoming Potter.\'

A slight flush climbed up Harry's face. \'Honestly, I wouldn\'t know. My only living relations are muggles from my mother\'s family. I know very little about the Potter family, only that it nearly came to a very abrupt end fifteen years ago.\'

you?\'

Papa's eyes sparkled. \'I know a little if you want me to tell

*Please no.* Fleur stifled a groan. *Not another history*

*conversation.*

\'Perhaps another time, Laurent.' Maman shared a small smile with Fleur. \'I understand you won the Triwizard Tournament, Harry?\'

\'I think I simply lost the least.\' Harry studied his fork. 'It didn't quite go as it was meant to.'

Fleur poked him in the thigh with her wand. *I should've told him I'd not said anything about the third task.*

\'Fleur was quite confident that she would win,\' Laurent said.

A broad grin spread across Harry's face. \'Yes. When I asked for her name the first time we spoke to each other, Fleur told me I could read it off the Triwizard Trophy at the end.\'

Gabby giggled and opened her mouth. Fleur kicked her under the table.

\'Fleur said that she would beat you by such a margin in the last task that it would make you losing points for rescuing me irrelevant,' Gabby said.

Fleur released a quiet sigh. *I said a whole lot worse than*

*that.*

\'I didn\'t in the end,' she said. 'But Harry had help, so I don't

think it counts.'

Papa put down his silverware. 'Help? You cheated?'

'Laurent...' Maman tapped her nails on the table. 'What did happen in the third task? Fleur said she was knocked unconscious early on by one of the other champions, but she was being evasive, and there were stories in the papers and rumours that contradict each other.\'

Harry glanced at Fleur. \'A wizard, one of the judges, interfered with the task. He was responsible for everything that happened in the maze. Viktor Krum was killed, Fleur was attacked and stunned about halfway in, and I got Cedric Diggory.\'

Maman pursed her lips. \'Fleur said she was found on her own, at the centre of the maze?\'

A slight red tinge crept up Harry\'s cheeks.

\'Harry took me with him,\' Fleur said. \'It wasn\'t safe.\'

\'That\'s so romantic.\' Gabby sighed. \'Why couldn\'t you have chosen someone your own age, Fleur? I'd love to be carried to safety by a nice wizard one day.\'

Harry\'s cheeks flared bright crimson. Fleur felt the heat rush to her face and stamped on Gabby\'s toes under the table. Her sister squeaked and closed her mouth.

Fleur glared at her. *Say something like that again at your*

*own risk*.

Gabby shot her a wounded expression and her parents half-

hid their smiles behind their hands.

Silverware scraped and clinked as they finished their meal. Harry picked his way through with great care, grimacing faintly with each olive until the clock chimed from the kitchen wall.

\'You need to return to Hogwarts,\' Fleur said.

Harry glanced up at the clock, then nodded. 'I do.'

\'You are welcome to stay,\' maman suggested. \'There are plenty of spare rooms.\'

Gabby pulled her feet back under her chair. \'Or you can just

share with Fleur, Harry. I'm sure she'd prefer that.\'

\'I'd be missed if I was away for any longer,\' Harry said. 'But

thank you. The food was fantastic and it was nice to finally meet you.\'

A small pout crept onto Fleur's lips. *Make it sound like I kept us apart, why don\'t you?*

Papa's face creased into a smile. \'Then it was a pleasure to

meet you, Harry.\'

Maman nodded. \'You\'re welcome back whenever.'

\'Bye, Harry,\' Gabby chirped, giving him a cheerful wave. Harry raised an eyebrow at Fleur.

\'It will work,\' she said.

He reached out and gave her hand a gentle squeeze, vanishing with a soft snap.

Maman rose from her chair. 'Gabby, come help me tidy your

shoes away.'

Gabby pouted, but let Maman lead her away through to the entrance hall.

Papa folded his arms at the far end of the table. \'He\'s a fair bit younger than you, but he seems mature enough. I don\'t dislike *him*.\'

Fleur narrowed her eyes at him. 'I'm not asking for permission, Papa. It's *my* choice.'

Papa sighed and raised his hands. 'I know, ma cherie. He is *British*, though. He seems like a good choice, especially as he was unaffected by the magic of my three ladies, but Britain isn't the same as France, or the rest of Europe and the old magical countries.\'

'So?\' Fleur crossed her arms. 'I didn't choose the country. I

chose *Harry*.'

Papa pinched the bridge of his nose. \'That short stretch of sea between France and Britain has kept them isolated and exempt from the turbulence of the last few centuries. Across Europe, revolutions have come, then wars, and Grindelwald\'s anarchy followed to finish things. The pure-blooded families that dominated France were broken by the half-blood Robespierre and his attempt to create one equal French nation, their fading influence was shattered by the devastation of Grindelwald. Britain has never weathered such change, its Ministry is still controlled by a handful of old families, and the prejudices and hatred of darker times remain beneath the surface of British society.\'

*He fears they will hate me because I am veela and not pure- blooded enough for a Potter.* Fleur huffed. *As if any of them are a better fit for him.*

\'Harry doesn't care,\' she said.

\'He's the heir to an esteemed pure-blooded family, over

time he will be exposed to and affected by those opinions.'

*The Delacours are descended from the Beaulieus, but it's a tenuous connection. Égalité, liberté, fraternité brought an end to such silly things.*

Papa studied his fingernails. 'And that's ignoring the rumours that are flying about him in Britain...'

Heat flooded Fleur's bones; feathers slid from her skin and her body boiled with liquid heat. \'They're *lies!*\'

*And I wouldn't care if they weren't.* Fleur bit her tongue. *I don't care what happens to shallow, little people. What do they expect to happen if they keep poking at a sleeping dragon?*

Papa winced. 'I'm just worried about your safety, ma cherie. Either Harry's not what he seems, or their Dark Lord has returned and The-Boy-Who-Lived will be his first target.\' He pulled a stern expression onto his face. \'I don't want my little girl hurt and if you're involved with Harry Potter, you'll be dragged into the chaos that surrounds him.\'

# Nobody Expects the High Inquisitor

Smoke rose up into the chimney, drawn in a faint swirl. The smell of burning pine filled the common room; the wood popped and crackled, spitting glowing sparks at the battered, dented bronze fire- guard. Harry rested his feet on the arm of the chair and stared into the flames. In the corner of his eye, he watched Hermione watching him over the top of her book.

Dean and Ron stumbled down the stairs, rubbing their eyes and yawning.

\'How was detention with Umbridge?\' Hermione asked. Ron grinned. \'Didn\'t you hear?\'

\'McGonagall cancelled it.\' Dean stuck both his thumbs up.

\'Apparently, she'd a blazing row with Umbridge on Friday about it.\'

*Interesting.* Harry kept his eyes on the fire. *She never cancelled any of the detentions I got from Snape, not even the ones for silent insubordination and malicious breathing.*

\'Yeah.\' Seamus bounded down the dormitory stairs. \'Umbridge can\'t give you detentions and dock points for trying to practice spells we\'ll be tested on this summer. That ain't fair. \'

*Idiots. Trying to practice their shield charms where Umbridge will catch them.* Harry shared a glance with Nev. *Hermione must've not explained things to them.*

\'Well, we\'ve got her again after breakfast,\' Hermione said. \'Try not to let her antagonise you into doing something she can actually give detention for.\'

\'Still can\'t believe McGonagall cancelled your punishments.\' Seamus shook his head. \'I heard Umbridge was absolutely furious. I bet she\'s even nastier than normal this morning. You should keep your heads down and stop standing up for *him*.\'

*Ah, that'll be me*. Harry rolled his eyes. *They're not even*

*standing up for me.*

Ron grunted. \'I\'m not defending him. I believe Dumbledore and I\'m sick of the rubbish that hag spouts at us every lesson.

Professor Lupin was our best teacher, nothing wrong with Hagrid, and Fleur Delacour was bloody hot and a champion for the tournament, even if she was kind of a bitch.\'

Harry buried a flicker of ire. *You don't know Fleur well enough to judge her. Not that it's stopped any of you before.*

\'Well, you should probably keep it to yourself, Ron,\' Hermione suggested. \'She\'s going to be going after anyone who appears to advocate Dumbledore\'s side. Harry\'s being very clever in not openly disagreeing with her, but still clearly opposing Umbridge.\'

Harry grinned. *It\'s nice to be appreciated.*

Nev nudged him, picking up his stuff and moving in the direction of breakfast. Harry tipped his head in the direction of the other Gryffindors and mouthed *Katie* at him.

*Hermione'll sort them out. If they need to practise, she'll organise something.* He leant back in the chair and tugged the cushion into the small of his back. *She can probably teach most of the spells if she has to.*

A dishevelled, bleary-eyed Katie plodded down the stairs from the girls' dormitories. Harry waved a couple of times until she stumbled over, smoothing her hair back.

\'Morning Harry,\' she grumbled. \'Are we going to breakfast now? You can tell me about wherever it was you went on holiday and finally got a bit of tan.\'

'France. And *I* was waiting for *you*,' he said.

\'Let\'s go, then.' She tugged at her uniform a few times, then

shrugged, and bounced toward the exit.

Harry swept his stuff up from beside his chair in the common room and squeezed out behind the portrait of the fat lady next to her. The first years clustered outside edged away from Harry as he stepped out.

Katie cackled. \'Ah, vulnerable children, *ripe* for sacrificing in dark rituals.\'

The firsties scattered back into the common room.

Harry grinned. \'You're not helping, Katie.'

\'If you become a Dark Lord, I\'m volunteering myself as Dark Lady,\' she said. \'I love watching them run.\'

\'I think you\'re likely to get immolated by someone talking like that,\' Harry quipped.

Katie froze midway through stalking toward a group of second year Hufflepuff students. 'Why would I be immolated by someone for being your Dark Lady?' She cocked her head. '*Harry?*'

*Fuck.* Harry hunted for a good reason.

'I mean, in order to protect my reputation, I'd have to do

something about you, and everyone knows fire kills evil things.'

Katie's brown eyes narrowed, then a wide grin appeared on her face. 'Lovely weather in *France,* Harry.' She sidled up to him and clutched his arm. 'I can think of another lovely thing about *France*, too...'

*Merde.* Harry's stomach churned and knotted itself.

Headlines of the summer's Daily Prophet articles flashed before his

eyes. *Nobody was meant to know.*

'Keep it to yourself, please.' He pried his arm loose, and took her hands in his. 'Seriously, Katie.'

'I will,' she murmured. 'But, in return, you have to let me come and sacrifice a few first years in dark rituals with you.'

Harry laughed and stepped into the Great Hall searching for

an empty space on the table. 'It's a date.'

'So much better than Madam Puddifoot's.' Katie beamed. 'Pink cushions don't really do it for me, but dark magic, now *that* gets me hot under the collar.'

\'Have I ever told you that I sometimes worry about you?\' Harry asked.

Katie slid onto the Gryffindor bench across from the Weasley twins. \'Oh, all the time.'

\'Morning, Dark Mistress.\' The twins bowed low over their breakfasts. \'What evil deeds have you planned for today?\'

\'She\'s been scaring the first years.\' Harry grinned and waved a hand toward the nervous huddle by the door. 'Look at them, they're so scared of her they don't want to risk walking past us to get breakfast.'

\'Ah.\' The leftmost twin sighed. \'That\'s our Katie, they won\'t be free from terror until the quidditch season starts.\'

\'It\'s about time Angelina sorted try-outs, don\'t you think?\' The rightmost twin spun his fork round in his hand. \'Maybe you should tell her?\'

\'Me?\' The leftmost wagged his finger. \'She\'s *your* girlfriend!\' \'You\'re quite right, George. That\'s why *you* have to tell her.\' \'Hush, idiots,\' Katie said. \'I\'ll remind her later.\'

\'Yes, Dark Mistress.\' They bowed again. Fred dipped the front of his robes in his eggs.

Katie giggled and helped herself to toast.

Harry monopolised the mushrooms, scattering them over his buttered toast. A ragged ball of grey wobbled past his head and collapsed onto the table in front of the twins. *Errol.* Harry gave the bird a gentle poke with the butt of his fork and gave it a piece of bacon.

The twins skimmed the letter. Their eyes slid down the page, flicking from side to side in unison, then they screwed their faces up in disgust. \'It\'s from Percy. Does anyone have a copy of the Daily Prophet?\'

Several papers appeared from all angles. They scanned the first few pages of the nearest, then tossed it across the table between Katie and Harry.

Katie plucked the paper off the table and glanced at the staff. 'Dolores Jane Umbridge, formerly Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and newly appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts

Professor at Hogwarts has, in a surprise move by the Wizengamot, become the first ever official to hold the freshly created position of High Inquisitor.'

Fred sniggered. \'Percy decided to offer us some advice on

the back of it.'

'How kind of him,' Harry muttered.

\'It\'s time to let trouble-making and running riot come to an end.' George adopted a fine, high falsetto. 'Things are changing and we must change with them.\'

Harry studied the rest of the article with a small ball of apprehension coiling in his gut. *I quite liked things as they were. Umbridge was drawing all the attention and making herself usefully unpopular without actually doing much damage. Now she's got some actual power to abuse.*

\'Have you read this?\' Katie shoved the paper further under his nose. \'The position of High Inquisitor, created by Educational Decree Number Twenty Three, also enjoys the ability to determine the sanctions scheme of Britain\'s education establishments courtesy of the following decree, number twenty four.'

\'She must've written to Fudge over the weekend about McGonagall overpowering her and rescinding her detentions,\' Harry said. \'Now we\'ve got this to deal with.\'

*This is because of Ron and Dean, if they\'d had some sense*

*and not been caught, this wouldn\'t've happened.*

\'This is ridiculous.\' Fred and George exchanged a long look. \'With that foul woman in charge of punishments who knows what will happen next.\'

*She'll throw anyone who speaks against the Ministry in detention, that's what will happen.* Harry hid a grimace. *If she's clever, she'll reserve the use of her power for situations in which it seems appropriate, but hopefully she'll be too zealous and just turn everyone further against her.*

Fred leant forward over his plate of eggs. \'Well, you know what this means, of course.\'

George pulled a serious expression on his face. \'I do indeed, brother mine. It means we will have to listen to Percy and... *not get caught!*\'

The pair grinned and split the remaining half of the toast rack between them.

\'You\'re incorrigible,\' Harry said. \'You really don\'t want to get

caught, though.'

\'We never get *caught*.\' Fred wagged his finger. \'We just get

*suspected*.\'

\'I don\'t think Umbridge is going to distinguish between suspects and culprits,\' Katie said, buttering two pieces of toast to make herself a bacon sandwich. \'She tried to get your younger brother and his friend put in detention for practicing spells that are in the Defence OWL. So be extra careful.\'

\'Yes, Dark Mistress,\' George chimed. 'We humbly obey.'

Katie beamed and looked down her nose at the Weasley

twins. 'As you should, lowly minions.'

Fred laughed. \'You\'re a bad influence, Harry. Look what you\'ve turned our innocent Katie into.\'

\'I did nothing.\' Harry raised his palms. \'She was like this underneath the whole time.\'

George gasped. \'Surely not. Not our Katie.\'

Fred shook his head. \'All those quidditch practice sessions in the rain. The times when she would lovingly hurl the quaffle at us until she got her way.\'

\'The threats to tell Angelina and Alicia if she didn\'t get what she wanted,\' George added.

\'No, Harry,' Fred said. \'I just can\'t believe it. I won\'t.\'

George brushed away fake tears. \'And then there was the time she drank fire whiskey after winning the quidditch cup and hid all our essential pranking supplies in Snape\'s office.'

\'No, that was us, George,\' Fred said. \'Katie hid all our pre- prepared essays in McGonagall\'s office.\'

\'Ah, yes.' George sighed. \'Sometimes it's hard to remember. She definitely warned the girls we\'d switched on our date with them, though.\'

\'You have a point, brother mine.\' Fred turned to Harry with a solemn expression. \'Harry, you might be right. We think Katie has been evil all along, after all.\'

Katie waved her butter-smeared knife at the pair. \'Don\'t you three have some classes to go to?\'

\'No.\' The twins grinned. \'We\'re free *all morning*.\'

\'Umbridge,\' Harry said. 'Sure to be an interesting lesson

today.'

\'You\'d probably best get going.\' Katie laughed. \'Don\'t want to be expelled for being late, do you?\'

Harry shot her a half-hearted glare, then helped himself to half her bacon sandwich in revenge. Katie huffed and tugged the remaining half close to her chest as he walked round her toward the exit.

*I wonder if Umbridge will up her game.* Harry drifted through the corridors. *I don't think she realises how unpopular she actually is.*

Nev lingered outside the classroom. Harry poked his head in and found Hermione, Ron, Dean, and Seamus practising their shield charms. A faint, almost invisible bubble of light surrounded Ron and a bright patch of light the size of Harry's palm hovered in front of Dean. A pink-faced Hermione demonstrated the wand action over and over again.

*Seems like it's going well.*

Harry stepped back out. \'Did they leave you outside to

guard?\'

\'I can already do the shield charm,\' Nev said.

\'Care to share?\' Harry glanced down the corridor. 'No

Umbridge yet.'

\'Protego,\' Nev commanded.

A glowing demi-sphere of translucent, silver light flickered into being around him.

*He's been practising.*

The light trembled, shivered, and the shield wavered. Small gaps drifted across its surface, then faded away, reappearing and disappearing upon the shining silver surface like rain ripples upon a pond.

*Not perfect yet, though.*

The distinctive click of Umbridge's pink heels echoed down the hall from 'round the corner.

Nev darted inside. 'She's coming!'

Harry wandered in and joined Nev at the back of the classroom. A handful of other students slipped in, then Umbridge swept into the room, her pink cardigan flaring out behind her like a cloak and her lurid handbag bouncing on her elbow.

\'Good morning, class.\' She set her handbag down and stared at them like a frog at a cluster of flies.

Silence smothered the room.

\'Now that won\'t do.\' The corners of her wide mouth turned down. \'That\'s not polite *at all*.\'

'Good morning, Professor Umbridge,' muttered the handful

of vulnerable-looking students at the front.

\'Today we will be continuing with our reading. Please turn to the next chapter and copy out all the relevant, key passages at the bottom of each page.\'

A low groan rippled round the room.

\'Anything that\'s not a picture a four year old could have drawn, then,' Nev muttered.

*The only use Slinkhard\'s worthless compilation of nonsense has in defence is if it's hurled at your opponent.* Harry propped his book up on the desk and arranged his things on the desk as if he was working. *And that's only because they printed it in hardback.*

\'I managed to get a copy of the curriculum off Hermione,\' Nev whispered when Umbridge turned away to loom over Dean and Seamus.

\'What does it say?\' Harry asked.

\'It says that if things carry on like this then the only ones who are going to even pass will be us and Hermione. There\'s a list of almost twenty spells you can be asked to demonstrate, of which the shield charm is one of the simplest, and Umbridge isn\'t going to be teaching us about any of them.\'

Harry smirked. 'She might have a change of heart.\'

\'We had a peek at her lesson plan when we got here.\' Nev made a small disgusted sound in the back of his throat.

\'That bad?\'

\'Once we've finished copying out every written word from *this*---\' a flicker of rage passed through Nev's eyes as he glanced down at the pages of the book '---he\'s going to teach us to run away from our problems.\'

\'You\'re serious?\'

\'Officially, it\'s called *conflict avoidance and fleeing*.\' Nev choked back a laugh. \'There\'s a bit on iguanas, too. I thought we\'d be free of those lizards once Quirrell was replaced and his pet was gone.\'

Harry let out a sigh. \'I miss that iguana. It used to escape and hide on top of the cupboards. Parvati was terrified of it.\'

Nev flushed. \'I was terrified, too.'

\'It was a big reptile, there\'s no reason to be ashamed.\' Harry

reached out and patted Nev on the cheek. 'There, there.'

Nev brushed his hand away. \'You\'ve been spending too long with Katie.\'

\'The first years are almost as scared of her as they are of me now,\' Harry said. \'Of course, they're not *that* scared of me, just a bit jumpy, but it's still quite an achievement, given I had to be accused of murder.' He glanced up at where Umbridge was supervising Ron writing the chapter title one stroke of a letter at a time. 'Can I have a look at that curriculum?\'

\'Here.\' Nev slipped a sheet of paper to Harry under the

table.

Umbridge let out a little titter. 'The title is most certainly *not*

A Hundred Ways to Let You-Know-Who Win, Mr Weasley*.* You- Know-Who has been dead for more than a decade. We'll have a very long discussion about it in detention.'

Harry dropped his eyes back to the recommended list of books. \'We can get some of these books out of the Room of Requirement. It'll be easy to learn them on our own up there and I can help you if you struggle with any of them.\'

\'Thanks.' Nev's eyes flicked up. 'Incoming,' he hissed, snatching the piece of paper off Harry's lap.

Pink heels clicked toward the back row.

*I'm not wasting my time writing any of this.* Harry glanced 'round, then knocked his ink pot over his blank parchment and made an extravagant show of trying to save his work.

Umbridge paused at the edge of his desk and a thick, cloying stench rolled over him. \'What *are* you doing, Mr Potter?\'

Harry held up the dripping piece of parchment and watched the ink trickle down the page and drip into the puddle on the desk. \'I spilt some ink, professor.\'

Umbridge tittered. \'How clumsy of you. You\'ll have to start again, won\'t you?\'

\'I know.\' Harry smothered a grin. \'Would you mind vanishing the ink for me, Professor Umbridge? I\'d do it myself, but I don\'t want to injure anyone by using magic in the *classroom*.'

She simpered. \'I\'m sure your attempt will be safe, Mr Potter, but I\'m glad you had the wisdom to ask for the approval of one more knowledgeable than yourself before attempting anything.'

\'If you\'re sure, professor.\'

*Hook, line, and sinker.* Harry clenched his jaw to keep his laugh from bubbling up. *And now it's going to be your fault.*

He raised his wand. 'Evanesco,' he said, banishing the ink off

the desk.

A spray of dark blue droplets spattered Umbridge's pink

cardigan and shoes.

\'Oh, professor,\' he gushed. \'I\'m so sorry.\' Harry raised his wand. \'Let me try again.\'

\'I think that\'s quite enough, Mr Potter.\' Umbridge's eyes burnt and her voice shook. \'Finish copying out the chapter, class. I\'m going to have to go and change.\'

Her heels clicked away and the door of the classroom thudded shut. The class burst into laughter.

\'That was brilliant, Harry,\' Neville grinned. \'Thank you.'

*One more barbed comment about part humans and how bad they are, and I might be tempted to do more than just cover her in ink.*

close.

The clock hands dragged round until the lesson came to a

Harry trailed Nev, Hermione, and Ron back to the common

room. Nev waved the curriculum at the pair and they descended into a dispute of fierce whispers.

\'Why can\'t you act more like Harry does, then?\' Hermione prodded Ron in the chest. 'You don't see him in detention every day and the Ministry's trying to convince everyone he's a murderer.'

\'Because she deliberately tries to get me in trouble,\' Ron spat. \'It\'s not even close to fair.\'

\'Well you should just ignore her.\' Hermione sighed. \'Now you have to have detention with her and I bet she comes up with something horrible for you.\'

\'MimbulusMimbletonia,\' Nev said to the Fat Lady, who swung aside for them all to enter the common room.

\'We can\'t just let her get away with spouting all that nonsense,\' Ron grumbled. \'She\'s poisoning the students against Dumbledore and when You-Know-Who attacks he\'ll take everyone by surprise. We won\'t even be able to defend ourselves because she just wants us to run away and won't teach us any magic.\'

\'So we practise the spells on our own.' Nev slumped into

the sofa.

Ron and Hermione joined him. Harry lingered, tossing his

empty ink pot into the common room bin.

\'We tried that,\' Ron said. \'We\'ll just get detentions and now she\'s in control of them. McGonagall can\'t overrule her.\'

\'So don\'t get caught.\' Nev shrugged. \'I know somewhere we can go she won\'t find us.\'

Hermione chewed at her lip. \'Where?\'

\'It\'s on the seventh floor,\' Nev said. \'You can cast all the defensive magic you want there and she\'ll never know if we don\'t want her to.\'

\'Will you help us with our Shield Charms?\' Hermione asked.

'Yours is pretty good.'

Ron laughed. \'I never thought I\'d see you asking Neville for help, Hermione, but seriously, Nev, will you?\'

\'Y-yeah.\' Nev bobbed his head. \'I\'ll try. W-we can go now if you want?\'

\'Let\'s do it.\' Ron clapped Nev on the shoulder. \'We can grab Dean and Seamus from the Great Hall on the way.\'

*If they're all out, then I can talk to Sirius.* Harry drifted up to the dormitories. *That mirror sounds like it works a lot like the necklace Fleur made for me.*

He pulled the mirror out of the bottom of his trunk. \'Sirius,\' Harry whispered.

\'Harry.' Sirius' grey eyes brightened. \'You took your time?\'

\'I\'ve been busy,\' Harry said. \'Are you still safe under Dumbledore\'s Fidelius Charm?\'

\'Yes.\' Sirius scowled. \'I\'m tucked up all safe and sound in this awful, dirty house where I can\'t do anything that might alert the Ministry to my location.\'

Harry chuckled. \'At least you\'re safe. No dementors in there, are there?\'

\'Had a boggart and a whole flock of doxies to get rid of when Remus helped me tidy some parts up over the summer, but for the large part this house is mostly danger free. Just as long as you remember not to go in the library or to touch anything in a glass display case.\' Sirius' face darkened. 'Still hate this place, though.

Nothing good ever happened here.'

\'What kind of house are you in?\' Harry asked. 'And what happened there?'

\'The home of a most ancient and noble family.\' Sirius' grin didn't quite reach his eyes. \'I can\'t tell you much about it, obviously, but I can tell you that the Order of the Phoenix is using it as its headquarters. Only useful thing I\'ve been able to do.'

\'I have no idea what the Order of the Phoenix is,\' Harry said.

\'You don\'t?\' Sirius' brow creased. \'Why haven\'t you been told? Your father, mother, Remus, and I were all part of it in the last war. It\'s a group Dumbledore started to oppose the Death-Eaters in ways the Ministry can\'t.\'

*Dumbledore\'s followers. Makes sense he has his own secret group. Snape must be one of them.*

\'What did it do?\' Harry asked. 'I've not talked to Dumbledore

for ages.'

\'Mostly we warned the Ministry of where attacks would come and guarded places of crucial importance, but right now we\'re trying to make sure the Ministry opens its eyes before it\'s too late. Well, all the other members are, I just sit around here disposing of dangerous artefacts and priceless family heirlooms.' A distant look crept across his face and a small smile appeared on his lips. 'One day, I\'m going to get that abomination of a portrait, too.'

Harry laughed. \'Sounds fun.' \'So why've you been so busy?\'

\'The Ministry appointed Dolores Umbridge as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She\'s here to make sure we don\'t learn anything useful and to try and undermine support for Dumbledore in Britain\'s next generation of students.' Harry shot Sirius a sharp smile. 'I\'m making her life difficult.'

\'I\'ve heard of her.\' Sirius\' face twisted. \'She\'s a half-blood obsessed with trying to be as pure as possible. Hates magical creatures, non-humans, muggles, and anyone who associates with them. Umbridge's personally responsible for some of the most bigoted pieces of legislation ever to pass through the Wizengamot, including a law that makes it all but impossible for Remus to get a job anywhere.\'

A small ball of ice tightened beneath Harry's ribs. \'I know

how much she hates anyone she believes to be less than human.\'

\'Be careful of her, Harry,\' Sirius said. \'She\'s only a half- blood, but still managed to rise quickly through the ranks of the Ministry from obscurity to a position that\'s never been held by anything other than a pure-blood before. Fudge is a bumbling idiot incapable of seeing beyond his own aspirations as Minister, but Umbridge is a nasty, slippery piece of work with connections in all the wrong corners of the Wizengamot.\'

\'Duly noted.\' Harry grinned. \'So openly embarrassing her in front of a whole class would be a bad idea?\'

Sirius struggled with a smile. \'What did you do?\'

\'I spilt ink everywhere and when I tricked her into giving me permission to try and vanish it, I sprayed it all over her instead.'

Sirius roared with laughter. \'Good one, Harry.\'

\'She didn\'t look very happy with me, but I did nothing

wrong.\'

Sirius managed to suppress his smile. \'It was a bad idea.

Best to keep your head down until things get straightened out with the Ministry. We don\'t need to make things worse than they are.\'

\'I\'ll stay out of sight as much as I can,\' Harry said. 'Plenty of stuff for me to quietly do.'

A loud thud echoed from Sirius\' side of the mirror and a horrible shrieking started up in the background.

\'I have to go,\' Sirius said. \'Use the mirror whenever you want. I\'ve nothing else to do around here except try and think of new ways to destroy that painting.\'

\'Bye, Sirius.\' Harry held the mirror further away and waved goodbye.

\'Shut up, you mad old hag,\' Sirius roared as the mirror faded back to normal.

*Perhaps I should ask him to tell me how he gets rid of the painting. It could be useful for figuring out how to strip away some of the more annoying enchantments on Slytherin\'s frame.*

# Black Swan

Light poured through bright-painted walls. She ran over creaking, polished wooden floorboards and thick, soft rugs as the old pictures laughed and smiled from above. A cool weight squished between her forearms and her chest.

'Stop running, Bell!' Cissy toddled in her wake. Her blonde curls trailed down her back and blotches of water spotted her dark- grey dress. 'We need to get Andi *together.*'

Bell paused and cocked her head. 'Ok, itty bitty baby Cissy.' 'I'm *not* an itty bitty baby!' Cissy waved her chubby fists in the

air. 'You're an itty bitty baby, Bell.'

'Hush,' Bell whispered. She grabbed a globe of water from her arms and dropped it into Cissy's. 'There, now you've got one, too.

Andi's hiding up here, she always hides up here between the two clocks.'

Cissy shook the globe of water in her hands and watched the

bubbles swoosh through it. 'Andi always wins,' she moaned.

'Not this time.' Bell leant into Cissy's ear. 'I climbed up the clock and moved the old shelf from on top. Now, we can throw water over the top when she hides there. You go first, then if you miss, I'll get her instead.'

Cissy stumbled over the rugs toward the door at the end of the corridor, giggling under her breath. Her bare feet pattered on the wood, then padded on the rugs.

Bell bounced after her. 'I'm a -- I'm a -- I'm a... weird sister. I'm a -- I'm a -- I'm a... weird sister. I'm a -- I'm a -- I'm a... weird sister,' she murmured.

Cissy darted through the door toward the clock and hurled her globe of water at the gap between them. It burst on the clock's edge spraying it and its twin with water. Andi's quiet giggle rang out from the dark in between the two clocks.

Cissy wailed. 'I missed!'

Bell tip-toed past the top of the stairs and behind the vases and sculptures, creeping along the balustrade, clutching the last water globe in her hand. The flared wings of the stuff griffon blocked her path.

*Stupid griffon. I forgot you're in the way.* Bell scrambled up on top of the balustrade and ooched along it until she could see past the griffon's wingtips.

Andi poked her head out, then splatted her globe of water

right on top of Cissy's blonde curls. 'Got you!' she sang.

Cissy burst into tears. 'You ruined my hair.'

'Aww.' Andi stepped out from between the clocks and swept Cissy into a hug, squashing her face into the front of her blue dress. 'It's ok baby Cissy, Bell and I will curl your hair again a little bit later.'

Cissy's tears slowed. 'Bell will get your hair all wet, too.' She squirmed out of Andi's hug and looked around. 'Where's Bell?'

Andi froze, then snatched her other water globe out from

between the clocks. 'Bell's here?' 'Got you!'

Bell hurled her globe. It burst against Andi's shoulder as she spun and threw. Andi's water globe sailed up past the griffon's wing and struck Bell in the chest. The balustrade slipped away from beneath her. Andi's horrified, pale face vanished beyond it and Cissy's scream rang in Bell's ears. She clutched for the marble railing, but her fingers flailed through the air.

The floor flashed up from below and a desperate shriek tore from her throat.

Bella jolted awake on the ice-cold stone floor of her cell. *I want to play with my sisters again.* She stared out through the frosted iron bars at the dark sky and distant stars. *I hate this place. It's boring. I want to leave.* Hot tears trickled down her face. *I just want to play with Cissy and Andi again.*

'We have to leave if we want to play, Bella.' Bella smeared her tears away and stared at the bright, violet glow of her eyes in the shining wall of the cell. 'But we can't use our trump card just for that. We'll get out of here soon, anyway, then we can go see Cissy and Andi.'

*It'll be just like before, Bella.* Her reflection stared back, all long, tangled, matted curls, pale, grime-smeared skin, and yellow teeth. *We look terrible. Cissy and Andi will tease us.*

She cocked her head. A thick, dense quiet lay over the cells;

it curled 'round her and closed over her head like water.

'I don't want to be in this silly room anymore.' Bella huffed and slapped her fist on the floor. Fire seared through her blood and curled 'round her heart. 'I hate it.'

A ripple of air burst from within her and tore the door off its

hinges; it thudded into strange boy's cell door, then to the ground.

Bella giggled. 'Oops. I broke the door again.' She jumped up and skipped out into the corridor. 'I'm a -- I'm a -- I'm a... weird sister. I'm a -- I'm a -- I'm a... weird sister. I'm a -- I'm a -- I'm a... weird sister.'

Strange boy groaned. 'Bella, what have you done?'

She laughed and spun herself round until the old, frosted, cracked stones of the corridor blurred. 'I broke the door again, strange boy.'

His face appeared beyond the bars of his door. 'Are you escaping?'

*We can't escape like this, Bella. The guards overwhelm us*

*when they're in groups.*

'No.' Bella twirled in circles in the corridor. 'I just don't want to be in there. I want to do something fun.'

Strange boy stared at her with an odd gleam in his eye. 'I'm going back to sleep, then. Try and be quiet.'

'Ok!' She skipped down the corridor past the iron doors and the thick columns of runes scored into them. 'I can't remember where this goes, Bell. Let's go this way!'

She followed the breeze, chasing the sporadic flutter of cold that swept through the tatters of her black dress. It led her past empty cells, angling up a steep slope in a square spiral until it flattened out into a wide corridor before a thick pair of double iron doors.

*That's the way out, Bella.* Bella cocked her head and studied the runes etched into the metal. *It's tough, though.* Her fingers crept to the waist of her dress. *I need my wand, Bell. It's no fun without it.*

She poked her head into the cells on her left, shoving the doors wide open with loud screeches. She bounced back off the fourth and stumbled back.

'Move!' Bella huffed and threw her shoulder into the cell door.

Pain flared through her arm. Her blood boiled. 'Ow! Nasty door!'

The door crumpled with a metallic screech and thudded to the ground. A thin-framed, white-haired man peered up at her from where he huddled in the far corner with his arms wrapped 'round his legs.

'Who're you?' Bella asked. 'I'm Bella. *Just* Bella.'

'Thaddeus,' the man croaked. 'Are you here to break me out?

It's been so long, I thought everyone'd forgotten me.' He clawed himself up on the wall. 'Did we win? For the greater good?'

*Grindelwald's motto, Bella.* She cocked her head. *Oh yeah. I remember, Bell.*

'Nope!' She giggled. 'Grindelwald lost *ages* ago. I just wanted

to see what was behind the door.'

'We lost?' Thaddeus' voice cracked. 'We *lost!*' He slid back down the wall and wrapped his arms rounds his legs. 'We lost. How could we lose? How?'

Bella shrugged and danced out. 'Same way everyone loses.

They die.'

A dementor floated out from the cell opposite. Its hood flared and it swooped toward her, breath rattling and withered fingers groping for her neck. The cold seeped into Bella. Fragments of Andi's terrified face welled up into her thoughts and Cissy's scream echoed in Bella's ears.

'Shoo!' She stamped her foot.

It drifted closer.

Bella flapped her hand at it. 'Go away!'

The dementor's hood shivered. It took a long rattling breath as

the frost upon the floor thickened and spread.

*How do I get rid of it?*

Bella huffed and pointed a finger into the cell. 'Fetch.'

The dementor slid through the air toward her.

'Don't ignore me!' Heat bubbled through Bella's blood. 'That's

*rude!'*

A faint shimmer swept out from within her, tossing the

dementor back against the wall. It shook itself like a dog, then rose up off the floor. The dark hood swung back and forth between Bella and the door to the cell.

'Fetch,' Bella commanded. 'Don't be *bad*.'

The dementor swooped past her; its hood slipping back from its face to reveal grey skin and a gaping maw. A thin, hollow scream ripped out of Thaddeus' mouth, then silence fell.

Bella giggled. 'Good floating skeleton.' She skipped along and prodded the iron doors with her fingers. Small white sparks crawled across the metal. 'Aw[www.](http://www/) Can't get through that.'

*Not without our wand, Bella.*

'I guess we'll have to wait, then, Bell.' She ran a finger down

the serpent on her arm. It writhed beneath her skin and turned a little

darker. Bella laughed and skipped back past the dementor and the glass-eyed old man lying beneath it. 'Won't be long now!'

# Ice Ice Baby

White sparks showered down around Harry, spattering across the stone floor and sputtering out.

Salazar's green eyes tracked him through the rain of glowing specks. \'You told me you wanted to learn about legilimency, not those silly little hexes and jinxes you\'ve been practising all this time.'

\'I need to know them for my OWL exams at the end of the year and to be able to teach Nev, since our current teacher is more interested in keeping us helpless and under the sway of the Ministry.\' Harry shrugged. 'Might as well get them done now and out of the way.'

\'None of them are even *remotely* useful,\' Salazar said. \'Why use something like that Impedimenta Jinx when you know how to splinter bones?\'

Harry raised an eyebrow at the painting. \'Because if I use the bone-splintering curse in my exam I\'m likely to fail it.'

\'This school has gone downhill,\' Salazar griped. \'I blame the Ministry. Tom said they were created to uphold the Statute of Secrecy that keeps our worlds separate and safe, not restrict the types of magic wizard and witches can use or learn about.\'

\'Umbridge's rants about subhuman creatures won\'t last long.\' Harry allowed himself a small smile. 'Voldemort cursed the position she\'s holding, nobody\'s ever lasted a whole year, and she\'s made enemies of the entire school, Dumbledore, and myself.\'

\'You\'re part of the school,\' Salazar said. 'You counted yourself twice.'

\'So's Dumbledore and I\'m quite a bit more dangerous than

your average fifth year,\' Harry said.

\'You\'re more dangerous than any other student here since

Tom.'

Harry grinned. \'All the more reason not to have to worry

about Umbridge being here for more than a year.'

\'You have plenty of other things to worry about,\' Salazar muttered. \'That prophecy, Voldemort, Dumbledore, the Ministry.\' Salazar's serpent bobbed its head every time he added another problem until Salazar fixed it with a black glare. \'And that\'s just the big ones you know about.\'

\'I\'ll figure it out. I have a plan.\'

Salazar scoffed. 'No you don't. Your *plan* is some beautiful sunset on the horizon and a whole lot of determination to get to it. Voldemort is biding his time while he gathers his strength, but he\'ll soon be back to trying to kill you, probably because of that prophecy, and Dumbledore will be doing his utmost to make sure he\'s successful. No doubt he thinks you\'ll make a great sacrifice and an even better martyr.'

\'All the more reason to master the Impedimenta Jinx,\' Harry

quipped.

Salazar's eyes flashed. 'Oh yes, I'm sure that will prove very

useful in a duel against Voldemort.'

Harry held up his hands. \'I\'m finished with them. I can perform them all well enough. An hour well spent.\'

\'Then it\'s time you learned about legilimency. No heir of mine will be anything less than a master of it and you don\'t have long left before you need to leave.\'

\'You were a whole lot more agreeable before I brought that enchanted clock,\' Harry muttered. 'Now I've got a giant, painted, slave-driving secretary.'

\'Have you thought of a way to practice your legilimency?\'

*Not really.*

\'I\'ve had a couple of ideas, but nothing particularly practical

yet.'

\'What have you come up with?\'

\'I considered using it on someone who\'s asleep or stunned,\'

Harry said.

Salazar shook his head. \'If they\'re stunned, they won\'t be thinking much about anything, and there\'s not a lot a novice can do with a sleeping mind. I suppose it would give you some practice of using the spell and might help you learn to control how much magic you put into it, but beyond that it\'s mostly useless. There would be no practice of actually confronting a defended mind.\'

\'I could find someone to attack?\' Harry suggested. 'Someone

nobody would listen to?'

\'Very bad idea,\' Salazar snapped. \'What if they know how to repel you? Legilimency is a very rare skill, but occlumency's probably known at a very basic level by a fair few, since it helps with magic in general.'

'I could offer to teach Nev occlumency. I could practice

legilimency and he could learn something useful in return.'

'That might be useful,\' Salazar said. 'As long as he keeps your ability to use legilimency a secret\... And you don't melt his brain.'

Harry raised an eyebrow. 'I'm fairly sure you can't do that with legilimency.'

'Not *physically*. A master legilimens, or a rash and powerful novice, can rearrange or create a lot of mental associations. That can change the entire way you think.'

'So what can you teach me?' Harry asked. 'This isn\'t like the blood magic where you could only teach me the principles, is it?'

Salazar's eyes darkened. 'I haven\'t taught you half of what

you need to know about blood magic before the end of this year. After legilimency, that\'s next.'

'And legilimency?'

'I am a little limited in how much I can teach you,' Salazar murmured. 'But I can tell you how it works in as much detail as possible.'

'I know you form a connection and can then somehow follow emotions,' Harry said.

'From when Voldemort managed to use it on you?' Salazar's brow creased. 'What did he manage to see?'

'Nothing particularly important, no more than I glimpsed from him.'

'Then it doesn\'t matter. You and Tom are similar enough that

you will likely come to understand each other well anyway.' Salazar

stroked his goatee. 'The spell forms the connection, allowing you to see anything that\'s currently on the mind of the victim. What Voldemort did requires a very strong connection. He latched onto one particular feeling and dissected it, glimpsing some of the memories and thoughts that are associated with it.'

'How can I do it?'

'If your will is stronger or you can make sure that your

opponent can\'t clear their thoughts so you\'re unchallenged. Legilimency is one of those branches of magic that comes down to some quite plain principles, but can be applied in an infinite number of complex ways.'

'Your favourite kind,' Harry muttered.

'Exactly.' Salazar rearranged his serpent back onto his shoulders. 'You need to practice casting the spell to get the hang of the scale over which it can be cast. The more magic, the stronger the connection. Occluding the mind actually has no effect on the connection itself, simply rendering it meaningless, but you can be expelled by strength of will. Similar to throwing off the Imperius Curse, if their intent to get you out of their head is stronger than your intent to be in it, then the connection will be broken.'

'So lots of magic makes the connection hard to break, but doesn\'t affect how much I can actually see. And obviously lots of magic requires strong intent.'

'Perfect.' Salazar nodded and patted the blunt nose of his serpent. \'Once you\'ve got the hang of casting it, you can work on casting it without a wand or an incantation, and then with as little eye contact as possible. The intricacies of legilimency all come once the connection has been made.'

asked.

'What about after the connection has been created?' Harry

'Much more complicated.' Salazar cracked a broad grin.

'Every wizard does it differently because we all think slightly differently to each other. The goal is to get your victim to think about what you want to know so you can then see it. A simple goal, with many complex methods. You can do it by showing them images, your own memories and thoughts, or by following and dissecting theirs like Voldemort tried to do to you. That\'s why practice is so important, you need to learn to create your own style and tactics.'

'So teaching Nev to try and protect a secret while I learn

how to get it out of him is a good idea?' Harry asked.

'As long as you trust him or are prepared to use the memory charm on him repeatedly,' Salazar said.

*The only other options are Katie or Fleur, but Katie won't want to learn Occlumency, so she doesn't get anything out of it, and I can't risk hurting Fleur.* Harry grimaced and a little knot tightened in his gut. *Otherwise I can only try and cast it on myself.*

\'Can you use legilimency on yourself?\'

Salazar ran his fingers through his neat goatee. \'Why would you want to?\'

\'To see how well I can occlude my mind, of course.'

\'I don\'t know,' Salazar murmured. \'What an intriguing possibility. You could use the time-turner so you had a version of yourself to attack and defend, or you could try and create a connection from your mind to itself. I've no idea what might happen!\'

\'Perhaps it\'s best not to try, in case I make a mess of something important,\' Harry suggested.

Salazar's face fell. \'But we *have* to know. Try with the time- turner, you\'d be expecting yourself and not affecting anything too much so it won\'t do anything too terrible, and if it does you can leave yourself a warning by going back and warning yourself not to do it.\'

\'I\'m not doing that unless I\'m very desperate,\' Harry said. \'It sounds like a great way to kill myself twice in the same moment or to get stuck in some ridiculous time loop. I don't think I like the idea of being stuck in some kind of silly loop, it'd drive me mad.\'

*\'Fine*.\' Salazar crossed his arms. \'Waste the chance to discover something incredible.\'

Harry folded his arms and stared back. \'I *will*.'

Salazar glanced at the clock. \'You need to go back to

Gryffindor Tower.'

\'So I do,\' Harry said. \'It\'s almost time for Quidditch practice.\'

*Which I apparently have to be there for, even though I'm not*

*trying out.*

\'Before you go,\' Salazar said. \'Make sure you only portkey in or out to France from within my chamber.\'

\'Why?\' Harry quirked an eyebrow. 'I only ever have, but what difference does it make?'

\'The school\'s wards inform the headmaster the moment a student leaves when they aren\'t supposed to. The chamber is a loophole. You move outside of the wards, which is recorded, but you don\'t actually leave the castle, so they aren\'t triggered to alert the

headmaster.\' A small smile spread over Salazar's face. \'So you can leave from here and Dumbledore won\'t know you\'ve left unless he actually goes to check you\'re still at Hogwarts.\'

\'That\'s how he knew I could apparate,\' Harry said. \'He saw I had a new wand and realised I must've gone to Diagon Alley, so he checked to see if I had left. If he ever looks he\'ll be able to see every time I\'ve gone to France this year.\'

\'Yes. Don\'t give him a reason to check, Harry. The only time periods he can\'t check are those he wasn\'t headmaster for.\'

\'Does he know about the loophole of the Chamber of Secrets?\' Harry asked.

\'There are only three wizards who know any of the secrets of this place and Dumbledore is not one of them,\' Salazar said.

\'As long as he doesn\'t have a reason to look for when I\'ve

left I\'ll be fine.'

*Not that it changes anything. If Dumbledore wants to ask me where I'm going, I just won't tell him.* Harry headed toward the exit.

\'Practice your legilimency,\' Salazar shouted. 'And hang me back up on the wall.'

'Tell me how to take the charms off so I can levitate you!'

Harry paused at the foot of the steps and glanced back.

Salazar folded his arms and turned his back. 'No.'

Harry snorted and leapt up the stairs. 'Have it your way,

then.'

Dry, clean white tiles stretched across the floor of Myrtle's

quiet bathroom.

*She must be roaming the plumbing.* Harry chuckled to himself and headed back to the common room beneath his disillusionment charm. *Like a much less terrifying version of the basilisk.*

Nev and his newfound following of devoted pupils occupied the sofas by the fire, locked in deep discussion over half a dozen open books. Harry recognised their titles from the defence against the dark arts curriculum list. Colin Creevey snoozed in the only other chair.Harry prodded the sleeping boy in the leg with his foot. Colin remained still as stone.

*Well, Salazar said to practice. I owe Creevey for all those photos in the second year anyway.*

Harry slipped his wand tip out of his sleeve. \'Legilimens,\' he murmured.

He plunged into a stream of broken images. Scattered snapshots of taking photos for the Daily Prophet, passing his exams and writing an exposé on Umbridge. Harry tried to concentrate on the hatred swirling through a scatter of images of Umbridge. He glimpsed snatches of her office, a horrible, pink-draped room with china-decorated walls, a glimpse of a black-feathered quill, and red smeared upon the back of his hand.

Harry broke the connection and cast it again, reducing the magic little by little until he got only the merest hint of Colin's dream. *That's a start.* He tucked his wand further up his sleeve.

\'Harry!\' Katie bounced across the common room floor. \'It\'s try-outs time!\'

\'Then why aren\'t you in your quidditch gear?\' Harry asked.

\'We\'re only really trying out for a keeper. Angelina is keeping the old guard together, so we don\'t have to compete, just help judge.\' Katie tugged at his arm. \'Let\'s go, we can watch from the stands with everyone else.\'

\'I don\'t actually get to fly if I come, though, do I?\'

\'No, but I want you to come and you aren\'t doing anything

here.\'

Harry rolled his eyes. \'Fine.\'

She grabbed his wrist with warm fingers and pulled him out

of the common room and down the stairs. First and second years scattered from her path like leaves in the wind.

'Here we go!' Katie slowed to a walk as they approached the

edge of the quidditch pitch.

The Weasley twins knocked a bludger back and forth between them while Angelina and Alicia shouted over the top of a huddle of Gryffindors. A handful of Slytherins played a half-game at the far end of the pitch with a single bludger and the quaffle.

Harry glanced around for a glint of gold. *No snitch.*

\'Harry, Katie.\' Angelina waved them over. \'You\'re a little late, but we\'re still waiting for Ron Weasley, anyway.\'

\'Where is he?\' Alicia asked.

\'He's got detention with Umbridge.\' Ginny\'s voice piped up

from within the huddle. 'Hey, Harry.'

Harry eased his wrist out of Katie's grasp and gave the

huddle a wave.

\'Well, we\'ll start with chaser trials, then,\' Angelina said. \'Ginny, since you\'re the only one who wants to try out for seeker and chaser, you can join this first. You\'ll be the reserve seeker either way. Harry\'s first and there\'s nobody else who wants to play there for some reason.\'

Katie beamed. \'They probably think Harry will murder them for trying to steal his spot on the team.'

\'If anyone wants Katie\'s place, I\'ll happily murder her,\' Harry

offered.

She pouted. 'Won't you miss me?' Harry grinned. 'Nope.'

'Mean,' Katie murmured. 'A good thing I know you're lying.'

\'Get in the sky.\' Angelina produced a whistle from the

pocket of her robes. \'Murder's only acceptable if you\'re the captain.\'

The five potential chasers kicked off and began to swerve through a series of drills. Harry took a seat on the edge of the stands with Katie and the other members of last year\'s team.

\'What do you think, Alicia?\' Angelina asked. \'Weasley\'s good,\' Alicia said. \'The others are reserve

material, nobody\'s losing their spot today.\'

\'I agree,\' Katie added.

\'Kirke, Sloper, grab that bludger off those two idiots.'

Angelina gestured at her boyfriend and his twin. \'Show us what you

can do. Ten shots. As many hits on the edge of the ring as possible while your partner hits the bludger back at you.\'

They nodded and took off. The Weasley twins knocked the bludger up into the sky and tossed them the bats, then wandered across.

\'They\'re not bad.\' The twin beside Angelina watched the pair knocking the bludger into the edge of the hoop.

*Probably Fred, given he's sitting with Angelina.*

\'Almost as good as us,\' the one next to Alicia said.

\'Not as handsome, though. What do you think, Angelina?\'

\'Shouldn\'t you be asking Alicia, George?\' Angelina's tone

was dry as desert sand.

George gasped. \'Can\'t you tell us apart?!\' \'Yes,\' Alicia and Angelina answered. \'Oh.\' The pair looked quite crestfallen.

Katie laughed. 'No more date switching for you two.'

Ron stumbled across the pitch to join them. \'Sorry.' His chest heaved as he fought to get his breath back. \'Umbridge\'s detention ran on longer than I thought and she wouldn\'t let me leave until I was done.\'

\'Get in the air, Weasley,\' Angelina said. \'You\'re not late yet, we haven\'t started tryouts for keeper yet.\'

Ron grinned and swung a leg over his broom.

Harry glimpsed a gleam of crimson smeared across the back of his hand. *Just like Colin.* He watched Ron fly, but his robes covered his arm. A little ice crept into his blood. *It can't be a coincidence; it must be Umbridge. And she's got legal control of all the punishments now.*

The Slytherin game drifted near to the tryouts, sweeping through the chaser drills.

\'Oi!\' Angelina yelled. \'Get out of our half of the pitch.\'

One of the beaters, Harry recognised the distinctive profile of one of Crabbe or Goyle, spun and hammered the bludger down at them. It hissed out of the sky and crunched into Katie's side. Her face turned white as a sheet and a groan slipped through her clenched teeth.

'Katie,' Alicia cried.

Fred and George banished the bludger back. It smashed Crabbe off his broom as the Slytherin team flew down. He bounced twice across the grass, his broom snapping under him like a rotten branch, and he rolled to a stop, curling into a ball.

Harry slipped his wand out. 'Redeo,' he murmured.

Katie gasped, tears springing up in her eyes. 'No, Harry,' she moaned. 'Don't try and fix it, take me to Madam Pomfrey.'

He helped Katie to her feet.

Malfoy landed in front of them. 'You\'ll pay for that Weasley\'s,' he snapped.

'You\'ll pay for hitting that bludger at Katie!' Angelina

shouted.

'That was an *accident*.' Malfoy glanced at where Katie clutched her ribs, and shrugged. \'What those two blood-traitors did was deliberate. Professor Snape will see you in detention for the rest of the year at the very least. Personally, I\'m hoping you\'ll just be expelled.'

A tight point of ice formed in Harry's chest. 'Shut up and disappear, Malfoy,' he snapped.

\'Is that a threat, Potter?\' Malfoy sneered, his hand flashing to his wand. \'Are you going to try to kill me like you killed Krum?\'

\'What is going on here?\' Umbridge\'s high, girlish voice carried across the pitch. \'I've never seen such a display of aggression at this school. Mr Weasley and Mr Weasley, you will serve two weeks detention for your unprovoked attack on a fellow student.' A broad, smug smile spread across her pallid face and a bright gleam shone in her mud-brown eyes. \'Since you cannot be trusted to play this sport, I\'m afraid I will have to ban you both from playing.\'

\'You can\'t do that,\' Angelina cried. \'He *attacked* Katie.\' \'For life,\' Umbridge said. \'And I know what I saw, Miss

Johnson.\'

Harry took some more of Katie's weight and led her round

Malfoy toward the hospital wing.

\'I told you you'd pay.' Malfoy sniggered and stepped off his broom into their way. 'Now you've got no chance of winning, not with this delusional psycho playing seeker...' He sneered at Katie. 'Nobody will notice Bell being injured, though.'

\'Aguamenti,\' Harry hissed, slashing his wand at Malfoy.

A thick stream of water shot from the tip of his wand, striking Malfoy on the shoulder and knocking him off his feet. Malfoy screamed and squirmed in the dirt. Red clouded the water puddling beneath him on the ground as he writhed and clutched at the thick, jagged shards of ice that stuck from the deep, open slices on his torso. Malfoy whimpered and crawled away through the grass and mud. Ice protruded through his tattered quidditch jersey like pieces of broken glass.

\'Mr Potter,\' Umbridge breathed. \'You\'re also banned for life.\'

*That\'s it? Did she forget about detention? Expulsion?* Harry took a deep breath and tucked his wand away. *Dumbledore must still be the only one who can expel students. Otherwise I'd be gone.*

\'What have you got to say for yourself, Mr Potter?\' Umbridge demanded.

Harry led Katie toward the hospital wing. She wrapped her arms round his waist and clung to him, letting out little gasps and hisses with each step.

\'That was stupid,' Katie whispered.

\'I know,\' Harry said. \'I shouldn\'t have lost my temper.\'

'I can think of a certain *someone* who's going to be twice as angry with you as anybody here.\' She let out a weak laugh, then grimaced and moaned. 'Ow. I think my ribs are broken. Can we stop for a moment?'

*They're definitely broken. That hit you as hard as Dobby's*

*bludger hit me.*

Harry paused and let her lean on him. 'Why twice?'

*Fleur won't be too mad, will she?* He touched a fingertip to the necklace. *Oh. No. They'll write about it in all the papers and her parents will see. Fleur's going to be furious.*

'You did something stupid.' Katie giggled, then winced. 'And

you did it because *I* got hurt.'

'I\'ll blame you,' Harry said. 'Then Fleur will come and set you on fire instead of me. Now hush, you need to see Madam Pomfrey, I don't think talking and moving your ribs is helping.'

'My chest hurts *lots* when I breathe,' Katie murmured. 'Madam Pomfrey will fix it.' Harry smiled. 'She regrew all

the bones in my arm after Lockhart vanished them, she can manage

to fix some ribs.'

'You can always have a look first.' Katie giggled and motioned to her chest. 'No seashell bra, though.'

Harry laughed. 'No thanks, Katie.'

A wounded expression crossed her face. 'Ouch. Not even a

joke or a gentle let down.'

'Fleur,' he said. 'If you think she's going to be angry over this, you can only imagine how mad she'd be if she heard about us doing something like that, even as a joke.'

*There'd be fire. Probably lots of fire*. *And she'd leave. If I hurt her like that, she'd go all proud and walk away.* A horrible emptiness clawed its way back up from where Harry'd buried it. He shuddered. *She'd be gone forever.*

'I\'m not pretty enough for you, Harry.' Katie giggled. 'I\'m

glad you\'re my friend again. I enjoy scaring the firsties with you.'

'You\'re the one who does all the scaring.' Harry swept her legs out from underneath her and carried her into the hall toward the infirmary. 'I just stand there.'

'It\'s still fun,' Katie murmured, burying her head in his shoulder. 'I don't think Fleur would like you carrying me like this, either.'

*No. She'd understand, though. As long as she knew why.* A cold trickle of dread slid down his spine. *Which the Daily Prophet and Rita Skeeter certainly won't help with if they get a photo somehow.* Harry disillusioned them both.

Katie laughed and groaned. 'Are we there yet?' 'Nearly,' Harry said. 'Only a minute or two now.'

'It\'s quite painful.' Her words slipped out fast and soft, blurring into one another. 'Like, it really *really* hurts, but, at the same time, it doesn\'t. How weird is that?'

'That *is* quite strange.' Harry turned round and shoved his way into the hospital wing with his back. 'But Madam Pomfrey will fix it for you in a moment.'

Katie looked up from his shoulder. \'You aren\'t going to do something silly and go after Umbridge, are you?\'

\'Madam Pomfrey,\' Harry called.

She bustled out, pulling her wand from her pocket. 'You

better not have burnt yourself or something again, Mr Potter.' 'Not me, Katie,' Harry said. 'I'm completely fine.'

Madam Pomfrey's eyes dropped to Katie. 'Put her on a clean bed. I'll be with her in a second.' She stepped back inside her office

and began to rummage. Glass and metal clinked behind the frosted window.

Katie bumped her head against Harry's chest. \'Oi, Harry.

Promise me you won\'t get caught doing something stupid.\'

Harry smiled and set her down on the bed. \'I promise not to

get caught doing something stupid.'

*I won\'t get caught at all.*

She beamed, then squirmed onto her side and grabbed his

hand. 'Stay here, please. I don't really like hospitals.'

'I'll stay if you're quiet and stop moving around.' Harry gave her fingers a squeeze. 'I'm sure Angelina and Alicia will be here soon, too.'

# The Pen is Mightier

A thick quiet hovered over the classroom like fog, punctuated by the slow scratch of quills, the gentle tick of the clock, and Umbridge's erratic throat clearing.

Harry drew an extra line under the chapter title, and re- crossed and dotted his letters while Umbridge watched the clock. He pulled a small scrap of parchment out from under his work and double-checked Fleur's note on re-enchanting simple things.

*Confundus Charm to scramble any anti-tampering enchantments. Weave your intent into the magic on the object.*

'Okay, children.' Umbridge buttoned her cardigan. 'Pack away your things and leave quietly.'

*And we're done for the week.* Harry slipped out in the midst of the huddle of students, then stepped into a shadowed alcove.

*Which means it's time to get on with things.*

\'How\'s Katie?\' Nev popped up beside him.

\'Still in the hospital wing.\' Harry pulled out his invisibility cloak. \'If you hang around for a few minutes I was about to go and visit her.\'

Nev frowned at him. \'You\'re about to break your promise to her, aren\'t you?\'

\'I promised not to get caught,\' Harry said. \'And how do you even know about that?\'

\'Katie mentioned it to Angelina and Alicia in the hospital wing. I overheard them talking to the Weasley twins about it and

your little stunt with Malfoy.\' Nev shook his head. \'I don\'t know what you thought you were doing, that was *not* some school corridor jinx.\'

\'It was meant to be the water-conjuring charm.\' Harry shrugged. \'I was angry and it went a bit wrong.\'

\'I\'ll wait out here,\' Nev said. \'I doubt Umbridge is coming

back soon, but if she is, I'll try and delay her.\'

\'Thanks, Nev.\' Harry pulled the cloak over himself. \'I\'ll be

quick.\'

He re-entered the classroom, glanced about, and strode

down the rows of desks and into Umbridge\'s office. Pink curtains, cushions, and cat-themed china decorations covered the room.

*It\'s hideous. Like Marge, but with cats rather than slobbering*

*pitbulls.*

Harry picked his way over to her desk and rummaged

through the drawers. 'Where's the quill?'

He pried open a plain wooden box and found a silver- tipped, black-feathered quill as long as his hand. Harry touched the tip of his wand to it and tried to sense the intent.

A vague, crude impression of malice reached him. A sour, sharp excitement that brought the memory of Umbridge's gleaming eyes staring at the injured Katie.

He swallowed the bile that rose in his throat. *She made this herself to force children to repeatedly self-mutilate. And she enjoyed it.* Harry let the ice close around his heart. *Time for a little taste of her own malice.*

'Confundus,' he murmured.

The quill shivered.

Harry pushed his magic into the quill. *Now to tweak things.* He tried to thread his intent through the existing enchantment, but Umbridge's magic vanished before his like kitchen grease beneath a soapy sponge. He soaked it in his own intent instead, dyeing the magic with his will. *Malice repaid in kind.*

Harry permitted himself a small, thin smile and replaced

everything as he'd found it. 'Mischief managed.'

He strode out, stepped back into the alcove, and pulled the cloak off. Nev drifted back down the corridor.

'Hospital wing time,' Harry said.

\'What did you do?\' Nev asked.

\'Nothing much.\' Harry headed toward the infirmary. \'Just altered her detention plans a little.\'

\'The quill?\' Nev whispered. \'You know about it?\'

'Yes.' Nev's eyes blazed. 'Umbridge makes people write lines with it and it etches the words into your hand every time you write. Ron's got permanent *scars*.'

'It's not too far from making people hurt themselves to hurting people yourself,' Harry said. 'Be careful of her. She's obviously not very powerful, but she's probably got enough malice to cast some nasty spells. Like the Cruciatus Curse.'

Nev clenched his fists. 'Did you destroy it?'

\'I didn\'t destroy it,\' Harry said. \'I *improved* it.\'

\'I don\'t think I want to know,\' Nev said. \'Just make sure it doesn\'t end up with someone getting hurt who doesn\'t deserve it.\'

\'Umbridge's magic was easy to wipe away. She's not going to be able to undo what I've done. Now the only one who'll get hurt if it's used is her. And my magic's stronger than hers, so the next words she gives to someone may cut quite *deep*.\'

*I do hope the next words she chooses to make a student write are appropriately ironic.* Harry pushed open the door to the hospital wing.

Katie sat propped up on a pile of pillows with a copy of next year\'s charms textbook in front of her. A small mountain of chocolate boxes and cards rose from the table and chair beside her bed.

She grinned when she caught sight of them and tossed her book onto the table. \'Hi, Harry!\'

He took a seat on the edge of her bed. 'Hello, Katie.'

Nev hovered in the background. 'H-hi, Katie.'

Katie beamed. \'What did you bring me, Harry?\'

\'This is Neville.\' Harry patted Nev on the cheek. \'He\'s a who, not a what, Katie, and I\'m sure you two know each other.\'

She feigned a scowl. \'I meant for my get well present.' 'Does Nev not count?' he asked.

Nev snorted. \'He got you revenge.'

Katie glowered. \'You shouldn\'t have done that. Rita Skeeter devoted the entirety of her column to your attack on Malfoy.\'

\'Did she?\' Harry pulled the copy of the Daily Prophet out from under Katie\'s pile of chocolate boxes and well-wishing cards.

*Boy-Who-Lied attacks student in vicious, unprovoked assault. Wonderful.*

\'Look on the bright side,\' Katie said. \'Either *someone* sees this and murders you, in which case you don\'t need to worry about anything, or you\'ll still be able to run off.\'

\'Thanks, Katie. I\'ve missed you so much over the last few

days.\'

\'He has, actually,\' Nev piped up. 'He looked very bored.'

\'It\'s true,\' Harry said. \'The firsties are all but in revolt without

you to terrify them into submission. Black times are ahead without Gryffindor\'s Dark Mistress to keep order.\'

\'I\'m out of here by the end of the weekend,\' Katie announced. \'I\'ll soon have those little tykes back under the heel where they belong.\'

Nev shook his head. \'It\'s the way she says it so seriously and

genuinely. I'm never quite sure you\'re joking.\'

\'She isn\'t.\' Harry grinned. \'Katie's evil. She-Who-Must-Not- Be-Named.\'

\'Did you read the rest of the article?\' Katie tapped the copy of the paper he was still holding.

\'No. It\'s certainly all nonsense about me being a murderer and attacking students and the like.\' Harry stroked at an imaginary goatee. 'I wonder what they'd write if I *did* murder someone. I think most people are getting a bit bored now.'

\'Some of it makes no sense,\' Katie said. \'It says that Skeeter interviewed Malfoy yesterday, but he was still in here with me complaining to himself about his injuries and I never saw her at all.\'

\'Maybe she got the date wrong,\' Nev suggested. \'She got pretty much everything else wrong by the look of it.\'

\'Perhaps, but the quotes do sound a lot like what Malfoy was saying in here, so she must have spoken to him at some point.\' Katie tugged the paper back out of Harry\'s hands. 'This is mine. I'm going to frame it as proof I was once heroically defended by Harry Potter. Girls dream about that, you know.\'

\'It didn\'t sound all that heroic to me,\' Nev muttered. He wilted at Harry's raised eyebrow. \'Sorry, Harry, but you did kind of curse him in front of a teacher for doing nothing more than opening his mouth like he always does.\'

\'I was angry.' Harry raised his hands. \'I probably should've

made sure there were no witnesses, though.\'

\'And now you\'re banned from quidditch for life,\' Katie said. \'It\'s a good thing Ginny Weasley wanted to be seeker or we wouldn\'t even have one in time for the first training sessions.\'

\'I\'ll try to keep my temper in the future,\' Harry said.

\'You better,\' Katie murmured. \'You promised me, remember?\'

\'I won\'t break my promise.'

\'What did you *do* to Malfoy?\' Katie asked. \'I didn\'t really see, but Pomfrey had to grow back a lot of his shoulder and arm, keep him under warming charms, and he was on blood replenishing potions for most of the next day.\'

\'A dark adaptation of the water conjuring spell according to some,\' Nev replied. \'I heard there was ice involved, but I also heard that you transformed into a giant serpent and bit him, so really nobody knows and those who saw aren\'t saying. Malfoy\'s been quite quiet recently.\'

\'That rumour must've come from Hufflepuff,\' Harry said. \'It has Ernie Macmillan all over it. He\'s still scared from second year.\'

\'I did overhear it from Cedric Diggory,\' Nev said. \'He was laughing at how ludicrous it was in the library until he and Cho were kicked out by Madam Pince for kissing too loudly.\'

*At least there are some people still on my side.*

\'So what have you been up to while I\'ve been stuck here?\' Katie tucked the Daily Prophet back under her collection of half- empty chocolate boxes.

Harry stole a chocolate from one. \'Lessons as normal.

Nothing exciting.\'

Nev coughed.

\'I might have tampered with an item of stationary in Umbridge\'s office,\' Harry added, eating his stolen chocolate.

*Hmmm. Mint. Not my favourite.*

Katie gasped. \'The quill?\'

\'How does everyone know about this?\' Harry demanded. \'It took me ages to figure out what she was doing.\'

\'A lot of Gryffindors have got detention from her.\' Katie shrugged. \'Word gets around.\'

device!\'

\'Then why hasn\'t anyone done anything? It\'s a torture

Katie squirmed. \'I think they\'re scared of what Umbridge will

do to them.\'

*If they\'re that scared of Umbridge, then Voldemort might as well just announce he\'s back and we\'ll lose instantly.*

\'What did you do to it?\' Katie whispered, glancing at Madam

Pomfrey's office.

\'I improved it,\' Harry replied. Katie fixed him with a glare.

\'I may have altered the enchantment,\' he said. 'Umbridge will probably regret making it the next time someone writes anything with it.'

Katie grinned. \'Good. I hope it leaves a permanent scar on her.' She leant forward, patted her pillows into shape, and punched Harry in the shoulder. \'That\'s for breaking your promise.\'

\'I didn\'t break it.\' Harry rubbed the sore spot. \'I promised I wouldn\'t get caught.\'

\'Oh.\' Katie chewed her lip. \'I did say that, didn\'t I?\'

\'Yes.\' Harry smirked. \'Just after offering me a chance to have a look at your *injuries.*\'

Katie turned crimson. \'Let\'s just pretend I never said that. I can\'t believe I thought that would be funny.\'

\'Do you have to talk about this when I\'m right here?\' Nev's

face glowed a brighter red than Katie's.

\'Sorry, Nev.\' Harry shot him a wink. \'Watch out for Katie, though. She\'s very forward.\'

Katie dragged the blankets back up above her head. \'Go away,\' she muttered. 'Go away and let me die of shame under here where I can\'t be seen.\'

\'Nope,\' Harry said. 'Not happening.'

Katie stuck her head back out. 'Don't you have things to do?'

\'I promised I\'d help Hermione, Dean, Seamus, and Ron again,\' Nev said.

Harry chuckled. 'I'm completely free, so I'll probably disappear for the weekend.'

Katie's eyes flicked up to his, then she turned away and picked another chocolate. \'So, Neville. What are you *helping* Hermione Granger with?\'

Nev turned crimson and squeaked. Katie dissolved into

giggles.

'I think Hermione's been experiencing some unusual feelings

recently,' Harry said. 'Nev kindly offered to help her out.'

\'Nothing like *that*.\' Nev shook his head. \'Just some of the

spells we're going to need but not learn in class.\'

\'It\'s turning into a bit of a regular thing now,\' Harry said. \'It\'ll be good for you to teach, you\'ll know if you can understand and do it if you can teach it.\'

\'H-hermione said that they\'re not the only ones who want help, either.\' Nev stared at his feet. \'Apparently everyone\'s s- struggling without someone to teach them.\'

\'I\'m sure you\'ll figure something out, Nev,\' Harry said.

\'He\'s upset he might have even more people there when all he really wants to do is give Hermione one-on-one lessons,\' Katie quipped.

Neville squirmed. \'She *is* evil. I don\'t even think of Hermione like that. It\'s just weird.\'

'What about me, Neville?' Katie fluttered her eyelashes at him. 'Do you think about *me* like that?'

Nev shot a glance at Harry. 'No.'

'Probably for the best,' Harry said. 'She'd be a terrifying girlfriend. Just ask the firsties. I\'ve never heard the words *human sacrifice* so many times in one explanation of how to get into Gryffindor Tower and I only caught the last part of her explanation.\'

Madman Pomfrey bustled out of her office. 'You two, *out.* Stop

disturbing everyone.'

Nev scuttled for the door. Harry lingered.

Katie sighed. \'I\'ll be out of here in a few days, Harry.' She flashed him a faint smile. 'I should be able come to your funeral once Frenchie's murdered you.\'

'I wouldn't bother,' Harry said. \'Once I\'m dead, she\'s coming

straight for you, so I\'ll be seeing you soon anyway.\'

\'She won\'t actually be angry with me, will she?\' Katie whispered.

\'Maybe a little bit,\' Harry said. \'I doubt it\'s that personal, you\'re just part of the reason I got myself in trouble.\'

*Although she does have a temper. I'm fairly sure Gabby got harshly scolded for throwing her magic at me and I didn't date Gabby before Fleur.*

'Sorry,' Katie murmured. 'If -- if us being friends is an issue---'

Harry poked her on the forehead. 'It's not. Fleur just won't like me doing something for you. Don't fret about it.'

'No girl likes it when their boyfriend is still friendly with his ex,'

Katie muttered.

Harry rolled his eyes. 'We had *one* date.' Katie pouted. 'We had fun.'

'Yeah, until the end.'

Her face fell. 'Until the end.'

\'Out you go, Mr Potter,' Madam Pomfrey ordered. \'And don\'t let me catch you sneaking back in later. Miss Bell needs to rest and relax or her ribs will take longer to recover.'

'Bye Katie.' Harry mussed her hair. 'I'll be waiting for you in

hell.'

'And you'll probably be burning before you get there.' A small

smile made it onto Katie's lips. 'See you soon.'

# From Paris with Love

Sunlight poured in through browning willow leaves. The breeze plucked a few, scattering them across the river surface. They drifted downstream, bumped by the sleek noses of curious fish, then washed ashore on the white pebbles at the river bend.

Fleur draped herself along the length of their branch and spun the acorn pendant of her necklace round her finger on its chain. *Merde.* She ripped this morning's copy of the Daily Prophet out from under her arm.

A younger Harry stared back at her.

Fleur studied the hollow glint in his eyes, tracing a fingertip down his cheek, and dragged her gaze across to the title. 'Boy-who- lied attempts to curse fellow pupil over quidditch accident.'

*Vraiment? Harry wouldn't curse someone over something*

*like that.*

She skimmed the text. 'Sixth year student Katie Bell...' Heat

bubbled in her bones and feathers thrust through her skin, her face shifted and heat curled up from her palms. '*Katie Bell.*'

Fleur took a deep breath. *There'll be a good explanation.*

She glanced at the paper, flicking through the pages to the next article. Katie Bell's messy brown hair, mahogany eyes, and bright grin beamed off the page at her. 'Merde. *Merde*. Pourquoi s'est-il mis en colère pour pétasse? Il l'aimetoujours?'

Fleur's face flooded with liquid heat and a curved beak

thrust from her nose and chin. The paper burst into flames. She

watched the ashes float down from the branch, drifting away into the river on the breeze.

*Harry's coming soon.* She smothered the heat back down until her face shifted back and the feathers of her arms slipped back beneath her skin. *He better have a really good explanation for getting so angry over that girl.*

Fleur stifled another rush of heat before she changed again. 'And if you don't, monCœur. I will kill you and then we will have a *very* long talk.'

*A very very long talk.* She lay back on the branch, closed her eyes, and let the sound of the willow leaves rustling in the breeze drown out her thoughts.

A soft snap echoed under the leaves.

Fleur snapped her eyes open and leapt down onto the pebbles, heat trickling through her bones. 'Bonjour, monCœur.' Small white feather tips slid out from under her skin as she stepped close to him. 'Quevoulais-tu?'

Harry winced. 'You're angry,' he murmured.

Fleur glimpsed herself in his eyes, her irises gleaming black as night. \'Of course I\'m angry.' She smothered the heat of her change as her chin shifted..

\'I sort of knew you would be,\' he whispered. \'I hoped you\'d understand.\'

\'Understand?\' Fleur threw her hands up in the air. \'You impaled this Malfoy with four inch spikes of ice. Et pourquoi? *Katie Bell!*\'

Harry shook his head. 'I would've done it if it'd been any of my friends, Fleur. I promise.'

'You promise.' The heat spilt into her eyes and Fleur's lip trembled. 'How do I know? I am here. You and her are over there *together.*'

Harry grimaced. 'Fleur...'

'Non.' She pressed her finger to her lips. 'If it were me who

got hurt, what would you have done, Harry? Don't lie.'

He studied the sky and green light flickered beneath his right sleeve. 'I didn't actually mean to hurt him, you know, just shut him up and get him out of the way. I was angry and that messed with my water-conjuring spell.' Harry's eyes met hers, cold and hard as agate. 'If it'd been you, I would've killed him. And I would've meant to.' A gleam of worry hovered in his eyes. 'I know that might not be what you want to hear, but I'm not some jack-in-the-box hero who comes out to save the day, then gets packed away until next time.'

Fleur's heart squirmed. 'And I'm not just a pretty face, monCœur. I face my own dragons.'

Harry's lips twisted. 'So? You're not angry?'

'Not anymore.' Fleur grabbed him by his robes. 'But if you give me a reason to think you're running around with Katie Bell behind my back...' She traced her fingertips along his jaw, smiling when he shivered. 'I do *not* like how fiercely you defended that girl. You're *mine.*'

\'Katie's just a friend,\' Harry said. 'I---'

'I\'m not going to abandon you, monCœur. Not now, not

ever.\'

\'Not even if I told you what I\'ve done?\'

Unease tangled itself in Fleur's abdomen. \'As long as you\'re

*my* Harry, I won\'t care.'

He pulled her close and pressed his lips to her forehead. \'Definitely yours, ma Princesse.\'

'Vraiment?' Fleur's voice shook. She huffed at his small smile and stamped on his toes. 'Vraiment?'

'Vraiment,' he echoed. 'I got myself trapped in other people's unfair and selfish expectations not so long ago. Now, I'm free of that. There are millions of individuals trying to get what they want and I\'m just one of them.\' He slipped a finger under her chin and tilted her face up toward his. 'And *you're* what I want.'

Her heart fluttered. 'And what would you do to get that,

monCœur?'

The corner of Harry's lips twitched. \'Anything I had to do.' He rested his forehead on hers. 'You're the one perfect wish that came true. Nothing else is worth a fraction of you.'

*Perfect. As always.* Warmth flooded through Fleur's chest.

\'Then you\'ll be more careful next time you want to curse someone, won\'t you? You can't come visit me if they lock you up in Azkaban, Harry.\'

He pressed his lips to hers, slipping a hand up to the back of her neck. \'I was afraid that you wouldn\'t understand,\' he murmured.

\'Do you think I'm so different?\' She cupped his face between her palms. 'Gabby is the one who believes in things like this. I gave

up a long time ago. Until you.' Fleur pouted. 'And now look at me,

planning the rest of my life with some English boy.'

\'Isn\'t it a little early to say things like that?\' A teasing glint hovered in his eyes. \'We\'ve only been together for a few months.\'

\'Are we going too fast for you, Harry?\' She leant in close, brushing the tip of her nose against his. \'I suppose I should stop---'

Harry caught her lips with his, pressing her back into the warm willow's trunk. His hands tangled in her hair, drifting to her hips and cupping her waist. Her breasts crushed against his chest and a soft, sweet fire seared through her veins.

He pulled back. 'Still want to stop?' A soft moan escaped Fleur's lips. She flushed. 'Non.'

He laughed, but heat smouldered in his green eyes. 'That

was a *very* sexy moan. Are you sure this spot's too uncomfortable?'

She dragged his mouth back down onto hers for a soft kiss and let the fire fade from her blood. \'Yes.\' Fleur rested her arms over his shoulders. \'Now, I want to see what you can do. The Daily Prophet spent so much time talking about this dark curse you used that I want to see it for myself.\'

Harry smirked. \'I have a better idea. You know how to duel, don\'t you?\'

Fleur sniffed. 'Of course. I am the champion.'

He laughed. \'Of course you are. Want to try me?'

\'You will lose. I am a good duellist.\'

\'I need practice.' Harry wagged his finger at her. \'But you should know better than to tell me you\'ll beat me. You said you\'d win the Triwizard Tournament, too.\'

\'I would've done if Voldemort\'s follower hadn\'t interfered.' She grabbed his arm and apparated them back to the chateau. 'You will see.'

They arrived amongst Gabby\'s shoes. \'Are your parents home?\' Harry asked.

\'Not today, not until late. There's an event in Paris they're attending together.\' She took his hand and led him around the main staircase to the smaller second set of steps and down towards the basement.

\'Do you have a dungeon?\' Harry grinned. \'Please tell me you

do.\'

\'No, but we have a basement that is partly a wine-cellar and

partly empty. Maman used to brew potions down there, but when they enlarged the shop in Carcassonne she no longer needed to. Gabby and I use it occasionally, normally for practising magic since it\'s well warded.\'

\'What're the rules?\'

\'Normal duelling rules,\' Fleur said. Harry raised an eyebrow.

*He doesn't know the rules?*

\'Nothing more dangerous than a stunner, no stepping out of the ring, and no speaking except for spell incantations. But I want to see the curse you used on Malfoy first.\'

She tugged him down the steps and out under the high, vaulted cellar ceiling where racks of wine bottles lined the walls.. An earthy, musty filled Fleur's nose.

'What about the wine?' Harry asked.

'We are going in there.' Fleur pointed at the small door at

the far end.

*Otherwise very expensive vintages of wine get ruined and Papa gets angry.* Fleur swung the door shut. *Very angry.*

\'Show me,' she demanded. 'You wouldn't show me the fire one, so you have to show me this one.'

Harry drew himself up, adopted a serious, focused expression and slid his wand from his sleeve.

Fleur laughed. 'I hope that is not your duelling face,

monCœur.'

Harry shot her a grin, twirling his wand like a conductor's

stick. \'Aguamenti!\'

A small stream of water burst from the tip of his wand and spattered on the floor.

Fleur pulled her wand. 'Show me or I'll curse you.'

\'That\'s the spell I used. I promise.\'

She pouted. \'Then stop being difficult and show me what you did to it.\'

\'What will you do if I don\'t?\' Harry teased.

\'I\'ll tell Gabby about the photos in the Room of Requirement,\' Fleur promised. 'She will pester you about it every time you see her until the end of time.'

Harry paled a fraction. \'That seems a little harsh.' He closed his eyes for a moment and ice crept back into his expression. \'Aguamenti,\' he hissed.

Water sprayed across the room against the wall, sharp chunks of ice smashed against the sandstone and shattered like glass.

Fleur stared at the shards of ice upon the floor. \'How did you do that? That\'s a simple conjuring spell, not a curse.\'

\'I told you. I was angry.\'

She walked over to the pile of jagged fragments and poked it with her toe. Thick, sharp-edged pieces the width and length of her palm covered the cellar floor. \'I\'ve never seen anything quite like it.'

\'You haven\'t?\' A frown creased his brow.

\'It\'s brilliant. Dangerous, but brilliant.\' She poked the pieces of ice with her toe. \'I don't know why your emotions have so much more influence over your magic, but I\'m not duelling you seriously until you can control that. It's not safe.'

Harry\'s wand disappeared into his sleeve. 'Then we'd best not duel.'

\'When does it happen?\' Fleur murmured.

\'When I\'m angry,\' Harry said. \'I don\'t know why it happens. It doesn't happen much. Just a couple of times.\' He folded his arms. 'We're not duelling until I'm sure it won't happen.'

*He's as bad as Papa.*

'Let\'s go somewhere,\' Fleur said. \'Somewhere nice.\' \'Where?\'

\'I know a place in Paris,\' Fleur said \'But we need to go kidnap Gabby first.\'

\'We do?\' A smile crept back onto Harry's face.

*Oh, smile because Gabby's going to come and help you tease me.* A slight pout curved Fleur's lips. *A good thing I met you when I did, or Gabby might've really stolen you first.*

\'I promised her that we\'d go there with her,' she said. 'It\'s our favourite place and she\'s been lonely at Beauxbatons with me always coming to see you. I made her promise to be good, or as good as she can be, at least.\'

Harry chuckled. \'How are we going to kidnap her?'

Fleur pulled the portkey she'd made for herself out of her robes and waved it at him. 'Madame Maxime lets me do what I want, within reason. She might chide me for stealing my little sister away, but only because I forgot to ask first.'

\'Doesn\'t Beauxbatons have anti-portkey wards?\' Harry

asked.

\'Of course it does.\' Fleur smirked. \'Only someone keyed into

the wards can create a portkey to the school.\' Harry raised an eyebrow and nodded.

Fleur huffed. \'Aren\'t you going to ask me how I did it?\'

A broad grin stretched across Harry's face. \'How did you achieve this most brilliant and noteworthy accomplishment, ma princess?\'

\'I created my own ward key from scratch.' Fleur turned her nose up. 'It's the sort of thing that gets you into a lot of trouble if you get caught, but then gets you a very well-paid job in a very particular part of the government.'

Harry pulled his necklace out of his robes. \'A shame this one's wasted on me, then. I portkey to and from outside them anyway.\'

'Fortunately my enchantment *hasn't* been wasted on you. I can't create a key for Hogwarts wards without spending a lot of time there figuring them out.\' Fleur extended her arm. 'Let's go.'

Harry linked his arm with hers.

'Argent,' Fleur murmured.

They stepped into her room.

Harry smiled and pointed at the photo on her bedside table. \'I remember that picture.\'

Gabby waved at Harry, who waved back with a grin. Fleur's

own image stared at Harry with a wrinkled brow.

\'Where\'s your sister?\' Harry's half-smile lit up her room like the sun. \'Do we have to sneak through Beauxbatons?\'

\'Well, if we were anyone else we could just walk and nobody would think twice, but since you\'re famous and I am who I am, it\'d be best to disillusion ourselves.\'

Harry chuckled. \'Will she scream if we grab her while we\'re invisible?\'

\'Not anymore. She\'s used to it. If she knows I\'m coming, she\'ll feel for my magic and grab me instead.\'

\'Does she know we\'re coming?\' \'Not this time. Follow me.\'

She led Harry out of her room, taking his hand and pausing only to disillusion themselves, then down the corridor in the direction of Gabby's favourite spot.

\'I prefer Hogwarts,\' Harry whispered. \'Beauxbatons is beautiful, but it doesn\'t quite seem as magical.\'

\'You are a biased, tasteless English boy, though. Beauxbatons is far more elegant and just as magical,\' Fleur murmured. \'Hogwarts is grey, draughty, and has that horrible forest.\'

Harry squeezed her hand with a quiet laugh. \'You haven\'t seen half of the horrors of that forest.\'

The burnt skeleton amidst the pine trunks and needles

hovered before Fleur's mind's eye. *I've seen enough.*

She pointed their joined hands at the door toward the far end of the corridor. 'Gabby\'s out there. The door leads out over the buttress to a small balcony, nobody else ever goes there.\'

Fleur eased the handle open and pushed the door. It let out a loud creak.

Gabby's head snapped round in a swirl of silver hair and she closed her eyes. 'Fleur! And you brought Harry.' Gabby peered around. \'I can only see where Fleur is.\'

'Hello, little chick.' Fleur let her magic fade and swept

Gabby into a hug.

Harry faded back into sight and shot Fleur's sister a smile.

\'Gabby.'

Gabby pouted. \'You were right next to Fleur. How couldn't I

see you?\'

\'My Disillusionment Charm's better than hers is.' He shot her a triumphant grin, sending her heart flip-flopping about in her chest.

'Our magic battles with the intent of the charm,' Fleur said. 'Our allure requires us to be seen to work best, so it draws attention to us.'

again?\'

\'Why are you here?\' Gabby chirped. \'Am I being kidnapped

\'This is a regular thing?\' Harry asked.

\'Beauxbatons is boring.\' Gabby bounced on her feet. \'I

always get Fleur to come and rescue me and take me somewhere more fun. Normally we go to Carcassonne or Paris.\'

\'Paris.\' Fleur mussed Gabby's hair. \'We\'re going to your

favourite place in all of France.\'

Her eyes lit up and she seized Fleur's hand in one of hers and Harry's in the other. Let\'s go! I\'ve been craving meringues *all day*.\'

Fleur retrieved Harry from her Gabby's grip, linking arms with him. \'Do you remember your promise?\' she murmured in her sister's ear.

Gabby sulked. \'Of course I do. No trying to charm Fleur\'s boyfriend, she gets overly tetchy about it.\' Mischief gleamed in her blue eyes. \'You never made me promise not to tell him about you.\'

\'I made you promise to be good,\' Fleur reminded her. \'If one word of the things I said about Harry comes out of you, I\'m going to burn every pair of shoes you own.\'

\'Are we going?\' Harry asked.

\'We\'re going.\' Fleur side-long apparated them onto the cobbles of Paris opposite a quaint little restaurant.

\'Welcome to Madam Antoinette\'s.\' Gabby grinned. \'It's got

the best desserts in all of Paris and most of France. We\'ve checked.\'

A small, stout man wearing a chocolate-stained chef\'s coat glanced up at them as they entered, a hint of glaze creeping into his eyes. 'Mademoiselles Delacour. Bienvenue. Your usual table is free.'

Gabby beamed and darted to a table at the back.

\'I thought this was *Madam* Antoinette\'s?\' Harry took a seat opposite Gabby and accepted the menu she thrust at him.

\'It\'s a very bad joke,\' Fleur said. \'The owner is muggle-born and doesn\'t realise that most wizards won\'t understand, of course he does make wonderful food, so we have forgiven him.\'

Gabby huffed. \'They\'re out of meringues. I shall have to have Clafoutis instead.\'

Fleur rolled her eyes. 'How terrible for you, Gabby. Stuck

eating your favourite dessert.\'

\'I wanted meringues today, they\'re sweeter than cherries.\'

Harry raised an eyebrow.

Fleur smiled. 'It\'s not a veela thing, just a Delacour one.\' She turned a pointed look on her baby sister. \'Gabby is the worst of all of us.\'

\'I am not,\' she said. \'Everyone knows Fleur is the worst. She once ate a whole box of icing sugar in the middle of the night.\'

\'I remember having a significant amount of help eating that,\' Fleur murmured.

Gabby flushed. \'You have honey for breakfast.\' \'Lots of people eat honey for breakfast.'

\'Fleur eats it out of the jar,\' Gabby crowed. \'With a tablespoon.\'

\'That is unusual.\' Harry grinned. \'I think Gabby might be

right.\'

Fleur shrugged. 'You should be grateful for my love of

sweet things, Harry. If I did not love dessert wine so much, our

evening at the Yule Ball might've ended very differently.\' Harry flushed. 'True,' he muttered.

Gabby squeaked and turned crimson behind her menu. \'Fleur? You *didn\'t?!*\'

\'Didn\'t what?\'

Gabby shifted in her seat and glanced at Harry. \'You know...\' Her eyes flashed with mischief, and the flush rose further up her face.

\'No!\' Harry's face flared bright red. \'She kissed me under the

mistletoe, then she ran away.\'

\'I did *not* run away.\'

Gabby giggled. 'Did she try and avoid you and pretend

nothing was happening?'

Harry grinned. 'Definitely. Has she done that before?'

'Not with a boy.' Gabby leant across the table, snatching her feet back just in time to avoid Fleur's stomp. 'But whenever she was in trouble when we were younger, she'd always run off and then pretend she'd done nothing wrong.'

'Better than giving Maman the big eyes and blaming me, little chick.' Fleur shot Gabby a half-hearted glare. 'I got blamed for *everything* by this tiny harpy. Don't trust her, Harry. She's a sneaky, greedy little bird.'

Gabby tried to pout but dissolved into giggles. 'Fleur's only being mean because I told her if she didn't want you, I'd have you. I think she's worried I was being serious.'

Harry laughed and winked at her. 'Well, if you change your

mind and decide you are serious, Gabby. You just let me know.'

Fleur huffed and crossed her arms. 'We both know I am perfect for you, Harry. You'd never leave me for another girl.' She gave him a sweet smile. 'And if you did, *especially* for my little sister, I would burn you to ashes.'

Gabby sighed. 'Just like in Maman's books.'

The chef strode over, a small book in his hand.

'Mademoiselles? Monsieur?'

'Clafoutis,' Fleur said. 'Trois, s'ilvousplaît.' She shared a smile with Gabby. 'We need to teach you some good taste, Harry. I've eaten English food and all the good bits were stolen from other countries. Clafoutis is a good place to start.'

'If Gabby will share it, that is,' Harry quipped.

'Gabby doesn't share cherries,' Gabby said. 'But Fleur made

me promise to be good, so this one time I'll make an exception.'

# Dumbledore's Army

Stained tables and battered chairs spread beneath a dirt- smudged, cobweb-strewn ceiling and a lopsided, stuffed boar\'s head hung above the fire. Harry studied the dust and spiders clustered above their heads, balancing a coaster over the top of his drink.

'Good idea.' Katie mimicked him and waved a hand at Hermione, Ron, Dean and Nev. 'Which is more than can be said for their club plans.'

Harry sipped his butterbeer and replaced the coaster. 'Why

are *we* here again?'

\'I wanted to get out of Hogwarts and go walking around Hogsmeade for a bit.\' Katie took a long drink. Foam lingered on her upper lip.

\'I mean *right* here, as in the Hog\'s Head.' Harry waved a hand at their grime-coated surroundings. 'We already went walking up to the Shrieking Shack earlier.\'

\'Oh.\' Katie licked the foam of her upper lip and batted her eyelashes. \'Don\'t you know?\'

\'Obviously if I knew, I wouldn\'t be asking.'

\'Don\'t be grumpy.\' She patted him on the cheek with her cold, damp hand.

Harry wiped the condensation of his cheek and gave her a flat look. *'And?'*

'Hermione, Ron, and Dean have been offering to form a group for Neville to teach.'

\'But you've already done your OWLs and I'm the one who taught Neville\...'

\'I thought it might be fun, so did a few other older students.' She beamed. 'And I really don't have anything fun to do today but drag you around Hogsmeade like a reluctant boyfriend.'

\'It\'s going to be quite a small group.\' Harry glanced round at the empty tables. \'I\'m teaching him, they\'re already learning from him, and you\'re only here to have a laugh and hex me.\'

\'Everyone\'s supposed to come in about five minutes.'

\'Ah, so it won\'t just be us.\'

\'No, though I have no idea how many people will actually be coming.\' She scrunched up her face. \'Maybe ten or fifteen.\'

\'They might be disappointed.\' Harry finished his drink and nodded at the quartet. \'Neville might not ever agree to teach them. He doesn't seem impressed Hermione set all this up without asking him first. \'

\'Can't say I blame him. Hermione can be a bit rude sometimes.' Katie eyed the back of Hermione\'s head and turned to Harry with a grin. 'You\'ll have to teach us instead.'

Harry laughed. \'Dark ice curses for beginners.\'

She punched him on the shoulder. 'Don\'t joke. Impaling other students with icicles isn\'t funny.\'

'Not even when I did it for you, dearest dark mistress?' Harry leant to her ear. 'You didn't object to me defending you.' He snorted. 'Actually, if I remember rightly, you offered to let me check out your--- \'

\'Harry.\' Hermione\'s voice cut through his whisper. \'Tell Neville he has to teach us.\'

\'Why?\' He grinned at Katie's as she hid her pink face behind her drink. \'He can make his own decisions, Hermione. He's his own person. If you want to, or think you should, then by all means teach, Nev, but don\'t let them force you into something.\'

\'Umbridge isn\'t going to teach us,\' Ron said.

\'Yeah and Neville helped us already with his shield charm,\' Dean said. \'I\'m sure he wouldn\'t mind helping you, or anyone else, if he\'d only get over his fear of speaking to people he doesn\'t really know.\'

\'I know I should teach,\' Neville muttered. \'But nobody'd

listen to me, they\'ll never think that I know what I\'m talking about.\'

\'Show them they\'re wrong,\' Harry said. \'When they see you\'re better than them they\'ll have to swallow their pride and ask for help. It will be fun. If they're anything like Hermione, it may literally cause them physical pain.\'

Hermione shot him a glare. Katie drowned a giggle in her butterbeer next to him, spattering foam over her mouth.

\'Very attractive,\' Harry said.

Katie flushed. 'Hush you.'

\'Everyone will be here soon.\' Hermione chewed at her lip. 'I already promised them it would happen if they wanted.'

Harry rolled his eyes. \'You should've thought about that

before leaving it to the last minute to ask Nev.'

\'I *assumed* he\'d want to help his friends,\' Hermione said.

\'Maybe *he* already is helping all his friends,\' he replied.

Neville glanced between them. \'I\'ll teach, but Harry will be my assistant.\'

*Not very often I won't be. I've got things to do.*

Ron and Dean winced. Hermione\'s face brightened. \'That\'s good.\' Katie pointed through the window. \'Because

everyone\'s arriving now.\'

Neville gulped, then straightened up and fixed a determined expression on his face. Small clusters of people flooded in until there were no empty chairs and no standing space round the dirt-stained walls.

\'There're a few more than ten,\' Harry remarked.

Katie giggled. \'Clearly I underestimated Neville\'s appeal.'

\'That or nobody has managed to teach themselves how to do a Shield Charm.\'

She sighed. 'A shame you'll be too busy scrubbing cauldrons with Snape for icing Malfoy to teach us all. I've always had a little fantasy about being kept behind by the handsome professor.' Katie offered Harry a coy smile. 'I\'ll do *anything* to make my grade up, professor.'

He laughed. 'I don't think getting yourself immolated by an angry veela is going to help your grades, Miss Bell.'

Katie pouted. 'Why did Dumbledore even give you the

detentions?'

*So he can get Snape to keep an eye on me, probably.* Harry shrugged at her.

\'I guess we should start, then.\' Hermione stepped in front of the fire and raised her voice. \'*Professor* Umbridge doesn\'t want to teach us any real magic, so we\'ll have to learn it and practice ourselves. Neville has already helped us from time to time and he\'s agreed, with a few *stipulations*, to help teach a larger group.\'

\'Longbottom?\' Zacharias Smith ran a hand through his blond hair and laughed. \'He doesn\'t even know which end of the wand to hold.\'

Neville flinched.

Hermione huffed. 'I---'

\'Let\'s see your shield charm, Smith,\' Nev ordered. 'Come on.'

Smith flushed and sat down. \'Protego,\' Neville said.

A bright wall of silver light hovered around Nev. Murmurs rippled through the pub.

Harry studied the tremble shivering through it every few seconds with a critical eye. *A loss of focus? He's got the power and intent down fine.*

\'So now it\'s obvious that Neville can help, we want to know if you\'re interested in being part of the group,\' Hermione said.

\'How will it be run?\' One of the other Hufflepuffs asked. \'And what were Neville\'s stipulations?\' A Ravenclaw asked.

\'I had three,\' Neville said. \'They aren't negotiable, if you want to be helped, you'll have to accept them. Firstly, *nobody* tells Umbridge *anything*, none of us want to spend any time in her office doing *lines.* Secondly, the locations and dates of meetings will be conveyed secretly and are to be kept a secret, along with the group\'s name and the names of the other members. Lastly, Harry Potter will be assisting me.\'

\'I\'m not letting him use dark magic on me,\' Smith shouted. \'I read about what he did to Malfoy.\'

\'Malfoy pretty much deserved it,\' Ron snapped. \'I was there and so were Angelina, Ginny, Katie, and my brothers. He thought it was funny to gloat over having deliberately hurt Katie and get in the way of getting her to the hospital wing.\'

\'Look on the bright side,\' Katie piped up. \'You\'ll get very good at defending against the Dark Arts if Harry\'s helping.\'

\'Thanks, Katie.\' Harry let the sarcasm pour off his tongue.

'You\'re welcome.' She offered him an innocent stare look as

she finished her drink.

\'What\'s wrong with just learning from Neville?\' Terry Boot demanded.

\'Harry's the one who taught Neville,\' Hermione replied. \'You\'re learning from him indirectly anyway.\'

\'Fine.\' Smith sneered. \'But don\'t expect us to like it. I don\'t trust him.\'

\'It'll give you a good motive to work on your shield charm,

Smith,\' Neville snapped.

\'So how're we doing this?\' Terry Boot asked.

\'Everyone who wants to join signs their name on this list.\' Hermione waved an inauspicious piece of parchment in the air. \'Anyone else might as well leave now.\'

Cho and a couple of students from Ravenclaw shrugged and slipped out. Everyone else clumped round the table by the fire and added their names.

Harry paused over the list. The blue flames of the goblet of fire flickered through his thoughts. *Best to check I'm not signing up to anything inconvenient.* He ran his forefinger down the list of names and checked for enchantments with his wand in his sleeve.

A soft, righteous anger saturated the magic the parchment was steeped in.

*Hermione's not showing any mercy to anyone who talks, but compared to Fleur\'s work, this is crayon art. It only punishes direct betrayals.*

'Done.' Harry signed his name with a flourish and re-joined Katie in the middle of the group.

\'So how do we know when to meet and where?\' Someone

asked.

\'That\'s easy.\' Hermione glowed. \'You all get one of these.\'

She held out a box of familiar badges.

Neville paled.

*S.P.E.W. Again.* Harry grimaced. *Really not the best acronym, Hermione.*

\'Since I'd nothing to do with them, I\'ve enchanted them with the Protean Charm. When Neville changes the numbers on the back of all the badges it will change on all the others. The number will give you the time and date of the next meeting.\'

\'Do we have to, like, wear them?\' Lavender muttered. Ron sniggered.

\'No.\' Hermione sighed. \'But do try to be more careful about losing them this year than you were last year.\'

\'That\'s very clever,\' Boot said. \'But it doesn\'t tell us where to

meet.\'

*Hermione's done pretty well. The Protean Charm's a NEWT*

*level spell and actually quite versatile*. *Maybe I\'ll learn it, it might be useful.*

Nev nodded. \'All our meetings will be held in the same place, you\'ll know where to come from the second time, but for the first you should meet next to Hogwarts\' worst tapestry on the seventh floor.\'

'We need a name for the group,\' the nearest Weasley twin

suggested.

\'Ronniekins Rangers.\' The other twin grinned. \'Or Hermione\'s Heroes.\'

\'How about something vaguely appropriate?\' Angelina interrupted. \'And something that *doesn\'t* encourage your obsession with alliteration.\'

\'The Defence Club,\' Smith said.

\'Well it\'s a bit boring, isn\'t it,\' one of the twins muttered.

\'Obvious, too,\' the other said. 'If someone gets overheard, Umbridge\'ll be straight onto us.'

*Which could be all she needs to oust Dumbledore and stop him watching over me all the time.* Harry\'s mind raced. *As long as he was strongly implicated in the group somehow. Umbridge needs to go, too.* He smiled up at the ceiling as it all coalesced together for him. *And wouldn\'t it be perfect to get rid of them both using the same piece of parchment?*

\'They should call it Dumbledore\'s Army.' Harry made sure his joke carried further than just Katie. 'That\'s what the Ministry seems to think we\'re being turned into.\'

Katie laughed and raised her hand. 'All in favour?'

Hermione smiled and stuck her hand in the air. \'Anyone

else?\'

Harry stuck his hand up in the midst of the crowd. *Part way*

*there. Just need a good way to let Umbridge know and some way of getting rid of her afterward.*

\'Dumbledore\'s Army it is.\' Hermione wrote the name in elegant, neat letters across the top of the list.

\'You should tell them about the list, Hermione,\' Ron said. \'Just in case.\'

She frowned. \'Yes. Right. I\'ve placed a few enchantments on the paper, they took me quite some time to look up and create. When you signed your names, you entered into a kind of magical contract with the group. If you knowingly betray the rules you agreed to by staying, there'll be unpleasant consequences.\'

Smith scowled. \'What kind of consequences?\'

\'Let\'s just say everyone will know who it was who betrayed

us,\' Nev replied. 'You don't want to be that person.'

The box of badges began its rounds.

\'I thought I\'d escaped these last year.\' Harry chose one for himself and passed another to Katie.

\'It suits you,\' she replied. \'The green brings out your eyes.\' \'Thank you, Katie.\' Harry grinned at her. \'I shall wear it

always.\'

\'So what\'re we going to be learning?\' Terry Boot asked.

\'Nobody actually specified.\'

\'I can help you learn everything that you\'ll find on the OWL exam.\' Nev shot Harry a glance. \'For those who want to be able to do a bit more, then Harry has taught me some very useful spells and knows a lot more.\'

\'Like what?\' Smith balled his fists on the table. 'I'm not learning anything *dark*.'

Harry rolled his eyes.

\'Dark ice curses.\' Katie beamed. \'Great for creating beautiful icicles and impaling vulnerable first years who stray too far from their common rooms.\'

*So much for that not being funny.*

\'The Blasting Curse,\' Neville said. \'The Stunning Spell. And a good few more, nothing remotely dark.\'

*There is no light and dark.* Salazar\'s words echoed in Harry\'s head. *Only power and the intent that guides it.*

\'The Patronus Charm,\' Hermione said. \'Harry can cast a corporeal patronus. That would be very useful for all of us to know.\'

Harry frowned, recalling the sluggish pool of mist he'd managed in the maze. \'I can teach you the steps to cast it, but the form of your patronus is quite personal, so I\'d rather not display mine.\'

\'Then how do we know you can cast it?\' Terry Boot asked.

\'Only light wizards can cast a patronus,\' Smith muttered.

Harry leant across. \'Sorry, Katie,\' he whispered. \'I think it\'s too late for you.\'

She giggled. 'Oh well. Being evil's much more fun.'

\'I\'ve seen it,\' Hermione snapped. 'We *all* have in third year!'

\'The first meeting will be in a week, the same time as today,\' Neville said. \'If you can\'t make it, keep an eye on your badges for the next one and follow other members to our location.\' He pressed the tip of his wand to the badge, screwing his face up, and the numbers on the back of the badge blurred and changed.

*A week to think of a way to get hold of that list.* Harry allowed himself a small smile. *I'm sure Fleur can teach me anything I might need to know for the next step.*

The students drifted out in small groups, chattering amongst themselves.

\'What now?\' Katie asked. \'Want to stay, or head back?\'

\'I don\'t have much of a choice. I\'ve got that detention with Snape in his office today for an hour, and again every week for the foreseeable future whenever he can organise it.\'

\'I guess we should head back, then.\' Katie stood up and stumbled over her chair.

\'Too much to drink?\' Harry quipped.

Katie scowled. \'No. I\'m more careful now, after... well, you know when.\'

\'Yeah,\' Harry murmured. \'I know.'

\'Harry, wait!\' Hermione scooped her things into her bag, wincing at the sound of crumpling parchment, and jogged to catch them before they left.

\'What?\'

Hermione chewed at her lip. \'I spoke to Cedric about the third task. He says he remembers hearing the whistle and starting to run into the maze, then nothing until seeing you stun him.\'

\'That\'s unfortunate,\' Harry said. 'He's the only other one who was there and conscious.'

\'He does remember being told he was found unconscious next to Viktor and that his wand had been broken.\' Hermione crossed her arms. 'It doesn't add up.'

'Someone interfered.'

\'It doesn\'t make sense. His wand was snapped deliberately, but for no obvious reason.\'

*She\'s not going to let this go until Cedric is forced to remember what really happened, and I can\'t even dissuade her, because it will make me look suspicious.*

\'I only know what I saw,\' Harry said.

\'I know.\' She sighed. \'I\'m sorry to bring it up after everything that happened, but I *need* to know what happened to Viktor.\'

\'Most people who go digging don\'t find gold, Hermione,\' Katie said.

Hermione glared and stalked off.

\'Is that actually a saying?\' Harry asked.

\'I made it up,\' Katie replied. \'I thought it sounded good.\' \'I guess I\'ve heard worse.'

She swept her hair off her face and fixed him with a searching look. \'What actually happened in the maze? You were answering her questions very... *carefully*.\'

\'If you\'re worried I was responsible, don\'t be,\' Harry said. \'I know exactly what happened, but I took a risk to protect someone. Her digging's going to undo that and it\'s not going to benefit anyone. They'll get hurt and nobody else will really be affected.'

\'Cedric. You snapped his wand so nobody could see the spells it cast and stunned him.\' She scrunched her face up. \'Why're you helping him if he killed someone? What don\'t I know?\'

*No accusations\...* He swallowed a small lump of emotion. *I guess she really meant her promise.*

\'Cedric didn\'t do anything consciously. I obliviated him to spare him a lot of guilt.\'

'That was noble of you, Harry,\' she teased. \'Clearly you're still a Gryffindor at heart, your Supreme Dark Lordness. I won\'t tell anyone, either, of course.\'

\'As brainless and reckless as they come.\' Harry gave her a warm, half-smile. 'And thank you, Katie. I appreciate it. Seriously.\'

She beamed and turned a little red. \'So how come you\'re only teaching Neville and not me?\'

He led her back toward the castle. \'There'd be an outcry from the lower years if anyone caught wind of me teaching you anything. \'You\'ve terrified them all already, imagine how they\'d react if they thought I\'d been teaching you dark ice curses, too.\'

\'Angelina said you used the water conjuring spell,\' Katie

murmured. 'I can't really remember, though.'

\'I did.\' Harry grinned. \'But didn\'t you read what Rita Skeeter said? It was clearly a very dark curse, so I must have tricked her.\'

Katie pouted. \'You aren\'t going to tell me, are you?\'

\'It was an accident,\' Harry said. \'I wanted to drench him in water, but I was angry and I think I did some transfiguration by accident.\'

\'You must've been very angry about me being hurt to do accidental magic at fifteen, Harry.\' Katie batted her eyelashes and leant into his side. \'Is there something you need to tell Frenchie?\'

\'Only that she should feel free to throw fire at you.'

\'No seashell bra photos for you, then.' Katie turned towards the Owlery. \'I need to send a letter, have fun scrubbing things for Snape.'

\'I\'m sure I will.\'

Harry sighed and drifted through the corridors toward the dungeons. *What a waste of time. I didn't even intend to hurt Malfoy, just shut him up and get him out the way.*

\'You\'re late, Potter,\' Snape drawled from within his office. \'I got held up because of Professor Umbridge.\' Harry

glanced round the walls of the office.

Gleaming jars of potions' ingredients lined the black-painted walls from floor to ceiling.

*Ashwinder eggs\... Dragon\'s blood\... Dangerous stuff. Is Snape actually allowed to keep those here? Some random first year could just wander in and drink them.*

\'The headmaster is concerned by your recent spate of behaviour.\' Snape's expression remained neutral. \'He believes there is a connection between you and the Dark Lord, and that his emotions are influencing you through it.\'

*A connection?* Harry felt a little ice trickle through his veins.

*Are you sure he didn\'t mention anything about a piece of his soul being bound to me?*

\'He has decided it would be prudent for me to teach you more about the Mind Arts and show you how to block out the Dark Lord\'s influence.\' Snape fixed him with a piercing stare.

*Nice try.* Harry avoided eye contact.

Snape\'s lips curled into the slightest of smiles. \'He mentioned that you had something of an interest in them, though I\'m sceptical you've the emotional discipline required.\'

*Wait\...* Chill fingers groped their way down Harry\'s spine and into his gut. *If he's teaching me, will he have the chance to see my thoughts and memories? I\'ve come a long way, but my new technique hasn't been tested by anyone.*

\'How will you be teaching me?\' he asked.

\'I will attempt to breach your mind and you will *try* and keep me out.\' Snape sneered. 'It will doubtless be an unpleasant experience for both of us.'

*Merde. Nobody must know about Fleur or what I know.*

Harry reached down inside, past the heat and bliss of blue eyes and silver hair, through cold, clear, frozen rage, to that old, familiar void beneath. *Now you can have me, emptiness. Swallow me whole, so there's nothing to feel or see.*

Snape drew his wand. \'Clear your mind, Potter. However

you can.'

Harry let the abyss claw away everything. A distant, dazed,

emptiness flooded him and he dwindled into the distance as if he were drowning in the shadows between the shrinking stars. Endless solitary moments trickled into it like spilt ink down parchment.

\'Legilimens,\' Snape hissed.

A stabbing pain erupted in Harry\'s temples. *It's a long way away. Just pain.* He fed it into the void with everything else. *No more real than I am.*

Snape flinched and gritted his teeth. A handful of images welled to the surface of the abyss: a flash of red light amidst tombstones, blood on the kitchen knife clutched in Harry\'s small hand, and a glimmer of silver in the window of the Great Hall. The emptiness swallowed them back in with a vengeance.

'Bloody hell.' Snape broke the link and sagged over his desk.

'Sir?' Harry watched him release a long breath and draw himself up. 'Did something go wrong?'

\'That was *not* proper occlumency, Potter,\' he spat. \'I've never met a wizard who defends his mind by creating such an unbearable feeling in which to trap their opponent.\' His lips curled up again into that faint smile. \'It is quite unorthodox.\'

\'Thank you, sir,\' Harry replied.

\'How long have you been practising the Mind Arts, Potter?\' Snape asked.

\'A little over a year,\' Harry said. \'Once I understood the importance of focus and intent, I learnt some mental exercises in the muggle world, then continued learning more once I discovered Occlumency.\'

\'Then you've come a very long way in a very short time.'

\'It seems to come to me naturally.\' Harry shrugged. \'Maybe I

inherited a knack for it from my parents.'

*I inherited it from somewhere.*

Snape\'s upper lip curled. \'If you have, it wasn't from your father. James Potter didn't have the discipline or the subtlety that the mind arts require.\'

\'My mother, then,\' Harry said. 'Or maybe it just skipped a generation.'

\'You should be thankful you appear to be more like your mother than anyone realised,\' Snape murmured. 'She was an excellent witch.'

*Did he know her?* Harry studied the soft gleam in Snape's eyes. *They're about the same age, so they'd've been at Hogwarts together.*

Snape drew himself up and pulled an even expression across his face. \'I was supposed to teach you how to occlude your mind from the influence of the Dark Lord, but it seems you're already completely capable so long as you know to do it and he is not standing before you.\' Snape steepled his fingers. \'Unfortunately, the headmaster has insisted I keep you in detention for at least an hour every week until Christmas to help avoid external repercussions for your actions. We shall continue to practise your occlumency. It is of the utmost importance you're able to resist the Dark Lord.\'

\'Thank you, sir,\' Harry muttered.

Snape's lips twitched. \'You can go for today, Potter.'

*As long as I keep this up, he won't learn anything I don't want him to.* Harry stepped into the corridor. *And I might be able to learn something about what Dumbledore's up to from---*

\'Potter.\' Snape's face tightened and his lips paled. \'It\'s reassuring to see that you have not wasted as many years here as I thought, your mother would be proud of your recent improvements. Don\'t slide back into acting like your contemptible father.\'

*So he did know her.* Questions hovered on the tip of his tongue, then a bright flash of green light flickered through his thoughts. *It doesn't matter. They're dead*. *No amount of questions or wishing will change that. And I have new wishes. Wishes I need to make true.*

# Pink is the New Black

Umbridge's pale, wide face and saccharine smile covered the frontpage. Columns of type ran from the top of the page by her beret to her high, shining heels. In the light and crackle of the common room fire, the glint in her eyes held almost the same red gleam as Tom Riddle's.

*Educational decree twenty-five.* Harry skimmed the print. *Student-run organisations.* He tossed the paper into the common room fire. *Somebody talked. One of those two Ravenclaw girls who left with Cho, since it's been a few days and nobody's fallen afoul of Hermione's enchanted list.*

'Opportunity knocks.' He smiled and pulled out the Marauders' Map. 'Cho... Cho... There you are in the library.'

He stuck the map away and hurried off, disillusioning himself. *If Umbridge trusts her enough to get an education decree on the back of her word, she'll trust her when I need to bring Dumbledore's Army to her attention one day.*

Harry darted through the library door as Hermione shoved her way out bearing her bulging bag in both arms. He crept through the library shelves, sliding past a pair of sixth years, and found a seat with a good line of sight to Cho's fine, dark hair and her pair of friends.

*Marietta Edgecombe and Lisa Turpin. Could be either.* Harry judged his line of sight. *Marietta's easier to get.*

He palmed his wand in his sleeve and pointed its tip at Marietta. 'Legilimens.' Harry skimmed only the faintest amount of magic off for the spell.

A brief flutter of unintelligible images flashed before his eyes. *Too weak a connection.*

\'Legilimens,\' he murmured, drawing a little more magic.

A Ravenclaw boy's image hovered in her thoughts, his jawline, his eyes, his cheekbones, his hand clenched tight round his quill, and the web of veins running up the inside of his forearms.

*Cedric. Her best friend's boyfriend. Classy girl.*

Harry conjured up an impression of pink in his mind and slipped it in amongst Marietta's daydreams. Umbridge's face welled up. The taste of sugar-swamped, milk-drowned tea crept onto Harry's tongue and words spoken about an organisation created to flout the Ministry spilt from his lips.

*Perfect.* Harry smothered his satisfaction before it spread to Marietta and broke the connection. *Marietta will be the one who tells Umbridge.*

He slipped back out of the library past Marietta, who pressed her fingertips into her temples and winced.

'Are you ok?' Cho asked.

*I wouldn't fuss, Cho.* Harry glanced down the empty corridors, then dispelled his invisibility and headed back toward the common room. *She'd throw herself at Cedric the moment you turned your back if she thought he'd have her.*

Katie bounced round the corner from the staircase of Gryffindor Tower. \'How was Arithmancy this morning?\'

Harry grimaced. \'It\'s not easy and it\'s not as interesting as I hoped, but it isn\'t boring, either.\'

\'Like all subjects then.\' Katie beamed. \'It\'s not your strongest area, so I wouldn\'t worry about it.\'

\'I wasn\'t worrying. I\'m much better at Charms and Transfiguration, but Arithmancy's very useful. It\'s helpful in understanding why certain things happen in... some areas of magic.\'

*Rituals, warding, and enchantingmostly.*

\'Have you seen the Daily Prophet?\' Harry asked.

\'No?\' Katie's fingers curled 'round his wrist and her lips

twisted. \'Did you do something, Harry?\'

\'It\'s not to do with me.\' He screwed his face up. \'Well, it\'s not *directly* to do with me. I\'ll show you at lunch, someone always has a copy lying around to read while they eat.\'

She bobbed her head and tugged on Harry's arm, leading him past the unfortunate younger Creevey who'd both feet and an arm stuck in one of the trick steps.

'Confundo,' Harry murmured, wrapped his fingers 'round his

wand.

'Thank you!' Mini-Creevey cried. 'Thank you. Thank you. I've

been here for almost fifteen minutes.'

Katie laughed. 'Someone must've stuck him in it. Even Mini- Creevey can't have managed to get three limbs stuck on his own.'

'Ever had an unfortunate incident with a trick step?' Harry

asked.

'Got stuck in one after curfew once, but Alicia and Angelina

got me out.' A wicked glint rose in her mahogany eyes. 'Good thing it wasn't *you* with me. Who knows what sort of thing you'd've made

me do to get out? And what choice would poor, helpless me have had but to do *whatever* you wanted?'

Harry choked. 'What?'

'What?' Katie shot him an innocent look.

'*Someone* would kill both of us if anything like that

happened.'

Katie giggled. 'It'd be worth it.'

Harry chuckled. 'Not if you're not in that seashell bra.' 'I doubt I'd be in *any* bra in that sort of situation,' she

murmured. 'It'd probably be one of the first things you'd want me to take off.'

'I think you've forgotten about a large number of portraits who'd be watching us the whole time,' Harry quipped. 'You'd be joining me in detention with Snape every week.'

Katie wrinkled her nose. 'Urgh. Yeah. Wouldn't want any of them seeing me with my boobs out.' She tugged him by his wrist to the nearest empty seat, shooing second years further up the table. \'So what\'s happened?\'

Harry glanced down the table, caught sight of an unattended paper and stuck out his hand, shaping his magic for the summoning charm.

Katie blinked and beamed. \'That\'s really impressive,\' she gushed. \'You\'re so powerful and brilliant, my lord.\' She lowered her voice to a whisper. 'No need to worry about seashell bras getting in the way if you can summon them off, huh, Harry?'

Harry snorted and cut himself a slice of pie. \'Hush, you. It\'s taken me hours and hours of being too lazy to get up and carry books around to be able to do that, I\'m allowed to show it off.\'

\'How many hours?\' Katie stole his pie and unfolded the Daily Prophet over the top of it.

He cut himself another slice. \'Probably at least ten. I kept trying it without my wand until I could remember the shape and intent of the magic well enough. It\'s like learning drills for quidditch, you have to do it so many times it sinks in and becomes a reflex.\'

Katie waved her fork at the teacher's table. \'So it probably took Dumbledore hours of practice to be able to light the candles on his lectern like he does to impress the first years every year.\'

Harry laughed. \'I\'d never thought about that, but yes, probably.\'

\'So what did you want to show me?\' Katie flicked back through the pages from the quidditch results. 'Haven't seen anything particularly shocking except for the Chudley Cannons managing their only win of the season.'

Harry turned the paper round and tapped Umbridge's face with his finger. 'That.'

\'Educational Decree Twenty-Five,\' Katie read. \'That doesn\'t sound good.\'

\'Every student run club or organisation has to apply to her for permission to continue.\' Harry took a mouthful of pie, savouring the rich taste of gravy.

Katie dropped her fork into her lap and went pale as a sheet. \'The quidditch team....'

Harry chuckled and choked on his pie. He coughed until a few crumbs came back up out of his lungs and swallowed hard. \'The *DA*. Someone must've told her and she must've written to Fudge to try and stop it.\'

\'Since when were we calling it the DA?\' Katie asked.

\'Do you want to be heard talking about Dumbledore\'s Army and get sent to see Umbridge?\' Harry asked.

Katie pouted. \'Not when you put it like that. I\'ve not seen anything of Umbridge today, though, and apparently she wasn\'t in her class this morning.\'

Harry hid a smile. \'Has anyone had detention with her recently?\'

\'Colin Creevey. Again.\' Her eyes widened. \'You tampered

with her quill... You don\'t think that\'s why, do you?\'

Harry allowed himself a small cold smile. \'I hope it is, otherwise she\'s probably causing trouble for someone somewhere.\'

\'Maybe she\'s redecorating her office,\' Katie suggested. \'It\'s about time someone pointed out to her how hideous it is.\'

\'Maybe that\'s why Creevey had detention,\' Harry murmured.

He chuckled into his pie. \'She probably has *I must not criticise the colour pink* permanently scarred into her hand now.'

Katie screwed her face up. \'So who do you think told her?\'

\'Nobody whose name's on that list,\' Harry said. \'Otherwise we'd know.\'

\'Well, we aren\'t likely to find out who, then.\' Katie growled.

'Damn.'

\'You\'ll have to settle for hexing firsties,\' Harry said.

A group of first years edged a little further down the table, tugging their plates with them. Katie glanced after them and giggled.

'There you are.' Nev collapsed onto the bench beside him. \'I\'ve been looking for you since the end of your first class.\'

Harry raised an eyebrow. \'Why?\'

\'You said you\'d have a look at my shield charm for me,\' Nev said. \'And now I have to teach it to a load of people, I need you to do it soon.\'

\'Well, if you come with me in a moment, I\'ll take a look in an empty classroom,\' Harry said.

*And by that, I mean Umbridge's classroom.* He stifled a thin, cool smile. *Let's see if she's fallen afoul of her own quill yet.*

\'Thanks.\' Nev released a long sigh. \'I don\'t know why it trembles, it\'s like I can\'t quite get my magic to do what I want.\'

\'Hopefully, we can figure it out. Have you decided what you\'re going to teach first?\'

\'The shield charm, then a few of the jinxes,\' Nev helped himself to the Daily Prophet and frowned. \'Have you seen this?\'

\'Yeah.\' Harry nodded. 'Someone ratted us all out to Umbridge, I\'ve not seen any hint of Hermione's curse, though.\'

Nev grimaced. \'Looks like we\'ll have to be careful, then.'

*A good reason to give me the list, maybe?* Harry weighed up the risk. *No, better to get him to hide it somewhere he thinks I don't*

*know, but can still find. Can't have myself turning up as a suspect*

*later.*

\'Keep an eye out for anyone who doesn\'t come to the first meeting and then take their badge back if they\'ve backed out,\' Katie said. 'If Umbridge knows about a few of us and gets her hands on that badge, she'll manage to track us all down.\'

\'Where\'s the list?\' Harry injected a trace of worry into his tone. 'We can't have her finding that and I'd bet she'll be after the power to go through everyone's stuff soon, if she's not already.'

\'Hermione has it,\' Nev said.

*Hermione... She'll figure out it's something to do with me if I'm more than half-involved.* Harry wracked his brain. *Let's see if I can get Nev to put in the Room of Requirement's room of hidden things. He might've discovered it if I'm lucky, otherwise, I'll need to choose my words carefully so he goes looking.*

\'Make sure she hides it somewhere safe,\' he said. \'Umbridge will be looking for any proof the group still exists and she'll be able to go through all our stuff and anywhere teachers can get if she asks Fudge for more decrees. The meetings are safe since we\'re in the Room of Requirement, but that list will get us all on Umbridge\'s detention roster.' Harry hid a small smile. 'Hermione\'ll want to find a room where it'll stay hidden.\'

Nev blinked, then grinned. \'I know where she can hide it. If we\'re safe in the room, then the list will be too, right?\'

\'I guess.\' Harry buried a quiet sense of satisfaction behind a shrug. \'If there\'s a place to hide things.\'

*All it will take is a few words to find their way to Umbridge about a room of hidden things on the seventh floor that appears*

*when you need it, then that list and I will be a step away from being able to act.* Harry finished the last few mouthfuls of his pie while Katie interrogated Neville about the Room of Requirement in heated whispers. *Things are starting to fall into place*. *Once Dumbledore and Umbridge are off my back, I can see Fleur more often and go find out about that prophecy.*

\'Coming, Nev?\' Harry watched Umbridge take her seat on the staff table out of the corner of his eye. He glimpsed a clean, white bandage wrapped around her right hand.

*Perfect.* The corner of his mouth curved up a fraction and the same quiet sense of satisfaction coiled in his breast. *Let's find out what she got Creevey to carve into her own hand.*

\'Yeah.\' Nev straightened his robes and stood up. \'I\'m

coming.\'

\'What about me?\' Katie demanded. 'Just because I refused

to let you do whatever you wanted to me if I got stuck in a trick step, you're going to ditch me?' She made her lip wobble and bowed her head. 'Fine, if that's what it takes, Harry. I'll let you have your way with me *however* you like.'

Nev turned bright red from his chin to the roots of his hair.

Harry laughed. \'You're terrible, Katie. Nev might explode if you keep saying things like that.' He patted her on the top of the head. 'You\'ve got Charms now, anyway. Nev and I are free for the rest of the day.\'

\'I've got Herbology last thing, actually,\' Nev muttered.

\'Well *I\'m* free all day.\' Harry smirked and waved goodbye to

Katie.

Harry.'

She shot him a playful glower and winked. 'Catch me later,

He drifted through the corridors toward Umbridge's room.

\'Which empty classroom?\' Nev glanced into every single

one they passed. 'There's loads...'

\'This one.\' Harry grinned and ushered him into Umbridge\'s room, pulling the invisibility cloak out from under his robes.

\'Not *again*, Harry,\' Nev moaned.

Harry slipped into Umbridge\'s office. The pink drapes were askew, a handful of telling gaps marred the collection of decorative china pieces on the walls, and a small stack of parchment rested on the corner of her desk. A single line of rust-brown writing marked the top of the first.

*I mustn't blindly believe the lies of others*. He released a soft laugh and slipped back out of the office. *Perfect.*

\'Are you done?\' Nev demanded.

\'I haven\'t done anything,\' Harry said. \'I just wanted to see

what Creevey had written. I suspect it's left an *impression.*\'

Neville fought a smile. 'I hope it didn't do too much damage, though. That'll just make things worse.'

Harry waved his hand at Nev and sat on the nearest desk.

\'Show me your shield, then.'

\'Protego,\' Neville intoned, raising and waving his wand.

A glowing wall of silver light sprang up around him. Faint tremors rippled through it every few seconds, moving in random directions like gusts of wind across the surface of the lake.

\'I d-don\'t know what\'s wrong with it,\' Nev muttered. \'My pronunciation, m-my wand motion, and my intent are all clear.\'

*They were all fine.* Harry touched his wand to the shield and closed his eyes. *It's malformed. Twisted. His intent and everything's clear, but the magic comes out warped.*

'Any idea?' Nev released his shield with a low gasp and let

his wand drop.

*That\'s his father\'s wand*. *Maybe it's not the best fit, like*

*Salazar said mine might not be after the ritual.*

'One,\' he said. \'Try not to be offended.\'

\'I-I\'m not g-good enough to do it, am I?\' Nev muttered.

\'If I\'m right about what\'s wrong then it can easily be fixed,\' Harry said. 'It looks like something's going wrong with your magic after you've cast the spell. Which means it's not your fault.' He pointed his own wand at Nev's. 'That's your father\'s wand, right?\'

Nev nodded.

\'It\'s possible that your problem is due to using a wand that isn\'t quite right for you,\' Harry said. \'You're unlikely to be perfectly suited to your father\'s wand and you might be better off getting one of your own.\'

Nev\'s eyes blazed and his knuckles tightened on the wand

until they whitened. \'There\'s nothing wrong with the wand.'

*Touchy subject.*

\'Here.\' Harry held out his own. 'Try using mine.\'

Nev took his wand and raised it. \'Protego.'

A faint shimmer of silver light surrounded him.

Nev hissed with pain and dropped Harry\'s wand on the desk. \'It burnt me!\' He turned his hand to show Harry the thin red mark along the length of his palm. 'See?'

\'Sorry.\' Harry retrieved his wand. Memories of Bertha Jorkins' failed fire spell and her weak conjured ropes rose from the back of his mind. \'I think it\'s quite strongly bonded to me. It doesn't play well with others.\'

\'I take your point about not using a wand that isn\'t suited to you.\' Nev laughed and winced, rubbing at the burn mark. \'I\'ll talk to Gran about it, if I find a wand better suited to me at Ollivander\'s then maybe that will fix things.\'

\'It should help you with everything,\' Harry said. \'A wand's the conduit through which you use your magic, the better matched to you it is, the easier you'll find performing magic.\'

\'That makes sense,\' Nev murmured. \'But still...\'

Harry glanced between the wand and the faint gleam of disappointment in Nev's eyes. \'Just because you\'re not a perfect match for his wand, doesn't mean he wouldn\'t be proud of you. You\'re like your father *and* your mother, Nev. You\'ll need something in between them both.\'

Nev slid his father\'s wand into the pocket of his robes. 'Did

you have any other suggestions?\'

*No, but this is as good a moment as any to try and convince you to take up occlumency.* Harry calculated the risk. *It'll benefit him as well as me, I'm hardly taking advantage, even if I'm not being completely honest.*

'It\'s possible you aren\'t quite focused enough; there's a branch of magic I can teach you that can help. It\'s not easy to learn, though, and you\'d have to keep it a secret that I taught you.\'

\'It\'s not something dark, is it?\' Nev's voice wavered.

Harry laughed. \'No. It\'s called Occlumency and it\'s about organising your thoughts and controlling your emotions. It\'s meant to protect your mind, but the basic principles are very helpful for focusing your intent and that\'s why most wizards learn it.\' He caught and held Nev's eyes. \'I can teach it to you, it\'s not dark, just a bit obscure. Voldemort's supposed to be very good at its opposite, which is why I\'m learning it.\'

\'I want to learn it,\' Nev said. \'If it helps me perform magic better and stops wizards attacking my mind, then I should learn it.\'

*Perfect. I didn't even really have to lie.*

\'It won\'t be easy to learn. It can be painful and you need to trust me.\'

\'I trust you. You've not led me wrong yet. I\'ll learn it however

you think is best.\'

*I wish I didn't have to deceive him.* Harry smothered a soft swell of sadness, but Fleur's blue eyes and delicate pout hovered before the eye of his mind. *I can't tell him about Fleur, though. If word gets out, someone will try and take her away from me. Someone always does.*

\'When do we start?\' Nev asked.

Harry stifled a sigh and drew himself up. \'You've got to do the first bit yourself. Practice emptying your thoughts, forcing your mind to go blank, even when you\'re angry, or upset.\'

\'I\'ll finally have something useful to do in Umbridge\'s lessons,\' Nev muttered.

Harry chuckled. \'Yes, I suppose you will.\'

\'Let\'s leave before Umbridge gets back,\' Nev said. \'I need to nip to the hospital wing for this burn and start planning some teaching.\'

\'I\'m sure you\'ll think of something.'

\'You\'re my assistant,\' Nev said. 'This is on you, too.'

\'We both know that\'s just an excuse to get me in so I can teach you all the Patronus Charm.\' Harry shot him a grin. \'How long did Hermione bug you about it before you gave in?\'

\'She might've mentioned it a few times.'

\'Thought so.\' A small smile curved Harry's lips. 'Knowing her, she's probably been trying to do it since I did it. She hates it when anyone manages to do something she can't.'

*She didn't have any friends before Ron and I. And we always asked her for help.* A small stab of guilt pierced his gut. *I suppose she must've mistaken that for friendship. Not so smart at everything in the end, huh. She just had to be there when we needed her. That's all.*

Nev nudged his arm. \'You\'re not coming to many of the

meetings, are you?'

\'Of course not,\' Harry said. \'I don\'t have any reason to help them. I've not forgotten how quickly they turned on me during the tournament, no doubt the moment it becomes convenient, they'll do it again. I\'ll join and teach the patronus because dementors are horrible creatures and you can\'t use that charm against me, but that's about all I'm helping them with. I owe them nothing.\'

*That's what they wanted me to be, after all.*

\'Will you at least come to the first meeting?\' Nev asked. \'I\'ll come to the first one and whichever one you want to

learn the patronus in, but that\'s all I'm promising. I don\'t have time to

waste, Nev. Voldemort\'s not going to wait for me to get stronger.\'

\'I understand.\' Nev headed toward the hospital wing. \'I\'ll see you later.\'

Harry nodded and hurried toward Myrtle\'s bathroom. *Now I just have to start finding out about that prophecy. Once I know why Voldemort's after me and have Dumbledore and Umbridge out the way, I can start doing something about it.*

\'Myrtle?\' Harry glanced around.

\'Harry!\' She zipped out of her cubicle and across the flooded bathroom floor to hover in front of him.

\'How've you been? You haven\'t been here the last few times

I\'ve come.\'

\'I don\'t spend *all* my time here, Harry. There\'s all sorts of interesting places to go if you know. I saw that red-headed boy you came here with in the second year in the prefect\'s bathroom a few days ago. He has freckles *everywhere.\'* She giggled. 'That nice

Hufflepuff boy, too. He ran out of bubbles last year when he was

trying to solve that egg clue, you know.'

Harry shuddered. \'I\'m glad you\'ve been having fun, Myrtle.\'

She drifted a little closer to him. \'Nobody's come looking around here,\' she whispered. \'But nobody ever comes in here except you anyway. I always know if anyone comes in here\'

\'Thanks, Myrtle.\' He flashed her a smile and opened the entrance to the chamber.

\'What's down there?\' Myrtle peered into the dark, a strange expression crossing her face. 'I feel like I ought to know, really, but I don't remember anything about it.'

Harry grinned. \'Nothing anywhere near as interesting as the boys in the Prefect\'s Bathroom I assure you. Just some old statues and a bit of space for me to relax.\' He picked his way across the puddle and disappeared down the stairs towards the chamber.

\'I\'m back, Salazar!'

\'So it would seem.' Salazar squinted down at him through the coils of his serpent. 'I was having a nice nap.' He peeled the snake off. 'Although, this wretched creature has mistaken itself for a nightcap again.'

Harry watched Salazar rearrange his serpent. \'I need to

speak to Sirius, but afterward, I've a few questions.'

He fished Sirius\' mirror out of the top drawer of Salazar's desk and walked back over the bridge, conjuring a seat up and turning his back toward one of the dark alcoves. *There, Sirius can't see anything particularly suspicious now, just in case he says anything to Dumbledore.*

'Sirius,' Harry murmured at the mirror.

Condensation crept across the glass, then it flared white and his godfather\'s face appeared.

\'Harry!\' Sirius grinned, displaying sparkling white teeth. Fewer lines marked his skin than last Harry'd seen him, his cheeks weren't quite so hollow, his hair neater, and the shadows under his eyes had lessened.

'How've you been?' Harry returned his grin. 'Cleaned out the

whole house yet?\'

\'No,\' Sirius grumbled. \'Gave up a few days back when I discovered that Kreacher was just keeping every single artefact we tried to throw away. Bloody place. Wish I could burn the whole thing down to the ground some days.\'

\'Kreacher?\'

\'House-elf,\' Sirius said. \'He comes with the house and knows too much for us to free him or send him away. He'd just pop right off to Cissy.\'

*Whoever that is.*

Harry wracked his brain for a way to direct the conversation to Dumbledore. \'So what are you doing if you aren\'t tidying?\'

\'I\'m organising the members of the Order who help out down at the Department of Mysteries.' Sirius winced. 'Which I was explicitly told not to mention to you. Oops.'

*Now that sounds interesting.*

\'What\'s down there?\' Harry asked.

'Sorry, Harry.\' Sirius gave him a rueful grin. \'Dumbledore

was adamant about not telling, I was outvoted.\'

Harry frowned. \'If it involves me, then I think I deserve to know. I've had to do a lot of adult stuff already, it's a bit late to try and play the *you're just a kid* card.'

\'I\'m on your side,\' Sirius said. \'But they made me promise.\' \'Well our conversations are going to be short then, since

nobody wants to tell me anything.' Harry scowled and swallowed

down a cold ball of rage. 'I haven\'t even spoken to Dumbledore *all year*. I nearly killed a student by accident and he sent me a note telling me I have detention.\'

\'I heard about that.\' Sirius grinned. \'That Malfoy kid probably deserved it, especially if he\'s anything like his father. Don't know what Cissy was thinking, marrying that slime.\'

*Cissy's Malfoy's mother?* Harry tried to picture her. An image of Lucius Malfoy with breasts and high heels flitted through his mind. *And that's enough of that.*

\'He\'s a lot like his father,\' he said.

\'You should've finished him off, then,\' Sirius muttered. \'One

less potential Death Eater.\'

Harry snorted. \'Malfoy'd make a poor Death Eater. He doesn\'t have the guts to do anything more than run his mouth.\'

Sirius' expression darkened. \'You\'d be surprised. Lucius doesn\'t seem like all that much either, all pretty robes and words, but I have it on good authority that he\'s quite a handful in a duel. He curses first, then claims the Imperius Curse made him do it later.\'

Sirius chuckled and his face lightened a fraction. \'What're you doing

at Hogwarts? Carried out any nefarious plans that I\'d be proud of?\'

*Oh yes.* Harry allowed himself a small smile. *You might not be so proud of them, though.*

\'You can\'t smile like that and stay silent!\' Sirius rubbed his hands together with a gleeful grin. \'Spill.\'

*Sirius likes an eye for an eye, he'll appreciate what I did to*

*the quill.*

\'I got Umbridge again.\' \'What did you do?\'

Harry pressed his lips into a thin line. \'She has an enchanted

quill she uses to make students write lines with. It etches the words written into the back of the hand and writes in blood.\'

Sirius\' smile froze. \'That woman has been *torturing* students!

I\'m going to *murder* Dumbledore, he said everything's in hand!\'

\'She won\'t be doing it again, not if she\'s learnt her lesson.\' \'What did you do?\' his godfather demanded. \'I hope it was

bad.\'

\'I changed the enchantments on the quill.\' Harry stifled a

thin, cold smile. \'It changed its source to the creator rather than the user. She\'s been wearing a bandage around her hand today.\'

'Good. Bitch deserves it. She's the reason Moony can't get a

job.'

*Wherever he's gone. Probably off somewhere doing something for Dumbledore. Haven't heard from him in over a year. Some friend of the family he is.*

\'She banned me from playing quidditch for life,\' Harry said. \'That was for cursing Malfoy.\'

Salazar's muffled yells drifted from study.

\'I\'d better go,\' Harry said.

\'It does sound like something\'s happening.' Sirius cocked his

head. \'Lots of shouting about something.\'

\'We\'ll talk again soon.' Harry rolled his eyes. \'Maybe I\'ll be

able to be briefed by then.\'

Sirius nodded, shadows hovering in his eyes. \'See you soon,

Harry.\'

The mirror went blank.

*No luck. Just something about the Department of Mysteries,*

*whatever that is.* Harry stalked into the study.

'Done chatting?' Salazar demanded.

\'You're not my supervisor.' Harry glared at the painting and

crossed his arms.

The snake stared back, flickering its forked tongue at him.

'Well?' Salazar tossed the serpent over his shoulder. 'What're you focusing on?'

\'I need to find out about the Department of Mysteries and get better at duelling.\' Flashes of the hail of curses Voldemort had unleashed streaked past Harry's mind's eye. 'A *lot* better.'

\'Can you defend your mind?\' Salazar asked. 'No point being able to duel if you can't do that.'

\'Yes.\' A quiet satisfaction coiled in Harry's chest. 'My idea's not... pleasant, but it works. While I feel nothing and think of nothing, anything they try to see or show me is lost in that too. I just have to make sure they can't follow the void, but Snape couldn't endure the feeling, so I doubt anyone would chase it.'

\'What about your legilimency?\'

\'I\'ve convinced Neville to let me teach him. I've got the hang of how to do things, I just need practice.\' Harry sat on the edge of the desk. \'So, duelling?\'

\'There're ways to improve yourself to give you an advantage.' Salazar's green eyes bored into Harry's. \'Your eyesight's a weakness, your glasses could easily be exploited by an unscrupulous foe, and the faster your reflexes and greater your strength, the better you'll fare.\'

\'More rituals?\' Harry turned the idea over in his head. 'Fine.'

*It's just power.* Fleur's face floated behind his closed eyes. *I intend to use it to keep hold of the one perfect wish that came true, nothing more.*

Salazar stroked his goatee and the serpent's head rose up over his shoulder, its eyes fixed on Harry. \'We\'ll use blood as a medium, of course, but you\'ll have to get your hands on some magical ingredients. We can create a ritual to imbue certain properties unto yourself.\'

\'What'll the sacrifice be?\' Harry asked.

\'Nothing too dear,\' Salazar murmured. \'Time. Blood. Pain.

Guilt. Innocence. All things worth trading to survive.\' \'What will I need?\'

\'Wormwood and bayberry to fix your eyesight.' Salazar fixed Harry with a long look. 'Griffon's claw and salamander\'s blood to improve your physical body.\'

Harry frowned. 'How does it actually work?'

'It's all about intent.' Salazar pushed his snake's head back down onto his shoulder with one finger. 'Wormwood, bayberry, griffons, and salamanders all come with certain mental associations. You'll form these for yourself reading about them, if you don't already have them. The intent of your magic will be created from the runes you write, the relative arithmantic properties of the ritual pattern design, and your mental associations of the objects within it. Very complex pieces of magic require a complicated mix of intentions and no small amount of power. A spell is a single spike of intent, even spells like the killing curse only require simple intent, just in very potent amounts. A ritual is a swirling ball of intentions, too complex to be cast as a spell. There're very few wizards with the knowledge, skill, and power to carry out more than the most basic rituals. Even fewer of those can truly muster the will and intent to carry them out.'

*So it's not about what I'm using, but how I perceive it.* Harry nodded. *Makes sense. My intent's based on what I know and think.*

\'Will it be enough?\'

A bitter laugh slipped from Salazar's lips. \'It's *never* enough, I can assure you of that. Once you get a taste for it, there's always one more thing you can do, one more piece of magic to try.' He

sighed. 'But yes. We will fix your eyesight, then give you an edge

over most other wizards by enchanting your physical body.\'

'Right.' Harry stared at his hands. 'And how does *that* work?

I'm not going to end up hideously deformed like Voldemort, am I?'

Salazar chortled. 'Not if you do it right. It's magic, you're imbued with the traits we will create. Very few *physical* changes will occur, but you will gain magical abilities other wizards only dream of.' Salazar paused and drummed his fingers upon his snake's head. 'Most of them *can* only dream of it.' He gave Harry a soft smile. 'I've not taught this to you as I usually would out of necessity, but understand, Harry, that being able to do magic like this places you in exalted company. And deservedly so.'

'So I just have to find that list of things.'

\'You\'ll need a lot of blood, too,\' Salazar said. \'There are many runes to write and the blood must be fresh to work best as a medium. It'd be wise to do the rituals separately. Your eyesight's the most pressing concern.\'

Harry gestured at the bag of galleons he\'d won from the Triwizard Tournament. 'I can probably buy most of those, they're common enough potions ingredients.'

'Potions aren't so different to rituals,' Salazar said. 'It doesn't matter what you toss into the cauldron, it's all about what you intend it to do.' He scowled and crossed his arms. 'In the end, unfortunately, Godric and Rowena are right. All magic's basically enchanting, imbuing something with intent-directed magic.'

'What about duelling itself?' Harry spun his wand round in his hand. 'You must've done some. You're *Salazar Slytherin.*'

Salazar cackled. 'I won a fair few. Power. Talent. Speed.

Knowledge. Efficiency. They're the staples of duelling. Unpredictability and cunning raises you above the rest.' He rubbed his chin. 'Practise turning one wand-motion into the next, the flick of the wrist for the Blasting Curse can easily transition into the curve of the Bone-Splintering curse. What do you remember of Voldemort? The two of you share similar strengths.\'

Harry swallowed a bitter lump. *I'm stuck emulating him. So be it. I'll be the wizard he chose not to be.*

\'He deflected almost everything I sent at him that was

blockable,' he said.

\'Mastering how to deflect hexes would combine very well with your ridiculous butterfly conjuring defence. The intent behind those ludicrous insects will direct them to swallow curses like the Killing Curse and you can deflect anything else back out at your opponents. Almost anything that isn\'t an Unforgivable can be deflected if your intent is strong enough and you're fast enough.\'

\'I\'ll practise,\' Harry said. 'Fleur's a duellist. She must know how to deflect.'

\'Don't get too distracted by the pretty French witch.' Salazar fixed him with a piercing stare. 'You'll die, then she'll go and find herself another man, and you'll have to watch him steal your dream from the afterlife.'

A shadow wrapped its arms about Fleur in Harry's mind. She offered it her warm smile and her cute pout, the sweetness of her kisses, and the quiet, perfect intimacy beneath willow leaves and summer sun. *Never.* A thick, twisted heat smouldered in Harry's heart and his stomach bubbled and churned. *Nobody's stealing our perfect dream from us.*

\'Thanks,\' he muttered. \'I\'m going to go to the library and read about those ingredients, then see if there's anything about the Department of Mysteries.'

# The Great Escape

Frost crept up the walls. A thin, clear film curled past Bella's toes, shining in the light of the half moon. Her breath misted and goosebumps rose along her arms.

A shadow drifted past the bars of her cell and the chill seeped into her blood.

'Cissy's going to scream,' Bella muttered. A deep, soft despair crept up inside, closing over her like high, dark waves. She blew a long pale cloud out across her room and let her sister's shriek ring in her ears. 'Poor Cissy.' She giggled. 'Poor us, Bell.'

*Definitely poor us, Bella.* Bella swiped frost off the polished wall and stared into the blurred violet glow of her eyes. *Cissy's out there having fun without us. Andi, too.*

The door shivered, then melted away like candle wax; it pooled on the floor like spilt water, dark as ink in the moonlight from the window.

*Like blood.* Bella bounced across and crouched down, poking a finger into it. Pain flashed up her arm, sweet as honey melting on her tongue.

'Ow.' She pouted. 'Hot.'

'Bella.' A soft, cool whisper drifted to her ears. 'Aren't you bored of being in here?'

She giggled. 'Yes, my lord.'

Crimson eyes opened in the doorway, dark robes gathered beneath the slitted pupils, swirling together like thick, black smoke

caught on the breeze. A long-fingered, pale-skinned hand reached

out of the shadows. 'Time to go, then.'

'Time to play,' Bella sang. She extended her arm.

The tip of the Dark Lord's wand traced the ink serpent beneath her skin; it writhed and stung, then there was a soft snap and the walls of her room vanished.

A huddle of ragged-robed, limp-haired, dirt-crusted people stumbled and staggered across a polished marble floor. Moonlight spilt through the circular, domed window at the centre of the frescoed ceiling, bathing them all in cold, clear light.

*They all need a bath.* She raised an arm and sniffed her armpit.

*We need a bath, too, Bell.*

A thick-bearded, gaunt man twisted round. 'Lestrange.' His eyes swept over her, small, hot, and beady. 'You're looking surprisingly good. I see what Rookwood meant. Fancy spending some time?'

Heat bubbled beneath Bella's skin. A ripple of magic flashed out from her; it smashed the man away across the floor. He skidded into the wall and curled into a ball.

'Bella,' the Dark Lord murmured. 'We don't throw our own pieces off the board, do we?'

'No.' She pouted and stuck her finger out at the crumpled figure. 'But they weren't looking at me very nicely, so it's their fault.'

Silk whispered across the floor behind her. A faint heat curled

over her skin. Purple silk so dark it was near black swept 'round her.

'A new dress.' The Dark Lord stepped past her into the centre of the beam of moonlight and slid his wand back into his sleeve. 'To prevent any further mistakes from your comrades.'

The huddle staggered away into a ragged circle. Trembling limbs and dull, glazed eyes ringed the Dark Lord's crimson gaze and tall, slim, pale figure.

*There're no comrades here, Bell. Only other players. One*

*better, the rest worse.*

'Thank you, my lord.' Bella admired the cut and fit of the sleeves. 'It's pretty.'

The Dark Lord paused and extended one open palm. 'Not so beautiful as these must seem to you all.'

Wands spun into existence in the air over his fingers. Sparks of silver, green, blue, red, and yellow fountained off them as they drifted back to their owners. Low cries, gasps, and sobs filled the air beneath the frescoed ceiling. A familiar curved, dark wand slapped back into Bella's palm. Faint heat met the skin of her hand.

*Now we're ready to play, Bell.* She slipped the wand through the waist of her dress. *Nearly ready, Bella. We've got weaker stuck in there. Not our magic, or our vessel, but our touch has rusted.*

'Severus has made you all a number of restorative potions,' the Dark Lord said. 'But you all deserve far more than that. Unlike other, *weaker,* wizards and witches, you remained true. You failed me, yes, but you stood by me as you promised you would.' He spun, his thin lips curling back into a cold grin. 'And now I am returned, you are free, and we can begin anew.'

Whispers washed round the circle. A low murmur swelled into a gentle roar.

Bella giggled beneath her breath. 'The game begins.' The Dark Lord raised his hand. 'Go, all of you save

Augustus, Rabastan, Rodolphus, and Bella. There are empty rooms

aplenty here. *Rest*. Regain your strength, my loyal followers, and

wash the chill of Azkaban from yourselves.'

The circle shuffled away into the shadows. Three figures stumbled forward.

The Dark Lord's crimson gaze passed over them. 'I am disappointed in the three of you.'

Strange boy and his brother quailed.

The other grimaced. 'What about Bella, my lord? She failed

too!'

'Bella's instructions were clear. She was meant to cause

distraction and death enough to hide the importance of the child's end.' The Dark Lord's tone sharpened. 'You were simply meant to kill the Longbottom child, not dally and torment his family instead. The boy still lives, though it matters not now. I care not for your means, my followers, but if they forfeit me my ends, then you will face my wrath.'

'Apologies, my lord.' Strange boy bowed from the waist.

'We lost ourselves in victory.'

'And how did the last thirteen years of victory taste, Rodolphus?' The Dark Lord's wand slipped from his sleeve. 'Was it *sweet*?'

Strange boy shook his head so hard the bones of his neck

cracked. 'No, my lord. We won't fail again.'

'See that you do not.' The Dark Lord drew his wand through the air, shining metal streamed from the end like ink from a quill's tip, hovering, then coalescing into three rune-engraved silver masks. 'Rabastan and Rodolphus, take your masks and go. You failed, but remained loyal and did not denounce me under any threat or torment. Your place at my side and all I promised is still yours to claim.' The masks wavered like a distant mirage upon desert heat haze. '*Provided* you don't fail again.'

Strange boy and his brother snatched the silver masks from the air and hurried away into the dark of a corridor.

'My lord?' The final figure's voice shook. 'I have not betrayed you, my lord.'

'No, Augustus. I seek answers from you. Answers I ought to have sought from you before.' The Dark Lord's wand tip drifted up to hover before the figure's forehead. 'Answers *you* ought to have brought to *me* before.'

'I have no secrets from you, my lord,' Augustus mumbled.

The Dark Lord's wand vanished into his sleeve. The silver mask hung in the air, like a butterfly pinned to white parchment. 'Tell me, then, Augustus. The Department of Mysteries and the Hall of Prophecies within, how are they protected?'

'To my knowledge, there's relatively little.' Rookwood edged forward into the moonlight. His adam's apple bobbed like a fishing lure upon river ripples. 'You can reach the department so long as you can enter the ministry, an easy feat for anyone with inside contacts. Malfoy must have some.'

The Dark Lord's eyes narrowed. 'I did not ask for a plan, Augustus, merely the magical defences surrounding my prize.'

'Sorry, my lord.' Rookwood shivered. 'My mind. That place...' '*Focus.*' The Dark Lord's eyes glowed a soft, hypnotic red. 'The door is heavily warded, but deactivating a few key wards

renders it vulnerable to potent destructive magics like fiendfyre.

There's an enchantment on the corridor beyond it, I don't know its exact nature, something to do with the torches, but it keeps you walking in circles forever if you don't break it.' Rookwood shuddered. 'They're more worried about keeping people from getting *in,* my lord. The artefacts within are considered so dangerous they need little defence, but no doubt there are wards to guard against tampering.' His gaze flicked from side to side and he licked his lips. 'Prophecies can only be taken by the hand of the one whom they're about, my lord. And I fear it would be beyond any but you to break that piece of magic.'

Bella huffed. 'I could.'

*We definitely could, Bella.*

Rookwood's lip curled. 'A mad bitch like you? You've no understanding of the subtleties of the Department of Mysteries.'

Heat boiled in Bella's blood. A shimmer of air slammed into a shining silver shield formed of countless slithering serpents.

'Bella,' the Dark Lord chided. '*Behave*.'

The shield faded.

*Aww[www.](http://www/) It was pretty.*

'And Augustus.' The Dark Lord raised a long, pale finger. 'Don't be so foolish as to underestimate Bella. I have no other follower so useful as she is. It will be her honour to find the prophecy for me. Take your mask, Augustus. You have three days to rest, then you will seek out Lucius and aid him in infiltrating the department.

Ensure you tell Lucius he will be accompanied by Bella when he goes. I will take a look at the wards upon the doorway myself and tell you how best to dismantle them.'

Rookwood swallowed. 'Yes, my lord.' He bowed low,

grabbed his silver mask from the air, and scurried away.

The Dark Lord reached out to cup her cheek with his long fingers. His red eyes swept over her, a glint of curiosity in them. 'Bella. You've fared well. I feared Azkaban's wards and the lack of magic might do you harm.'

Bella pouted. 'I don't lose to old walls and silly wards, my

lord.'

'It would seem not.' The corner of the Dark Lord's mouth

curved up. 'Go and rest, Bella. No mask for you, you've made me no promises, after all.'

*So long as you're better than me, you get to make the rules.* Bella bounded away through the moonlight into the corridor, peering into the shadowed alcoves for an empty room. *But if he slips, if he loses, we'll go on playing without him, Bell.* She paused and stared into a marble-floored room with a broad bed and tall, dark cupboards. *Which will be a shame, it's fun to watch him win.*

'But whomever beats him will be fun to watch, too, Bell.' She smoothed down her dress and poked the duvet with her finger. 'Nope, I'm not sleepy.'

*We could go see Cissy and Andi, Bella.* Butterflies fluttered in her belly. She pinned them down with deep breaths, picturing getting them one at a time. *But we ought to tidy ourselves up, first. Andi will tease me if she sees me all mucky like this.*

Bella pulled her wand out and stripped the dirt from her skin and hair with a flick. A second charm restored the white to her teeth. 'I'm a -- I'm a -- I'm a... weird sister. I'm a -- I'm a -- I'm a... weird sister.' She conjured a small mirror and smiled at her dark hair's restored lustre, then waved her wand again, shearing her curls off at her shoulder blades. Faint crow's feet lined her eyes. 'I'm a -- I'm a -- I'm a... weird sister.'

*That'll do.* She paused, wand halfway back to her waist.

*Boots, Bella. We need boots, can't go about barefoot. We might slip.* A balustrade drifted away just beyond the reach of small fingers in the eye of her mind. *And fall, Bell. We might fall.* The fog of memory closed back over the balustrade with Cissy's scream. *Forget that, Bella.*

She transfigured an ornate vase into knee-high leather boots and slid her feet into them. 'It's a perfect fit, Bell!' Bella giggled and stuffed her wand back through her dress' girdle. 'Let's go see Cissy!'

She pictured the polished wood beams of Cissy's bedroom, the delicate silver sculptures of flowers upon the shelves, and the huge bed with its mountain of pillows. Her magic wrenched her away.

Bella twirled across the polished wood. 'Huh, it looks just the same, Bell!'

'Bellatrix...' Cissy stared at her with wide eyes from the door.

'You look almost the same.'

She cocked her head. 'No we don't, this is a new dress. The Dark Lord gifted it to us.'

Cissy swept forward, shutting the door behind her and

casting a quick ward. 'Why're you here, Bellatrix?'

A faint heat trickled through Bella's veins. 'Bella. We're *Bella.'* She huffed and stamped her foot. 'We wanted to see our sister. We wanted to play together. It's been *ages!*'

Cissy pinched the bridge of her nose and sidled another step forward. Beneath the faint shimmer of fading charms, dark bags hung under her eyes and deep lines marred her brow. 'I don't want to be involved in any of that, Bella. And I don't want Draco caught up in it either. It's not worth it.'

*Pretty little Cissy's a beautiful butterfly in a gilded silver cage, Bella.* A sadness welled up from the pit of her stomach; it melted into faint, liquid heat beneath her ribs. *She's grown all old and boring, Bell. She used to be so happy and bright and fun. We'll have to make her fun again.*

Bella pouted. 'Fine. We'll go find Andi. Andi *always* plays

with us.'

Cissy stared at her with big, blue eyes. 'Andi's gone, Bella.'

Her slim, small nose wrinkled. 'She ran off with some muggleborn,

remember? Mother and father were very upset. *Very.*'

Bella clawed through fogged thoughts but found nothing.

Heat bubbled through her blood. 'A mudblood!' She balled her fingers into fists. 'But they're so *boring!* They can't do anything, they're just sticks and clay, no bright lights or pretty colours, just bleating lumps of blood and flesh.'

'Well she did.' Cissy's limp trembled. 'And she didn't want to see either of us again.'

Bella forced the heat down. 'She's being silly. I'll find her and get her to come back and be with us. We're her *sisters.* She's meant to be here, not wasting time on some useless mudblood. What could it even do? They know nothing about anything and they're helpless as tadpoles in a dried puddle.'

Cissy sighed. 'I suppose if I told you not to, you'd just ignore

me.'

Bella giggled. 'Of course, itty bitty baby Cissy. Andi's got to

come back to us.' Her fingers crept to her wand, trembling with the heat coursing through her blood. The soft glow of her violet eyes grew bright, glinting off Cissy's silver sculptures. 'I'll just get rid of the stupid mudblood, then Andi *has* to come back and play with us.'

# Gone with the Rain

The last of leaves of the willow tree drifted from its branches across the river into the long grass and the fading autumn sun's weak warmth dappled across Fleur\'s face. She lay her head back in Harry\'s lap and closed her eyes, letting the faint heat soak into her cheeks. He cradled her head against him with one arm and ran his fingers through her hair.

*Perfect.* A small smile graced her lips. *As always.*

The warmth faded from her face. A spot of wet struck her cheek and trickled down to her jaw. Fleur opened her eyes. Dark, blue-grey clouds crept over the sun.

Harry brushed the droplet of her cheek with the tip of his finger and kissed her on the temple. \'We should head back to the chateau. It\'s going to rain.'

Fleur uncurled from his lap. 'Gabby's waiting to ambush

us...'

Harry laughed. \'Are you going to apparate me? Or do I have

to walk in the rain?\'

\'If my parents were around you'd be offering to walk,\' Fleur

replied.

'I suppose it's easier for you.' A touch of ice crept into the

green of Harry's eyes as he put his glasses back on. 'There's nobody else close to me you need to worry about.'

*Just Katie Bell.* Guilt lanced through Fleur's stomach. *But*

*he's right. Maman and Papa are being deliberately difficult. I've set*

*fire to enough copies of the Daily Prophet to warm the whole chateau for a month.*

\'I've nothing against your family,\' Harry murmured. 'I understand why.'

\'You get on with Gabby well.\' Fleur leant against his shoulder and smiled. \'But you *did* bribe her with Clafoutis, so I\'m not sure it counts.\'

\'It wasn\'t a bribe. It was a deal. I gave her the Clafoutis and she would stop pestering us about being romantic.\'

\'Well, it\'s worked so far.' Fleur held her hand out and watched the first spots of rain dot her palm. 'Although you've only seen her for about five minutes since the clafoutis ran out.'

The rain came down in a fast-paced staccato, drowning out the sound of the river beside them.

\'Let\'s go.\' Fleur took Harry's hand and apparated them back

into the middle of a pile of Gabby's shoes in the entrance hall.

The soft snap of their arrival echoed through the chateau. \'Did you kiss in the rain?\' Gabby bounded down the stairs, a

stack of magazines and a newspaper in her hands.

Harry sighed. \'No...'

Gabby pouted. 'You're supposed to kiss Fleur in the rain. It's

your *raison d'etre*.'

\'It\'s ok.\' Fleur patted Harry on the shoulder. \'The deal lasted a lot longer than I expected.\'

'Five minutes is not a long time,\' Harry muttered.

\'Are you going back outside to kiss?\' Gabby danced down the last few steps. A mischievous glint appeared in her eyes. 'Can *I* come instead of Fleur?'

Fleur levelled her best glare at Gabby. \'I will hex you.\'

Gabby stuck her tongue out. \'I\'m bored, there\'s nothing to do except read and I\'ve been reading all morning. I even read that silly English paper.\' She shook the stack of magazines in the air.

Harry's brow creased. 'Not the best read, that.'

\'I\'ve read it,\' Fleur said. \'There\'s nothing about you, for once.\' \'Just a big article about an escape from Azkaban,\' Gabby

added.

Harry extended a hand. 'May I?'

Gabby tugged the Daily Prophet out from the stack of

magazines and put the rest of the stack down on the stairs. 'Keep it if you want. It's rubbish.'

Harry skimmed the front page with cold eyes and flicked

through a few more pages. 'What nonsense.'

\'Is any of it true?\' Fleur stepped to his shoulder and craned

her neck.

\'Some of it.' Harry took a deep breath and closed the paper.

\'I've no doubt that these prisoners have escaped, but it wasn\'t Sirius Black that helped them.\'

\'I thought Black was a Death Eater too?\' Gabby asked.

\'He wasn\'t.\' Harry folded the paper up, then handed it back to Gabby. \'Do you want to help me practise hex deflection, Fleur?\'

*time.*

*Oh? He's changed his mind about duelling practice. About*

'Of course, monCœur.' Fleur tossed her hair back over her

shoulder and pointed downstairs toward the cellar.

Gabby closed her eyes, then bright blue flames sprang up on her palms and the paper burst to ashes. \'Can I help?\'

\'Only if Fleur agrees and you promise not to ask any more questions about kissing in the rain,\' Harry said.

Gabby turned to Fleur and put on her best pout and big

eyes. \'Please, Fleur?'

You can help, little chick.' Fleur smirked. 'We\'re going to be

hexing Harry until he learns to block and deflect spells.\'

Gabby grinned. 'Sounds fun.'

A faint hissing echoed from the kitchen. \'My hot chocolate!\' She scampered off.

'No promises for you, Harry,' Fleur whispered in his ear. 'You underestimate Gabby's deviousness.'

Harry chuckled. 'I suppose I can try more bribery.'

Fleur rolled her eyes. 'Don't. If you keep buying her sweets, she might actually try and steal you for herself. I'm *not* one for sharing.'

Mirth glowed in Harry's green eyes. 'No, you really *aren't*, are you? But it's not going to happen, I'm not sure I can even afford to just buy sweets for *you*. You go through sugar like a basilisk through schoolchildren.'

Fleur's heart squirmed. \'Come on, monCœur. \' She gave him a gentle push in the direction of the basement and grabbed his hand. \'You can tell me about Sirius Black on the way while Gabby is distracted.\'

Harry let her lead him away, chuckling under his breath.

She paused on the stairs. 'Well?'

\'Sirius is my godfather. None of what they say about him is true. He never betrayed my parents and he certainly didn\'t help anyone escape from Azkaban.\'

Fleur pursed her lips. \'So what really happened?'

Harry quirked an eyebrow at her. \'Voldemort broke them

out...'

\'I meant at Godric\'s Hollow, idiot.\'

Harry grinned. \'Ah, that makes more sense.\' The humour

wilted from his face. \'Sirius was supposed to be the secret keeper for the Fidelius Charm, but it was decided that he was too obvious, so they switched to Peter Pettigrew at the last moment. The rat was the traitor. He faked his death and Sirius ended up in Azkaban.\'

'He's still alive? He better hope we never get our hands on

him.\'

The corner of Harry's mouth twitched. 'He's dead.'

*Good.* Fleur's gaze traced the small curve of Harry's lips and

a faint suspicion crept in amongst her thoughts. *Did you do it, monCœur?* She tried to picture him over a body, wand outstretched. The image formed with ease. Harry's cold green eyes and dark wand

above the shadow of a corpse. *He could well have.* She turned her nose up. *And so what. Pettigrew deserved it.*

Gabby's footsteps pattered toward them.

*I will ask him.* Fleur buried a small twist of fear. *As long as he tells me the truth, I'll be fine. Nobody cares what happens to one murderer, but he must trust me how I trust him.*

She pulled Harry on toward the room at the far end of the

basement. 'Ready?'

Gabby darted through the door and set her hot chocolate down on the floor by the wall. White foam and chocolate trickled down the sides of the mug. \'Did I miss anything?\'

Fleur pulled her wand out and vanished the mess. \'We haven\'t even started. I was just about to explain to Harry what he\'s trying to do.\'

\'I read a bit about it at the start of last year,\' Harry said. \'Gabby will be learning about it soon anyway.\' Fleur

shrugged. \'Beauxbatons has duelling as an extra-curricular. We may

as well start with the basics for her sake.\'

Harry smirked. \'You just want to play teacher.'

Heat crept onto Fleur's cheeks. *So what if I like explaining things to someone I know wants to listen?*

Gabby giggled. \'Go on, Professor Fleur.'

Fleur tutted. \'Hush, class, or it will be detention.\'

\'I don\'t think Harry will mind getting detention with his Professor,\' Gabby snickered.

'Too right.' Harry's gaze dipped from her face and flicked back up. A touch of desire gleamed in his eyes. 'Every school boy's fantasy is the hot, foreign teacher. Would be a shame to waste the chance...'

Fleur flushed and raised her wand at the pair of them.

Gabby pressed both hands across her mouth to stifle her laughter. Harry grinned and let his wand slide out of his sleeve.

\'Deflecting hexes is based on the effect created by two colliding curses,\' Fleur said as the warmth faded from her cheeks. \'If two spells meet in the air, then they can ricochet off one another or just stop dead. You\'re trying to achieve a more controlled effect by projecting your magic through your wand to deflect spells away.\'

\'So it\'s like conjuring a mirror to reflect spells,\' Gabby said.

'Gabby got it first,\' Fleur jibed.

\'I already knew that,\' Harry muttered. \'And even if she did, so what? We\'re basically the same age.\'

Fleur stepped back. \'Then you\'ll be able to deflect this.

Expelliarmus.\'

Red light flashed from her wand. Harry side-stepped and

made a show of pretending he'd never seen it. Gabby giggled.

Fleur huffed and turned her nose up at him. 'You're a terrible student.' A smirk curved her lips. 'Terrible students don't get rewarded by their hot, foreign teacher, monCœur.'

Harry laughed and raised his wand. \'I\'ll deflect them.\'

Gabby eyed the slender piece of ebony. Her fingers curled into the folds of her black dress and she bounced on the balls of her feet.

*for you.*

*Tempted to listen to it, Gabby? I wonder what it'd feel like*

'Move a bit further away, Gabby. You don\'t want to be hit by

the deflected curse.\' Fleur threw a Stinging Hex at Harry.

Harry yawned and flicked his wand in the direction of the approaching curse.

She sighed. *Well, that's going to hurt a bit, monCœur.*

*Maybe I should've used something else.*

The Stinging Hex flashed back past her head and fizzled away against the wall.

Fleur smoothed her hair back down and narrowed her eyes

at Harry. \'You've done this before,\' she growled.

\'I haven\'t.\' He raised his palms. \'I\'ve only seen it done.\'

A hint of a pout crept onto her lips. \'Did you intentionally direct it back at me?\'

\'Maybe...\' Laughter danced in his emerald eyes.

Fleur's heart lurched and she swallowed a sudden rush of

emotion. *He's so perfect.*

Gabby giggled and pulled her wand out of her dress' cleavage. 'Can I help?'

\'Of course, little chick.\' Fleur shot the front of her dress a long look and Gabby turned a little pink. \'Just very light Stinging

Hexes, Gabby. I don't want to have to explain to Maman why we

accidentally killed Harry in the basement.\'

Gabby nodded, then her expression brightened. 'But... tragic romance?'

'I'm not a fan of sad endings,' Fleur replied. 'Who'd want to read one of those?'

Harry shifted his footing and balance, raising his wand. His green eyes sharpened and froze. Fleur's heart squirmed and wriggled under her ribs, and a strong desire to crush her lips against his swept through her.

*Later, monCœur.* Fire coursed through her blood. *And soon,*

*more than just kisses. You're mine.*

She cast her hex. Harry deflected it, sending it hissing off to one side. Gabby\'s struck him on the hip.

'Ow.' He winced and rubbed at the skin under his robes. 'Stinging Hexes? Really?'

\'Not at the same time, Gabby,\' Fleur chided.

\'Sorry.' Gabby's broad grin ruined her apology. 'Sort of.'

\'You\'re pushing too much magic into it, Harry,\' Fleur said. \'You want it to be enough to redirect the hex, not to try and hammer it away from you.\'

\'Again?\' Gabby beamed and raised her wand.

\'Does she get to practise this as well?\' Harry shot Gabby a

flat look. 'I can do better than Stinging Hexes...'

\'Not until she\'s older,\' Fleur said. \'Hex him, Gabby.\'

'We're the same bloody age,' Harry muttered.

He deflected the Stinging Hexes Gabby hurled at him with less and less force until it seemed he was flicking them away off the tip off his wand. Fleur cast a few of her own into the mix, but he kept going, even when she left him only a second or two to react.

Something smashed by the door.

*Merde.* Fleur twisted round, releasing a long sigh when she saw the door was shut. *Not a bottle.*

Gabby let out a small squeak of despair. \'My hot chocolate...'

A small, steaming pool of foam and chocolate spread across the floor. Fleur repaired the mug with a wave of her wand and vanished the mess.

\'You spilt my hot chocolate. You owe me.\' Gabby turned the full force of her pleading look on Harry.

Harry grinned. \'It doesn\'t work for her now, either. I can ignore it.\'

Fleur narrowed her eyes. Liquid heat pooled in her bones and feathers prickled along her arms and down her spine. *I warned you, Gabby.*

Gabby threw a nervous look at Fleur. \'I\'m not using my magic. I promise, Fleur.\'

*She'd better not have.* Fleur shot Gabby a serious look and felt a swoop of relief when she nodded. *If you repeatedly use that aspect of your magic on someone, it can leave a permanent mental association. I don't need Harry stuck with a lingering desire for my little sister.* She wrinkled her nose. *Urgh. That'd be awful.*

you.\'

Harry's eyebrows shot up. \'You mean that\'s *natural?\'*

Gabby\'s lower lip quivered.

Harry slipped his wand away and sighed. \'Alright. I owe

\'Can I touch your wand?\' Gabby stuck out her hand. Harry cracked a wide grin. \'I don\'t think your sister would

approve.'

Gabby spluttered, red-faced. Fleur wrestled her own flush

back.

\'Revenge is sweet,\' Harry said. \'You can. Don\'t try to cast

anything with it, though, my friend got burnt when he tried. It\'s very closely bonded to me.\'

Gabby took the ebony wand from his hands, holding it between her forefinger and thumb. \'It\'s *cold*.... like I\'m gripping an icicle.\' She frowned. \'I don\'t think it likes me holding it. Do you mind if I *listen* to it?\'

Harry's brow wrinkled. 'I'm not sure what you mean, Gabby.'

\'You remember I told you that we can feel magic to a certain extent?\' Fleur waited for him to nod. 'I'm fine with things enchanted to last and powerful or emotive magic, but Gabby's a lot better than me, she---'

\'Let *me* explain, Fleur.\' Gabby pouted. \'You always make it sound so strange.\'

\'It *is* strange, little chick.\'

\'I can get a really good idea of the feelings or intent of magic when I listen to it,\' she chirped. \'Like you would if you studied an enchantment. Fleur only gets a fraction of what I do.\' Gabby stuck her chin in the air.

\'What do you feel from a wand?\' Harry asked.

\'Wands hold the echo of any magic cast through them, so if I really focus, I can get a kind of impression of what your magic's like, or at least, your overall intent.\' She shuffled her feet. \'It\'s quite a personal thing, but you\'re Fleur\'s now, and Maman said I can listen to anyone\'s wand if they\'re part of the family.\'

A faint, soft smile flickered across Harry\'s lips. \'Listen away.

I\'m curious to hear what you feel.\'

Gabby took his wand in both her hands and pressed it against her chest, scrunching her eyes shut. \'It\'s so *alive,*\' she whispered.

*That's not how you've described anyone else's.* Fleur frowned. *She said mymagic felt like running her fingertips across warm silk, or hot rose petals. Soft, but strong.*

\'It\'s like holding my hand in the river in winter. The current's strong and it\'s ice cold. I can almost hear the water whispering.\' A wide, dazed smile spread across Gabby's face and she screwed her eyes shut tighter. \'I\'m sure if I could just listen a little harder, I'd be able to hear what it\'s saying.\'

Harry pried his wand from her grasp. \'I think that\'s enough.'

Gabby scowled, stuffing pale, purple-nailed fingers into her armpits. 'But I want to listen to the whispers.'

\'Don\'t try stealing it later.' Fleur let a hint of stone creep into her voice. \'Harry\'s wand is quite unique; it has a liquid core and seems to be *very* closely bonded to him. It was reluctant to respond to you when you were pouring your magic over it to *listen* when he gave you permission. Don\'t try it later.\'

\'It burnt Neville when he tried to use it even after I gave him permission.' Harry replaced his wand up his sleeve. \'It wasn\'t particularly painful, but it looked quite uncomfortable.\'

Gabby sulked. \'I wasn\'t going to.\' Fleur shot her a sharp look.

'Okay, okay.' Gabby giggled. 'I really won't.'

\'Getting back to why we actually came down here,\' Fleur said. \'Harry\'s got the idea. It won\'t be as easy deflecting different spells at different speeds and still be able to control where they go, and you could probably do with working on your reflexes to make sure you\'re as fast as you can be, but that's the gist.\'

\'Has the lesson ended? Are we free to leave, Professor Fleur?\' Gabby chirped.

\'Shoo, Gabby.\' Fleur watched her snatch her mug and scamper off.

*To make another hot chocolate and twice as much mess, probably.*

Harry stepped to her side, a thoughtful expression on his face. \'Your mother runs a potions shop, doesn\'t she?\'

\'Yes.' Fleur sidled into his embrace. \'Why?\'

\'Did you mean what you said about not caring what I did?\' he murmured.

A tight knot pulled itself taut in her stomach. Fleur slipped her arm round Harry and pulled him close. \'As long as you\'re *mine*,\' she whispered.

'All yours.' He pressed his lips to her forehead. 'Always.' 'Do you trust me?' Fleur wriggled under his arm and leant

her head into the crook of his neck. 'I don't mean with little stuff, or

normal stuff, with *everything*.'

Harry stared down at her, a strange gleam in his eye. 'Of course. Why're you asking, Fleur?'

'I want you to tell me things.' She pursed her lips. 'I want you to *want* to tell me things. Everything. No matter what it is.' Her voice shook and she huffed. 'I -- I don't share myself readily, you *know* that. But I've shared everything I am with you. I want to. And I want to know that *you* do, too.'

A small little smile crept onto Harry's lips. 'I do. I very much do.' He grimaced. 'I've not told you everything, I know. Sometimes... sometimes I still fear that I'll disappoint you and you'll disappear\...'

*Like all the other things you wished for?*

'I won't.' Fleur kissed the side of his neck and the small knot of unease loosened a little in her belly. 'I'll prove it. What happened to Peter Pettigrew?'

Harry tensed. 'He died... *badly.*'

'You killed him,' Fleur murmured. 'I wondered, when you said before, and I think I knew, even then.'

A thick silence crept over them.

*He killed someone. Murdered them.* Fleur picked through her feelings, seeking some disgust, dislike, fear, or fury. Apprehension crept in only with the idea of aurors. *So long as he's not caught and taken away from me, it doesn't matter. And if they try, he can just come here.*

'I don't care,' she said. 'I don't. What does Peter Pettigrew mean to me? He deserved it. Just don't get caught. I would miss you if they stuck you in Azkaban.'

'I didn't just do it because of that,' Harry whispered. 'It was... It was necessary.'

'I don't care. You're not their hero,' Fleur said. 'You're *mine*.

And I don't want a silly, shallow hero's caricature, I couldn't love anyone like that. I want someone like *me*.' She curled her fingers into his robes. 'Besides. Heroes *die*.'

'I won't die.' Harry's grip tightened. 'Nothing's going to steal you away from me. Nothing and nobody. Perfect wishes don't come true often, so I'm not losing mine. I'll pay whatever price I must to keep you with me.'

Warmth flooded through Fleur's chest and swirled in a thick ball in her throat; hot tears prickled at her eyes. 'Now you sound like you've been reading Gabby's favourite books. Have the two of you been sneaking off together?'

He let out a quiet chuckle and gave her fingers a squeeze. 'I

think maybe they were your favourites too, once.'

*He knows me.*

Fleur pressed her face into his neck, but her tears trickled free from her lashes, tracing little hot lines down her cheeks. 'A long time ago, maybe they might've been.'

Harry drew back a fraction and wiped her tears away with the ball of his thumb. 'Fleur?'

'Désolée,' she murmured. 'It just -- it means a lot.'

'Je connais, ma princesse.' Harry bent and pressed a soft kiss to her cheek. 'I know.'

Fleur smiled at him and swiped her tears away on her

sleeve. 'So why do you need potions ingredients, monCœur?'

\'I know a way to improve my reflexes and my eyesight, but I need a few things that I don\'t know how to get hold of.\'

\'What do you need?\' Fleur asked. 'Potions like that don't last

long.'

claw.'

\'Wormwood, bayberry, salamander\'s blood and a griffon

'An odd combination.' Fleur frowned. \'Is it some kind of

strengthening potion? Wormwood and bayberry are used in potions to repair macula and retina damage for short periods of time in subjects with degenerative eye diseases.\'

\'Not exactly.\' Harry\'s lips twisted. \'I need the effect to be permanent, so I'm dabbling in some magic most people would balk at and the Ministry might be tempted to send me somewhere unpleasant for.\'

She turned her nose up at him. 'I already told you I don't

care. And I *don't* like repeating myself.'

Harry's lips curved into a small smile. \'A ritual, using blood

magic. I need to fix my eyesight and any edge I can seize, I ought to.\'

\'That sounds *dark*,\' Fleur teased. 'What would the English

papers say about their hero doing magic like that?'

\'Right now, they'd probably be overjoyed,' Harry muttered. 'There\'s no such thing as dark or light magic, anyway. Just the intent with which your power's directed.\'

She smiled. 'Just like enchanting. Intent-laced magic can be used to heal or cause harm.' Fleur frowned. 'Just be careful, magic like that rarely fulfils the expectations of those that cast. I don't want to lose you because your glasses get lost in a duel, but if the price of fixing your eyesight is to lose you for certain...'

'I'm reliably informed I am one of the few witches or wizards with the capability to perform magic of this nature.\' A touch of colour rose on his cheeks. 'Apparently, it requires no small amount of power, both magical and willpower.'

She nodded, then smirked. \'Does this mean you\'ll stop wearing your glasses?\'

\'I won\'t need them if it works.'

'Good.' Fleur settled herself into his arms. 'I like your eyes and those glasses are tasteless.'

*I wonder if he can use this sort of magic to help me enchant things. Would we able to create something amazing?*

'Can we use this sort of magic for enchanting?' Fleur asked. 'I've always dreamt of creating something truly spectacular.

Something beyond my little projects or what every day witches and

wizards can manage.'

\'The sacrifice has to be proportional. You don't get something for nothing. It\'s going to cost me a lot of magic, a lot of blood, pain, and more to fix my eyes and give myself a small edge.' He shot her half a smile and pulled her close. 'I don't think I'd be willing to pay the price for something like you're talking about.'

Fleur relaxed into his arms. The gentle throb of his heart reverberated through her chest, beating in time with hers. \'You better not make any mistakes. I will set fire to you if you do.'

He grinned down at her. \'I won\'t. I promise.\'

\'I\'ll apparate to Carcassonne before you leave and get the ingredients for you,\' Fleur decided. \'You\'ll have to pay, though.\'

\'It's best if they're whole,\' Harry said. \'The more they look like what they are, the easier it is to hold the associations in mind when I weave the intent of the ritual.\'

'Maybe about six hundred galleons all in.' Fleur shot him a rueful smile. 'Sorry. Griffon's claw's *really* expensive, especially whole.'

Mirth sparkled in Harry's eyes. \'It's okay. I have some galleons. You see, I won this really prestigious tournament a short while back---'

'Only because someone interfered.' Fleur leant back out of

his arms and fixed him with a playful scowl.

He chuckled.

*Not going to kiss me?* A faint pout curved her lips.

Harry bent down and pressed his lips to hers. 'You're very cute when you do that,' he murmured.

Fleur slipped his fingers into her hair and pushed him away. 'I'm *always* cute.' She laughed. \'Was there anything else you wanted me to help with? Duelling, rare ingredients for your dark rituals, I\'m not sure what else I can offer to the budding Dark Lord Potter.\'

*Other than me.* Faint heat traced through her veins, the shadow of his hands on her lingered amongst her thoughts, and her breath caught. *But you can have me the moment you're ready, monCœur.*

Harry glanced up at the cellar roof. \'Do you know a way to conceal something so it only reveals with a certain phrase?\'

\'What're you trying to conceal?\' Fleur smothered her thoughts before the heat crept onto her face. 'There're lots of ways to do it.'

\'A map, hand drawn.\' A little ice crept back into his green eyes. 'Dumbledore is a nuisance, constantly keeping track of me and stopping me from finding out things I *need* to know to survive. But if I manage to oust him from the school, Umbridge will have the run of the place, and that can't be allowed to last long. She's awful.'

Fleur shrugged. 'I'll show you.'

They drifted back up the stairs. Her arm remained round his waist, his arm around her shoulders, bumping hips on every step.

*Where's the boy who flinched from just the idea of touching*

*me?* Fleur smiled to herself. *I have been good for him, I think.*

She led them through to the kitchen and stole part of Gabby's essay. 'Watch.' Fleur borrowed Gabby's quill and poured a little ink into the lid of the inkpot. 'You enchant the ink with the concealing charms, making sure it's strong enough to resist revealing charms and anything someone might use to try and reveal it.'

Fleur drew a circle of dark ink on the white parchment and pulled out her wand, threading her intent for it to be concealed into the magic she pushed into the ink. The circle faded from sight.

\'Oh my, it\'s disappeared!' Harry covered his mouth with his

hands in feigned shock.

\'Do you want me to show you?\' Fleur demanded.

\'Sorry.' Harry's wide grin didn't convince her. She huffed. 'That doesn't sound very genuine.'

He leant into her ear. 'I only tease you because I love you,'

he murmured.

Fleur's heart squirmed. *He's never actually said that before.*

She swallowed down another searing hot rush of emotion.

'I love you, too,' she whispered back.

Gabby squealed.

'Hush, little chick,' Fleur said. 'Not. A. Word.' Gabby beamed. 'I won't. It'd ruin it.'

Fleur levelled a suspicious look at her.

'But I might mention it later.' Gabby's eyes gleamed with mischief. 'Maman might hear.'

'I will toast you, Gabby.' Fleur turned back to Harry and her piece of parchment. 'You can then enchant the parchment to reveal anything upon it when a certain phrase is said. If you make that piece of magic strong enough, it'll overcome the concealment charms on the ink.\'

\'That\'s it?\' Harry asked. 'Really?'

\'Vraiment.' Fleur smirked. \'I\'d suggest a few extra enchantments to stop anyone destroying the parchment or ink, but that's easier than trying to imbue it with magic with opposing intent in different situations. Save that for when you're as good as me.\'

'So modest.' Harry leant forward and kissed her, flicking the

tip of his tongue against Fleur\'s upper lip.

A pleasant tingle rippled down Fleur's spine. She closed her

eyes and let him take hold of her waist and pull her into his arms.

Gabby giggled. 'Do I get a turn, Harry? Fleur seems to be really enjoying it.'

Fleur opened her eyes and leant around Harry. 'Over your charred body do you get a turn, baby sister.'

Harry laughed. 'I don't think Fleur's keen on sharing.' He shrugged. 'Which is good, because I don't think I'm very keen on sharing her, either.'

'So not fair.' Gabby pouted. 'You would've made such a good boyfriend.' She turned to Fleur and wagged her finger. 'If you weren't preying on younger boys, I would've been able to have him all for myself, you perverted harpy.'

Fleur laughed. 'Sorry, Gabby. I promise if I ever get tired of

him, you can have him.'

'Thanks,' Harry murmured. 'I feel so loved, like a childhood toy being given from sister to sister.' A quiet chime echoed through the kitchen and Harry's humour faded. 'I have to go back, Fleur.'

*Not ready to stay with me all night just yet.* She stifled a flare of frustration. *But he is a little younger.*

'I know.' Fleur curled her fingers into her robes and hauled him close for one last kiss. 'But one day you will stay, yes?'

He smiled. 'Yes.' 'Soon?'

'Soon. I promise.' Harry vanished with a soft snap.

Cold kitchen air crept through Fleur's clothes where he'd been. She stared down at the parchment she'd made, glanced at the bin, then folded it up and tucked it through the strap of her bra.

Gabby pulled her quill and inkpot back across the table. 'He's perfect. Really. You do spend all your time with him instead of me now, but he's perfect. I've not seen you smile so much in years.'

Fleur wrinkled her nose. 'Don't tell me that. Tell Maman and

Papa.'

Gabby sighed and muttered something that would've earnt

her a sharp scolding if either Maman or Papa had been there to hear it. 'Just don't listen to them, Fleur. They'll realise they're wrong.' A glimmer of mischief welled up in her eyes. 'Want to enchant Maman's slippers to tickle her feet?'

Fleur laughed. 'And get left blamed at the end when you deny all knowledge and bat your eyelashes at Papa? Okay, little chick.'

# Cartography

Harry stared into the dark, cold water beneath the forked-

tongue bridge. 'Might as well do it now.'

\'You want to do it now?\' Salazar peered at him from where his portrait leant against one of the serpent figurines. \'It\'s the morning.\'

'Does that make a difference to the magic?' Harry's tone came out dry as dust. 'Am I going to get a *please leave a message, your magic ritual will get back to you later?*'

'Obviously not.' Salazar crossed his arms. 'I thought you might actually have something to do later in the day. I forgot you sulk and skip all your lessons and detentions, troubled, edgy teen that you are.'

Harry chuckled. 'I go to the ones with Snape. Otherwise Dumbledore might do something even more annoying. No point doing the rest. What're they going to do, write home to Vernon and Petunia?' He grinned. 'I'd *love* to see that*.*'

Salazar's green eyes softened. 'You've more important

things to do, it's true. Very well. Let's get started.'

Harry slid his wand from his sleeve and summoned his small stash of ingredients out from Salazar's study. 'How long will it take?\'

'Not long, depending on how quickly you manage to get the patterns of the ritual perfectly right.\'

\'Just enough time before lunch.\' Harry grinned, a knot of apprehension tangling itself into a ball of excitement somewhere down in his gut. 'Excellent.'

\'You\'ll be tired for the rest of the day,\' Salazar said. \'And I don\'t mean the occasional yawn. You\'ll *feel* it.\'

\'I\'ve only really got one piece of magic I need to perform later today. The DA's meeting and I need to enchant a piece of paper.\' Harry shrugged. \'I\'ll venture to the hospital wing for a potion or two to keep me on my feet. Madam Pomfrey will patch me up. She always does.\' Harry pulled out the book on rituals. '\'What do I want? I\'m assuming something in patterns of seven, it is the magically strongest number.\'

\'Three concentric seven-pointed stars,\' Salazar said. \'Make them large enough for you to stand in and make sure you get all the runes right. You need to change a few bits from the one in the book to get the balance right.\'

'That's going to be a lot of blood,' Harry murmured.

\'Yes. And you\'ll have to do it quickly. The ritual needs the blood to be fresh; its effect fades once it has begun to congeal.\'

'I\'ll prepare the wormwood and bayberry first, then.\' Harry paused. 'What do I have to do? Just split them up?'

'Keep the two types separate and make sure they're easily recognisable as wormwood and bayberry leaves.\' Salazar pointed at the two jars of leaves with his wand. 'It helps with the intent if the mental association's right at the forefront of your mind. Put bayberry at four points of each star and wormwood at the other three. Make sure they're on the same points for all the stars.'

\'So I just have to draw it all.\' Harry arranged the leaves with a flick of his wand. 'For something that's going to have quite a lot of benefit and will be permanent, I don't really feel I'm sacrificing that much. If it just hurts and costs blood, why doesn't everyone do it?'

Salazar's eyes darkened. 'You've sacrificed more than that, Harry, though it helps. Remember how once you were so adamant to be the noble hero and not emulate Tom at all?'

Harry grimaced. 'I do.'

'Did it hurt to learn otherwise?' Harry's lips twisted. 'Yes.'

'And here you are.' Salazar sighed. 'Still think you've not sacrificed enough?'

'I suppose I've sacrificed quite a lot.' Harry spun his wand round upon his palm. 'Strange. Would it've worked if you'd not told me?'

'Maybe not quite as well, but well enough.' A small, proud smile appeared on Salazar's face. 'You're aware how much you've given up compared to others just to survive. And you're determined to survive. Everything you do has that intent behind it, it will serve you well in every ritual you undergo, for they all share the same ultimate goal and the same great sacrifice. That's why ordinary wizards and witches cannot do this sort of magic, Harry. It's rare for anyone to be forced to give up so much and still have sufficient drive to carry on.'

*He's proud of me.* A fist of emotion clenched itself tight beneath Harry's ribs. *And it's really of me, not some false perception of a hero or anything like that.*

He studied the leaves by his feet. 'I guess I should draw everything.'

'Be careful, Harry,' Salazar murmured. 'Especially when you come to make your own changes. The runes will carry slightly different associations to you than they do for me. My corrections can no longer help you, the complexity of the intent has passed beyond that point.'

Harry raised his wand and sketched runes of purple flame into the floor, forming the three concentric, seven-pointed stars. He glanced back and forth between the book and the pattern, tweaking the occasional cluster of runes.

\'That\'s as close to perfect as you\'ll be able to make it,' Salazar said. 'Now you just need to go over the stars with blood and take the plunge.\'

*He makes it sound so simple.* Harry's stomach churned and his heart picked up its beat, hammering against his ribs. *Take the plunge. We can't look back. We can't lose Fleur.* He took a deep breath and bared his wrist, pressing the tip of his wand into his skin.

'Here we go,' he whispered.

Harry drew the tip of his wand across his wrist. His smooth, pale skin parted like water, stinging and burning like basilisk venom in his blood. Crimson welled up, trickling down his arm and swelling to a throbbing gush. Harry grit his teeth and raised his wand, drawing blood from his arm like a ribbon on a stick and tracing the purple runes from start to finish.

A web of magic hung from the tip of his wand, a woven net of intent, ready to be cast.

He mopped sweat off his forehead and raised his arm over his head to lessen the flow. \'I\'m ready.'

'Tie something around your arm just in case.' Salazar pointed his wand at Harry's face. \'And take off your glasses. You shouldn\'t be needing those again.\'

Harry conjured a thin piece of black rope and tied it tight round his left bicep. 'Will I pass out?' He pulled off his glasses and tossed them away.

\'Probably not.\' Salazar nodded, mimicked by his snake. 'It will hurt, though. The ritual will exact as much pain as you feel this is worth once everything else has been taken into account.\'

Harry released the web of magic and the runes pulsed, turning from deep indigo to bright violet. A vivid crimson light shone at its edges as his blood burst into steam, and the small piles of leaves hissed and exploded into clouds of thick, white smoke.

The smoke stung Harry's eyes and nose. He squeezed his eyes shut, holding his breath. A blinding white flash seared through his eyelids. The stinging in his eyes crawled deep, like a thousand tiny hooked needles caught within them and a cold tingle wrapped around his feet, creeping up his calves, his thighs, and up to his waist. His muscles numbed as if he stood in ice-cold water.

*This is awful.* Harry choked down a lungful of smoke as the cold, numb feeling seeped up his neck and into his face. *How long will this last?*

The burning in his eyes flared into searing flame. Bright white pierced through his eyelids like a lance. Harry pressed his fingertips into his temples and clenched his jaw. His magic drained away like water into dirt, leaving him hollow and gasping.

The fire in his eyes faded. Warmth crept back into his limbs.

*Is it done?* Harry opened his eyes.

Blackened, bloodied leaf ash surrounded him, and purple runes guttered out on the stones around his feet. The sharp scales of the serpents stretched up to the ceiling in every alcove, and the peeling gold leaf of the titles of the books on the shelves of Salazar's study glinted through the door.

Harry caught sight of his shattered glasses on the floor. *It worked.* He vanished the broken spectacles.

\'Did it work?\' Salazar asked.

Harry nodded. Dizziness seized his head and nausea bubbled up in his stomach. He lowered himself to the floor with a thud and took shallow breaths through his nose.

Salazar snickered. \'Regretting not doing it in the evening?\'

Harry let the sickness pass and dragged himself back to his feet. His stomach growled and gnawed at itself. 'I\'m really very hungry. If I could muster the energy to get to the Great Hall for lunch, I\'d say I timed it perfectly.\'

\'Go to the hospital wing before eating, get the cut on your arm healed, then get some energy back and try to do as little as possible for the rest of the day.\'

Harry slid his wand back into his sleeve. 'I still have to enchant that map.' He groaned. 'I might sleep for a week after I've done that.'

Salazar folded his arms. \'I'll allow you to leave me here for now, if you tried putting me back we\'d probably both end up in the pool.\'

Harry grimaced and vanished the remnants of his ritual, staggering away across the chamber. Each step back up to Myrtle's bathroom felt like a mountain and a deep, hollow ache burnt in his legs every time he forced himself a stride further.

The bathroom mirror held a pale, shivering, sweating figure with a blood-soaked left sleeve and a faint, eldritch gleam hovering in Harry's eyes.

*Perfect.* He rinsed his face in one of the few sinks that worked and dried it on his clean sleeve. *Madam Pomfrey can fix my arm and give me a few things to keep me going long enough to enchant the list. After that, I can sleep.*

Harry stumbled from the bathroom and through empty corridors, limbs shaking and burning. He staggered into the hospital wing, his injured arm tucked behind his back.

\'What have you done to yourself *now*, Mr Potter?\' Madam Pomfrey strode across, pulling her wand out.

\'I think I\'ve lost quite a bit of blood,\' he murmured, presenting his injured wrist.

She released a low hiss and ran her wand over him. 'How did this happen? You\'re *covered* in magic. I can barely tell what's going on there's so much!'

Harry shrugged.

Madam Pomfrey cut his tourniquet away and tossed it onto the end of the bed. The cut welled up, crimson swelling in from the

edges and trickling from the bottom of the cut down his arm to drip onto the white-tiled floor. She traced the line of the cut with her wand and it crept closed, the flesh knitting back together in the wake of her wand's glowing tip.

'Thanks,' Harry muttered.

\'This was created by magic, Mr Potter.\' Madam Pomfrey's face twisted into a stern frown. \'If you aren\'t going to tell me how this came about, then I can only assume the worst and deduce you have been duelling in the corridors somewhere!\'

*Not even close.*

Madam Pomfrey slipped her wand away and moved over to one of the cupboards. She rummaged through vials, dropping a collection of dark red ones down onto the bed beneath. \'You\'ll need all of those.\' She gathered the vials of dark red potion and grabbed two more. \'You\'ve lost almost a litre of blood. And these two, one for the pain and one to give you some energy back.\'

Harry lowered himself onto the end of the bed. The ache in his legs still gnawed at him, and a deep weight of exhaustion hung off him. 'Better than two litres.'

Madam Pomfrey jabbed a finger at the potions. \'Why aren\'t you drinking?\'

Harry gulped them down one after the other, grimacing at the bitter taste. 'I feel very liquidy now.' His stomach sloshed with every movement.

'If I tell you to stay here, will you actually do it, Mr Potter?\' Madam Pomfrey's expression softened.

Harry pretended to think about it and grinned. \'No.'

I didn\'t think so.\' Madam Pomfrey began tidying up. \'Honestly, it's like you have no sense of self preservation. Off you go, then. Make sure you *eat* something before lunch ends. You\'re excused from anything strenuous, magical or otherwise, until the end of the week, and I *will* be talking to your teachers to make sure that they know.\'

'Fair enough.'

*I've no magic I need to cast in class, anyway.* He swung himself off the bed, stomach sloshing, and stumbled onto his feet.

A faint dizziness struck him and the world spun.

His reflection stared back from the window with exhausted

eyes.

*Better than before, though. I look like I've been playing*

*quidditch for ten hours, not murdering first years.*

Harry straightened the collar of his robes and swept his hair to one side, limping from the hospital wing to slump onto a bench in the Great Hall beside Nev.

Cedric glanced up from the far side of the table. \'You look

terrible. Are you alright?'

\'I had a run in with Madam Pomfrey.\' Harry smiled and helped himself to as much food as was within reach.

Cedric watched Harry devour enough mashed potato to make a small mountain. \'Did she order you to eat?\'

Harry swallowed his mouthful. \'She might've done.'

Nev tugged his lunch out of Harry's reach. \'Have you heard about the most recent decree?\'

'Another one? What was it?'

\'There\'s some law about teachers not being able to discuss anything with students that isn\'t about their subject,\' Nev muttered. 'Absolutely stupid.'

\'It\'s because of the breakout from Azkaban.\' Cedric shook his head. \'My dad says there\'s no evidence Sirius Black's even in the country, but Fudge doesn\'t want anything to contradict the Ministry\'s version of events.\'

\'Does it apply to Umbridge?\' Harry asked. 'She might have to spend her lesson talking about the subject, if she knows any of it, instead of badmouthing anyone without seven generations of lineage in some fancy old book.'

Cedric laughed. 'You know your family's one of those families, right, Harry?'

\'I doubt Umbridge's got to stick to it.\' Nev's eyes glittered with anger. 'She'll keep spewing nonsense all lesson. You know, she's happier when you're not bothering to turn up, because every time you're there, you turn it round on her or just ignore her. You can't defend yourself when you're playing truant.'

\'A shame.'

\'We need to be going.\' Nev pointed up at the storm clouds gathering above them on the Great Hall's ceiling. \'You promised to come to this one, Harry.'

Harry shot a look at Cedric out of the corner of his eye. \'I\'m

coming.\'

\'I\'m coming too. Neville just asked me.' Cedric laughed. 'I think Neville wanted an assistant who\'d actually teach someone, but I\'ll wait for Harry to finish eating in case he collapses on the way up.\'

Nev swung himself out of the bench. \'You were right about the wand, by the way. It's not made a huge difference, but the trembling's stopped and I don\'t have to force myself quite so hard to get the same effects, so thanks. I\'m glad I listened.\' He held his hand up, displaying faint red marks on his palm in the size and shape of Harry's wand. \'Not so glad about these, though.'

\'There was something wrong with his wand?\' Cedric asked. \'He was using his father\'s wand,\' Harry replied. \'It wasn\'t the

best match he could have had.\'

\'Quite a lot of wizards and witches do that,\' Cedric said. 'Your own wand's always better, but if it works well enough some prefer to save the gold.'

\'So why're you coming to this little group?\' Harry forked sausage and potato into his mouth, chewed three times, then gulped it all down. 'Can't imagine you need to learn anything.'

\'I\'m not fond of Umbridge,\' Cedric said. \'She\'s destroying your chances of passing exams and getting good jobs later on. The Ministry's spouting nonsense, too. Everyone knows there\'s something wrong with the version of events they keep saying, but there's something I just can't quite put my thumb on.' He frowned and shook his head. \'Do you ever have that feeling you\'ve forgotten something important?\'

Harry dragged a bright smile onto his face. \'All the time.\'

*The memory charm's failing.* He swallowed a ball of cold rage. *Hermione's incessant digging for unnecessary detail is going to*

*make him remember. As if it matters what exactly happened.*

*Voldemort's to blame. We all know it already.*

\'I talked to Hermione Granger. She's not convinced by things either.\' Cedric frowned. '*Really* not convinced. That girl's borderline obsessed.'

\'I\'m not surprised. She gets like that about stuff.\'

\'I wanted to ask you about what happened,\' Cedric said. \'I remember you stunning me, but that\'s it.\'

Harry pushed his plate away, appetite lost. \'Did Hermione not tell you what I told her?\'

\'She did...\' Cedric's forehead creased. 'But I know you had a falling out with most of your housemates and I thought you might know a bit more.\'

*Should I tell him and soften the blow? Or do I keep myself well clear of the trouble and let Hermione drag it all up?* Harry wrestled with it as he pushed himself up. *There's not going to be that much trouble, I'll be fine.*

\'I know what happened, Cedric.\' He strode toward the door and up the stairs, skirting the trick step and pausing at a quiet corner. 'I can tell you, but before I do, let me say that you might rather I'd not.'

Cedric's face paled. \'I'd a feeling you'd say something like that,' he murmured. 'Sometimes, I get flashes, little fleeting feelings. I remember horror. And I remember guilt.\'

\'Bagman only cast one curse at any of us, the Imperius Curse, and he cast it at you.\'

Cedric reeled back. 'Then I -- I killed---'

'No.' Harry shook his head. 'You're not responsible for your actions and you had no warning or way to defend yourself.' He sighed. 'I was hoping you'd not remember. I obliviated you to undo the Imperius Curse, I hoped it wouldn\'t work if you didn\'t recall anything, then I stunned you and snapped your wand so nobody would be able to pin things on you.\'

'Thank you,' Cedric croaked. \'I owe you a debt I can\'t repay. If you hadn\'t done that, I might be in Azkaban; my parents would've been heartbroken and I'd be worse than dead.\'

\'Best not to tell Hermione,\' Harry suggested. \'If you\'re still acting like you don\'t remember, then nobody attracts any suspicion. I\'m not going to get in trouble for what I did.\'

*Hermione doesn't deserve to know. She probably hasn't even considered anything but her own need to know exactly what happened.*

They climbed the stairs in a tense, thick silence. Cedric's clenched fists bounced against his thighs as he stumbled up the steps staring ahead like a blind man into the sun.

*He'll be fine. He's a good person and strong-minded.*

A group of about twenty five students gathered around Nev by the troll tapestry. Harry recognised the faces of most who\'d come to the meeting in the Hog\'s Head. Hermione shouldered her way through the group and dragged Cedric to one side, waving the list and a quill at him. Nev paced the corridor.

An unspectacular wooden door flowed from the stone to excited whispers and Nev ushered everyone inside.

Hermione waved her list at everyone until they drew back against one side of the room. \'Welcome to the first session of Dumbledore\'s Army. I\'m glad that everybody came, even though this group is now technically illicit courtesy of Umbridge.\'

A few small smiles appeared.

\'What is this place?\' Katie appeared beside Harry. Her tie hung askew from her collar, and ink spots spattered the front of her shirt from the two undone buttons of her cleavage to where the shadow of her bra curved round her side.

\'The Room of Requirement,\' Harry murmured. \'It\'s quite

handy.\'

*Not that anyone here but me knows more than a couple of*

*its secrets.*

Katie straightened her tie and tugged at her uniform, running a finger over her eyebrows and sweeping her hair back behind her ears. \'It\'s awesome.' She took hold of his wrist and tugged. \'I think Neville\'s going to make a speech.\'

\'This should be good.\' Harry grinned. \'He\'s still quite shy around people he doesn\'t know well. It\'s a bit strange actually, he\'s worse with them than he is with complete strangers.\'

\'So...\' Nev pulled a piece of parchment from his pocket and scanned it. \'L-like Hermione said, welcome to the first meeting and the p-place where we\'ll be practising for all the future sessions--\'

\'What are we doing?\' Smith demanded.

*Rude. Nev's helping you, and you can't even listen to him for*

*a few minutes.*

\'W-we\'ll be testing the Shield Charm and the Disarming Charm.\' Nev\'s eyes glinted. \'Split into pairs, one can shield and the other can try and disarm. Does anyone want to demonstrate?'

Harry stepped forward. 'I will. With *Smith.'*

'Good idea.' Nev stepped back.

The others backed away from the Hufflepuff student. \'Ready, Smith?\' Harry asked.

Smith shrugged and stuck his hands in his pocket. \'I can\'t

cast the Shield Charm.'

Harry\'s jelly-legs jinx hit him square in the face and he collapsed on the floor, swearing profusely amidst everyone\'s laughter.

\'What the hell was that for, Potter?\' Smith spat.

Harry fixed him with a cold stare and he quailed. \'If you\'re going to come here and ask for Nev's help, then you should be polite and not interrupt. I\'ll undo the jinx once you\'ve apologised.\'

\'Fine,\' Smith muttered. \'I apologise for interrupting. Happy?\'

\'If I\'m not, you'll find out soon enough.\'

Nev performed the counter to the jinx. Smith pushed himself off the floor and slunk back into the group.

\'Right.\' Nev conjured his own shining silver shield. \'The Shield Charm is about intent to protect, if your focus is strong enough it can be an effective barrier against most spells.\'

\'What one isn\'t it effective against?\' Terry Boot asked.

\'Ones powerful enough to break your shield of magic, or ones with potent enough intent to simply pierce through it,\' Nev said. \'The Unforgivables require such strong intent just to successfully cast that no Shield Charm can deflect them.\'

\'So dodge those ones,\' Ron grunted.

Katie squeezed Harry's wrist. \'Or you\'ll end up with a really

big scar on your face,\' she whispered.

'Hush, you,' he whispered back. 'This is no place for your glibness and sarcasm. Professor Longbottom will spank you.'

'I don't think so.' Katie giggled. 'He didn't do anything about Smith being a prick. Seems more likely *you'd* spank me for him.'

Harry chuckled. 'No, I know you too well. You'd just enjoy it.' Katie turned a little pink and grinned. 'Only because it's *you*,

Harry.'

Harry snorted. 'Have you learnt the fire-proofing charm yet?

You might need it if *someone* hears you talking like that.'

Katie's smile slipped a fraction and her hand fell back to her side. 'I actually *do* know that spell.' She winced. 'That's not why, though. Obviously.'

Harry laughed. 'You probably learnt it so you could set people's brooms on fire during casual quidditch games and not get burnt yourself.'

\'Split up into pairs,\' Nev instructed. \'Fortunately, there\'s an even number of us, so nobody will be left out.\'

The group separated and drifted apart across the room.

Harry sat down on the floor and let out a long sigh as some life crept back into his legs.

Katie plopped down beside him, bumping his knee with hers and tugging her skirt hem down her thighs. 'Look. They've all given us loads of space, just in case you decide to start icing people again.'

'I'll ice you.' Harry leant his head back against the wall. 'Or I would, if I could be bothered.'

'You'd miss me.' Katie nudged his knee with hers. 'Oi, come

on.'

Madam Pomfrey forbade me from doing anything

strenuous,\' Harry said. \'I\'m afraid I have to sit here and watch.\'

Katie beamed. \'You know I\'ll hex you on the floor just as

happily as if you were standing.'

\'You wouldn\'t assault someone who\'s ill, would you?\'

She inspected him. \'I suppose you do look moderately awful.

Is it contagious?\'

'Bit late now.' Harry measured the distance between them with one finger. 'You're probably infected already. Or you would be, if it was actually contagious.'

\'Good.' Katie leant back against the wall. 'I can probably skip one session of practice. I suspect they\'ll need more than one meeting to get the hang of this spell.\'

An array of slight shimmers and patches of bright light, wavered and flickered throughout the room. A blonde Ravenclaw

paired with Ginny produced an odd, grey-tinted nebulous shield that deflected hexes at random into the other pairs around her.

\'Not going to practise, Harry?\' Nev asked. \'Even Cedric\'s practising with the older students.\'

Harry glanced over at where Cedric was repeatedly producing a bright flash of light. \'They\'re trying to do it wordlessly.\'

\'Can *you* do that?\' Katie asked.

Harry nodded. \'Yes. Although it's not as strong as my verbal

version yet.\'

Nev stuck a hand out at Katie. \'Want to practise with me, then. Your partner seems unwilling.\'

Katie beamed, but shook her head. \'That\'s alright, Neville. It\'s quite comfy here and I\'m fairly good at casting them already.\'

\'You need to keep an eye on them.\' Harry grinned and inclined his head in the direction of the twins, who'd stopped attempting to shield and disarm and were busy casting tripping jinxes at Ron.

\'Fred, George,\' Nev called, trying not to laugh as Ron stumbled and bounced off Hermione\'s shield to land face first on the floor. \'Leave him be while he\'s practising.\'

Ron rose from the stone, nursing a red mark on his forehead, and glared at his elder siblings.

\'Sorry, Ronniekins,\' they sniggered, returning to their

practice.

\'So why're you here if you aren\'t going to take part or teach?\'

Katie asked.

'I said I'd come.\' Harry shrugged. 'I'll probably teach them all the patronus, too. Not today, though.'

Zacharias Smith managed to only shield his back and his

wand sailed from his hand to bounce across in front of Harry's feet.

\'He\'s not very good, is he?\' Katie said.

\'Maybe he\'s only planning on running away like Umbridge insists so he only wants to protect his back,\' Harry suggested.

\'I am not.\' Smith scowled and retrieved his wand. 'Shut up,

Potter.'

then.'

Harry smirked. \'You\'re not going to last very long in a duel,

Smith stalked away.

Katie sidled a little closer across the floor and yawned,

resting her head on Harry' shoulder. 'Wake me up if something interesting happens.'

'Do I look like a pillow?'

'No.' Katie squirmed around on his shoulder, then grabbed a cushion that appeared in her lap and tucked it under her head. 'You don't feel like one, either.' She closed her eyes.

*I still need to enchant the list, but I can relax for a bit.* Harry tilted his head back against the wall and let the sound of shields and wands skittering over stone fade away.

Something nudged his foot. \'I think that\'s enough for one meeting.' Nev stepped away into the middle of the room. 'Keep an eye on your badges for the time of the next meeting, we'll try to organise them around things like quidditch.\'

cheek.

'Wakey wakey, sleeping beauty.' Harry patted Katie on the

Her eyelids flickered and she yawned. 'You're meant to kiss

sleeping beauty to wake her up, Harry.'

'I prefer to live,' Harry said. '*Someone's* not a sharer.'

Katie blinked and bolted upright. 'Well, you missed your chance, Harry.' A wicked glint rose in her eye. 'Unless you *didn't* and took your chance to cop a feel of me while I was sleeping.' She cupped her boobs and smoothed out her skirt. 'Nope, everything seems to be in the right place.' She winked. 'Guess you've gotten away with it this time.'

Heat crept onto his face. 'Like I said, I choose life.'

Katie laughed. 'Don't worry, I wouldn't tell her. I don't want

your death on my conscience.'

The other students dispersed, leaving Nev and Hermione in the centre of the room alone.

Harry followed Katie out and round the corner. 'I'll catch you in five, need to check when Nev wants me to teach the patronus.'

'I'll get us a chair in the common room.' Katie bounded away. 'I could live with you having your *own* chair,' Harry called

after her.

*But I'll probably fall asleep straight away anyway.* He

dragged a little more magic up from the remaining dregs and disillusioned himself, slipping back along the wall.

\'You think we should hide the list in there?\' Hermione asked Nev, looking at the wall where the Room of Requirement would form.

\'Yeah.\' Nev nodded. \'I tried to hide it earlier and found a huge room of hidden stuff. Not much chance of anyone finding it, someone in the group might guess that\'s where we\'ve put it, but it won't be easy to find even if they find the hidden room.\'

'Let's see what you've found.' Hermione turned and opened

the door to the room.

Harry slipped through the door after them. *It might actually be tricky to explain how Umbridge found it, but I guess as long as I'm not a suspect, it doesn't matter.*

\'We need to put it somewhere we'll be able to find it again.\' Hermione stared around at the mountains of things. 'Pick something easy to recognise.'

They strode a few paces into the room and stopped by an ugly looking warlock.

Nev grinned. \'He\'ll do as a landmark. We won\'t be able to forget that face.\'

Hermione tucked the list underneath the bust, then drew out her wand and cast a couple of spells. \'An anti-summoning enchantment, just in case anyone finds out it\'s in here and tries to find it.\'

*found it.*

*Smart. There goes my first explanation of how Umbridge*

Harry crouched down in a small gap across from the bust

next to a tarnished, silver circlet and a small collection of dust-coated

bottles of fire whiskey. The sapphire-adorned tiara sparkled and shone like sunlight on water.

*Pretty.* Harry glanced back toward the door as it closed, then stood up and dispelled his disillusionment with a sigh. *But not why I'm here.*

\'Accio ink, accio quill,\' he murmured, pulling the list out from under the bust.

He plucked a bottle of ink from the air, sending a dozen more sailing away into a mountain of chairs, and snatched the least broken quill from the scatter at his feet. Harry imbued his intent to conceal into the ink, grimacing at the toll, then dipped the quill in. He sketched a circle, labelled it with the runes for creature, keeper, and home, then drew a meandering trail from it to a final rune, Ehwaz, the Futhark representation of advancement and progress.

*Ambiguous enough I can twist it to mean whatever I like later.* Harry allowed himself a small, thin smile as the ink faded from sight. *Follow the spiders, Umbridge. Follow the spiders*.

He leant against the bust and closed his eyes for a moment,

letting some of the weight slide off him. 'Almost there, Harry.'

*Umbridge will need to be able to find it.* He coaxed one last shred of magic forth and cast a faint compulsion to keep upon the list. *Marietta can feed her a landmark and then the charm will do the rest.*

Harry picked up the warm silver and sapphire circlet, frowning as it gave a soft chitter and shivered on his palm. 'Weird.' He placed it on the bust of the warlock. 'There, very obvious.'

He took a deep breath and imbued the second part of the enchantment into the parchment as Fleur had shown him. *I just need a phrase to activate the revealing part.* Harry tapped his wand upon

his palm and stared round the room. His eyes fell upon a stack of old,

faded, yellow leaflets with Grindelwald's mark at its top. *Perfect. What could be more appropriate for a man who'd sacrifice a child to save a country?*

\'For the greater good,\' he whispered, tucking the list and map underneath the bust.

# Cetus's Release

The stars twinkled high above the shadows of neat hedges and the dark spread of neat-trimmed lawns. A peacock cried somewhere in the distance.

Cissy sighed. 'That's probably the last one of them being

eaten by that awful snake.'

Bella cocked her head. 'Nagini?' She shrugged. 'If the peacock doesn't want to be eaten, it should put up more of a fight. They're pretty, useless creatures.'

A soft sniffle came from behind her. 'Aren't we all,' Cissy

whispered. 'Aren't we all.'

Bella huffed. 'Come on itty bitty baby Cissy.' She swivelled and prodded her sister in the stomach. 'We're going to go find Andi. Don't be so miserable.' She grabbed Cissy's arm, pictured the handsome, wooden lodge with its country lawns and hunting grounds, then apparated them across the country.

An old, collapsed pile of timbers sprawled before long, tangled grass fields and gnarled woods.

'Well, Andi's not here,' Bella muttered. 'What happened to

this place, it's so *messy!'*

Cissy stepped alongside her, the hem of her dark blue dress

rippling in the faint breeze. 'How much do you remember, Bella?'

*Good question, Bell.* She clawed her way into the fog, into flashes of faces, white masks, silver masks, bright colours, burning flesh, screams, shouts, cries, and cackles. *Not much, Bella. But that's*

*fine. We don't need to remember all the games we've played to*

*enjoy the next one.*

'Not much,' Cissy muttered. 'Do you remember what

happened before all the fighting?'

'Of course.' Bella bobbed her head. Snatches of stone walls, suits of armour, paintings, lessons and children's faces flitted through her thoughts. Her two sisters hung at the centre of them all, smiling and laughing. 'There was us three and some school stuff.'

Cissy's frown lines deepened. 'Yes. And after that?'

Bella strained into the fog. 'I'm not sure.' She shrugged and bounced from foot to foot. 'Does it matter?'

'It does if you want to find Andi.' Cissy swept her long, straight blonde hair off her face. 'What are you going to do if we find her, Bella?'

'Bring her back, of course.'

'She might be happier where she is\...'

'Nuh uh.' Bella shook her head and stamped her foot. 'Andi's our sister. She'll be happiest with us.'

Cissy sighed. 'Well, I don't think Andi will agree with that.' 'She's being silly.' Bella blinked. 'What happened to make her

so silly?'

'What happened?' Cissy choked. '*We grew up*. Well, the two

of us did. Nobody's sure about you.' Bella huffed. 'Don't be mean.'

Cissy pulled her wand out and righted the rusted iron bench, conjuring a thick blanket to cover it. 'Sit down, Bella.' She took a seat and patted the remaining space. 'I think I need to tell you about everything that happened.'

*What does it matter, Bella? We're still going to get her back.* Bella squirmed on the spot, tugging at the silk sleeve of her purple dress. *But she's our sister, Bell. We should listen to her.*

She plopped down on the other half of the blanket. 'Go on

then.'

Cissy tucked her wand away. 'You were never the same after

your accident, Bella. I think Andi wanted to get away, especially when you were so *involved* in the Dark Lord's fighting. She hated it. And she hated herself for being the reason.'

'That's silly.' Bella frowned. 'I'm just the same as I was.

Nothing's happened to me.'

*Not quite true, Bella.* In her mind's eye, threads of purple magic drifted from her limbs like loose spider web. *We're a little bit mad, remember?*

'You shouldn't be the same.' Cissy grabbed her shoulder. 'Everyone else changed, but you, you're still just like the little girl you were, only you're not a little girl and you don't stick to little girl's games.'

Bella scrunched her face up. 'Just tell me what happened,

Cissy.'

'A lot of Andi's friends and family died, Bella.'

'So did ours!' Bella folded her arms. 'That's what happens!

That's how it works! You win and you live, or you lose and you die.'

*I don't want to die.* Dark, polished marble flashed before Bella's eyes and a shudder rippled down her spine. *Nobody wants to die, Bella.*

Cissy pinched the bridge of her nose. 'Well, Andi didn't like it. She didn't like that we were on the other side. She'd already cut off all contact and got thrown out of the family, but she disappeared. Her daughter works at the Ministry, but she won't speak a word to me.' Cissy dabbed at her eyes. 'Our own niece... I wanted her and Draco to be friends. He doesn't have many real friends, just that pair of thick boys and Pansy Parkinson. *She's* nice enough, but not very bright or very pretty.'

'Cousins.' Bella shook her head. 'Do you know Sirius complained about my singing for the whole time we were stuck in Azkaban? He never talked to me nicely, either.' She pouted. 'And then he left me behind. *Again.*'

A strained laugh slipped through Cissy's lips. 'Yes, well. He wasn't on our side, either.'

Bella screwed her face up. 'Then why was he in there?'

'He got blamed for the Potters' deaths. Their other friend, the little ugly one, he was the real culprit.'

A little warmth spread through Bella's chest. 'Oh, that's good.

It's just part of the game, then. I thought he didn't like me.'

Cissy stared at her with big, blue eyes; the starlight turned her skin as pale as porcelain around them. 'The Potter boy would've made a good friend for Draco, too, but Dumbledore's lot got to him and he turned Draco away. Poor Draco, I often told him how nice it would be for him and his cousin to be together at school before his first day. I think he was very upset it didn't work out.'

*Potter... Potter\...* The word stirred something in the fog. *The boy who brought down the Dark Lord, Bella.*

'What's he like? The Potter boy?'

Cissy shrugged. 'Depends who you ask. Draco says he's good at quidditch, but otherwise very average.' She glanced around. 'The Dark Lord said that *Lily* Potter did something that caused his near death, not the boy.'

'I don't remember her.' Bella bounced on the bench and kicked her feet. 'What about Andi? And her daughter?' She paused. 'Wait. *Daughter.* Who did she marry? Was it Nott in the end?'

Cissy frowned and wrinkled her slim nose. 'It was never going to be Nott. No, she married the muggleborn. Ted Tonks.'

Boiling heat bubbled in Bella's veins. Magic ripped out of her, slicing through the long grass like a scythe. Cissy closed her eyes and clenched her fists.

'A muggle,' Bella hissed. 'She married one of those dull creatures?! She's our *sister!* She deserves whoever the best is! Why didn't you *stop* it, Cissy!'

'A *muggleborn*not a muggle. And how could I have?' Cissy

dabbed at her eyes. 'Our niece is a good witch, at least. Nymphodora's her name. A good Black name.'

'A halfblood.' Bella spat the word out. 'She's probably got barely any magic. She'll be a rubbish player. Helpless. A *disgrace*.'

Cissy shook her head. 'No. By all accounts she's a formidable auror for her age.'

Bella slumped. 'Oh. Well, she must take after Andi, then.

That's good. I hope I can meet her.'

'She's an *auror,* Bella. And you're an escaped convict\...'

'But still family.' Bella pouted. 'We can talk nicely before we start playing!'

'We should go back.' Cissy shivered. 'Andi's not here. I don't know where she is. I need to go home. You're not meant to be out here, either.'

Bella giggled. 'The Dark Lord will only care if we're caught.' 'And what if we *are* caught?'

'The only one who can beat me is the Dark Lord.' Bella swung her feet. 'I'll just beat all the others.' She cocked her head. 'I want to see Andi, baby Cissy. How can we find her?'

Cissy sighed. 'Any way I can think of, I've already tried. I think she lives somewhere in the muggle world, where we can't reach her.'

Bella scowled. 'That's sneaky. I can't think like a stupid muggle.'

'Exactly.' Cissy stood up. 'Now, let's go back, Bella. It's too late for us all to be sisters again.'

*But we don't need to think like a muggle, Bella. We can get a*

*muggle to do that.* Bella bobbed her head and jumped to her feet. *We just need to find one and make them search, Bell.*

'Ok, Cissy.' She patted her sister on the head. 'I'll try and find you some new pretty pets first. Ones that can put up more fight than a peacock.'

Cissy stared at her, then shook her head and vanished with a loud crack.

Bella shrugged and twirled on the spot. 'Let's go find a muggle, Bell.' She closed her eyes and apparated to the top of the hill. 'It can't be hard. They're everywhere, like rats.'

A cluster of harsh, bright lights shone at the far end of the

valley.

*There we go, Bella.*

She apparated her way down a few fields at a time, then

followed the dark, hard road into the middle of a muggle town.

'Urgh.' Bella peered around. 'There's no magic at all. It's such a boring, dead place.'

A man lurched round the corner and stopped dead. 'Woah, lady!' He staggered toward her with his hand raised. 'Ain't smart for you to be about here looking all posh and rich by yourself. Can't trust everyone to be decent folk.'

Bella cocked her head and danced toward him. 'Hello

muggle.'

'You drunk, love?' He scratched his face and fumbled

through his clothes. 'Let me call you a taxi or something. Get you back home safe, yeah. Your boyfriend or husband's probably worried sick.'

She slid her wand out of her dress. 'Imperio.'

His eyes glazed and he went still.

'I need to find Andi.' Bella pouted. 'She's hiding in your muggle world and I don't know how to find her. You're looking for...'

She clawed through the fog the name Cissy'd given her. 'Ted Tonks.'

She stuck her tongue out. 'Urgh, it even tastes boring.'

'Ted Tonks.' The muggle swayed on his feet. 'Find Ted

Tonks.'

'Oh.' Bella pressed the tip of her wand to his neck. 'And so I

know what you do.' An ink raven spread its dark wings beneath his skin and faded out of sight. 'Now, let's get baby Cissy a present to cheer her up.'

# Remorsemordre

The stack of books on the edge of Salazar's desk teetered

and thumped to the floor.

\'Be careful with those!\' Salazar scowled. \'They're *old* books!

You have to treat old things with care.'

'*You're* old.' Harry restacked the books. 'And none of these have anything on what actually happens to prophecies after they're given.'

Salazar nodded. 'In my day, they were just told to whoever was nearby. They spread mostly by rumour, unless someone managed to stamp it out.'

'Great.' Harry sighed. 'I imagine Voldemort is exactly the sort who'd do some stamping.'

Salazar's green eyes softened. 'Yes. He may well have. I would certainly keep something like that to myself if I could.'

'So how am I meant to find out what it says?' Harry demanded. 'Ask Voldemort?'

'It *is* a dilemma.' Salazar stroked his goatee. 'But I would imagine, if the Ministry is able to interfere in the practice and use of magic as much as it seems, then it must have its claws in prophecy recording. People in power generally like to know about prophecies.'

'The Ministry probably isn't going to be keen to help either.' Harry scowled. 'In fact, Voldemort will probably be more likely to help me.'

'A problem for another time.\' Salazar leant a little further forward, dislodging the serpent from around his neck. A slender, silver chain hung beneath its scales. 'How's the plan to get Dumbledore off your back going?'

'And getting rid of Umbridge. I can't leave her to run riot in

his absence.'

'That too. Now stop playing coy and tell me how it's going?'

\'I\'m one spell away from getting rid of Dumbledore for as long as the Ministry remains against him and I can\'t see a way it will fail.\' Harry smiled. \'Even Voldemort's horcrux couldn\'t come so close.\'

\'Just because you cannot see a way, doesn't mean it doesn\'t

exist,\' Salazar said.

\'I know.' Harry leant back in Salazar's chair. 'I don't see how he could stay, though. Not without outright turning on the Ministry and I don't think he'd do that when he wants to eventually unite everyone against Voldemort.'

\'Would you care to share this work of genius with me?\'

\'Dumbledore's been keeping too close an eye on me.

Between his control of the wards and Snape's *lessons,* I can't get out to do anything he might suspect me of. And the moment he realises I might be trouble, he'll dispose of his sacrifice.\'

\'You think you\'ve found a way to outmanoeuvre Albus Dumbledore? Tom was always wary of him for a reason.\'

\'He thinks I am on his side, still.\' Harry shrugged. \'And why wouldn't he? The other sides are Voldemort, who murdered my parents and keeps trying to kill me, or the Ministry, who continue to slander me.\'

Salazar nodded. \'So you intend to take him by surprise?

Smart. Against stronger prey, a serpent strikes from hiding.\'

\'I *will* take him by surprise. Nev has started illicitly teaching students and I managed to get them to name themselves Dumbledore\'s Army.\' Harry grinned. \'Once the group's discovered, there'll be nothing Dumbledore can do. Umbridge will leap at the chance to oust him and control the school. Either he tries to fight the Ministry, which helps Voldemort, or he lets the Ministry expel thirty of the students including his martyr and those closest to him. He *definitely* can't allow that.\'

\'It's no more than he deserves for trying to sacrifice a member of my family.\' Salazar's eyes darkened. 'Were I more than a shadow of magic and canvas, I would rip him limb from limb.' His wand fountained green and silver sparks and the snake cowered behind his neck. 'What about the woman?'

\'On the back of the list is a map, one that I drew and concealed with an enchantment requiring an activation phrase---'

\'Where did you learn to do that? I never taught you any enchanting.\'

\'Fleur's very good at it.\' A smile crept onto Harry's face.

\'She\'s taught me a few little pieces when I\'ve asked.\'

\'All that time in France was worthwhile after all.'

'I will burn you to ash, you half-sentient corridor graffiti.' Harry narrowed his eyes at Salazar until the painting raised his palms. 'The map appears to lead into the forest to something important, I intend to entice Umbridge into investigating it. She seems like she'll be easily baited.\'

A small smile crooked Salazar's lips. \'I assume she won\'t be

coming back from her investigation.'

Harry's smile turned cold. \'No. She won\'t. There're an awful lot of acromantula in that part of the forest, with a little help she\'ll wander right into the middle of their nest unaware. Good riddance. She's exactly the sort who'd put on robes and a mask for Voldemort if she thought she could get away with it.\'

'And how then will you use this moment of freedom?\' Salazar drummed his fingers on the head of his snake. 'It's worth more than a few extra days in France, Harry.'

*Nothing's worth more than my time with Fleur.* Harry stifled a sharp pang. *That's why I'm doing all of this.*

\'I think my godfather will tell me a lot of useful things about the Department of Mysteries once it looks a bit more like Dumbledore's not in total control.\' Harry tapped the time turner. \'If the worst comes to the worst, I can use this to go back and change my conversations with Sirius until it works.'

*Maybe he knows about the prophecy.* Harry recalled all the things he'd heard about his parents. *They were hiding under the Fidelius, they must've been hiding for a reason. Maybe the Order knows about this prophecy as well. Dumbledore probably does. He always knows.*

\'You\'re willing to experiment with it now?\' Salazar's face lit

up.

\'No.\' Harry rolled his eyes. \'I don\'t know why you\'re so eager

to lose the only descendant you have that isn\'t a mass-murdering megalomaniac in the currents of time.\'

\'You wouldn\'t be lost,\' Salazar said.

Harry snorted. \'How would you know?\'

\'I\'m Salazar Slytherin?' \'Nice try.'

\'Fine,\' Salazar muttered. \'We'll save the experimental magic for later. Voldemort will make himself known soon. If he\'s allowed to launch a surprise attack on the Ministry, you'll find yourself hard- pressed to defeat him. He has many followers and all your allies are loyal to a man who intends to see you dead.\'

\'What can I do? The Ministry won't listen and Dumbledore already knows.'

'The Ministry's not just the handful of people you've seen, many others may be aware or more open to reason than the official stance might imply.' Salazar folded his arms. \'If more proof than just words is seen\... Enough to be beyond reasonable doubt\...'

Harry considered it. \'The papers always talk about how there's no proof of his return except the word of Dumbledore and myself.\'

\'Anything specific?\'

\'Voldemort was reported dead thirteen years ago, though no body was found. They usually cite the lack of the Dark Mark to prove it's not Death Eaters.\'

Salazar spread his arms. \'There you have it.'

\'What do I have?\' Harry asked.

'That Dark Mark. If that appears somewhere noticeable in a

manner that can't be ignored, then people may think twice about the

Ministry\'s propaganda. Fear like Voldemort must've inspired isn't

easily forgotten.\'

\'The Ministry will cover it up,\' Harry said.

\'So find someone willing to publish or spread the story, or make it so spectacular that it cannot be ignored,\' Salazar said. 'Even if it's not a complete success, it will still help.'

'There *is* the issue of finding out how to cast it.'

'Find one of his followers.' Salazar's green eyes hardened. 'You've grown adept with the Mind Arts, tear the spell from their mind. Kill them afterward if you must. These aren't innocent lives to be saved, Harry. They're not errant children. They will kill you if you give them the chance to.'

\'I suspect most of them are with Voldemort, but I\'ll ask around. Sirius might know of some.' Harry reached for the mirror and dragged the chair into the darkest corner. \'Don\'t say anything, he has sharp hearing.\' He raised the mirror. \'Sirius.'

The white glow of the mirror shone in the gloom of the study as Harry extinguished the lights one at a time.

\'Harry.\' Sirius' face appeared, a deep frown on his brows. \'This isn\'t the best time. Podmore got himself caught and sentenced to time in Azkaban for being somewhere he shouldn\'t've been.\'

\'He\'s an order member?\' Harry asked.

*What was he doing?*

\'Yes, we\'re trying to re-organise everything so it works without him, but it\'s proving difficult.\'

\'I've a question, just a quick one.\' Harry offered Sirius a grin. \'Are there any former Death Eaters I should be looking out for, ones that aren\'t obvious?\'

Sirius snorted. \'I can think of one or two straight off the top of my head. There're a handful of those who were acquitted under suspicious circumstances like Malfoy and that axe-wielding maniac, Macnair, but the only one close enough to be a risk to you is Snape, though Dumbledore assures us he\'s trustworthy.\'

\'Snape?\' Harry's eyebrows shot up.

*Surely it can't be that easy. My luck's never that good. He's already connecting our minds in detention, all I'd have to do is exploit it somehow.*

\'Oh yes.\' Sirius glowered. \'Don\'t turn your back on Snivellus, he\'s not to be blindly trusted, no matter what Dumbledore says.\'

'He does hate you and my father.' Harry recalled Snape's

half-compliments and neutral expression. 'Did he know my mother?'

Sirius nodded. 'They were friends. Good friends. Knew each other before Hogwarts. Apparently, he was a decent boy before he went into Slytherin and fell in with the wrong crowd, but he always seemed a greasy, spiteful, sour bastard to me.'

*Perfect. I've my distraction, then. I just have to turn up to my*

*detention in a short while.*

He weighed up one last toss of the dice. 'Well, I\'ll be taking Dumbledore\'s advice with a pinch of salt from now on, too. A former Death Eater shouldn\'t be teaching at a school.\'

Sirius wrestled with that. \'He doesn\'t always make the best decisions.' He sighed. \'Sorry, Harry, I have to go, this is quite serious. All hands on deck.\'

\'Bye, Sirius.\' Harry set the mirror down.

\'Did I understand that correctly?\' Salazar's speech wavered between English and Parseltongue. \'Your teacher, the wizard Dumbledore forced you into learning occlumency from without knowing you could even defend your mind, was, and likely still is, a Death Eater.\'

\'I believe so,\' Harry said.

\'If I were still alive.\' Green and silver sparks showered down

at Salazar's feet. The serpent bared its fangs and hissed.

\'But it means he knows how to conjure the Dark Mark.\' \'What will you do?\'

\'Like you said, I'll take it from his mind.\' He stood up. \'I promised I\'d practice with Nev for the first time before my detention, so I have to go, but I\'ll be ready.\'

\'It won\'t be easy. He seems an accomplished occlumens.' Salazar frowned. 'You'll need to manipulate him into showing you of his own free will.'

\'Nothing necessary is easy.\' Harry shot Salazar a bitter smile. \'I was going to shock him. I have the memory of my mother's death. They were close friends, once. It ought to give me a few moments and I can memory charm my intrusion afterward. The memory of my mother's death ought to be strong enough to cover for any chance of him remembering.\'

Salazar nodded. 'As good a plan as any.' His expression darkened. 'If it goes wrong, Harry. Kill him. He's too dangerous to be left between you, Dumbledore and Voldemort if he knows too much. Even if you have to flee the country because Dumbledore discovers you, it's better than being led to slaughter later.'

*I could go to Fleur. Maybe. Her parents probably wouldn't like that, though.* Harry strode up to the bathroom, turning things over in his head. *I need the incantation and the intent, that's all. If he was a Death Eater, there'll be a connection. It'll only take a second.*

Harry stepped out into Myrtle\'s bathroom, splashing across the floor toward the exit.

\'Harry?\' The ghost drifted through the side of her cubicle.

\'It\'s me, Myrtle.\' He smiled at her. \'How've you been? Seen

anyone in the Prefect\'s Bathroom lately?\'

\'Not that I was interested in.\' She sighed. \'But I did once watch Cedric Diggory and his girlfriend take a very long *bath* together.\'

\'I did *not* need to know that,\' Harry said.

\'There aren\'t many attractive male prefects at the moment,\' she moaned. \'You\'d be surprised how many couples I\'ve seen in there, though.\' She gave him a rather wicked glance. \'I remember a certain dark-haired head boy and red-haired head girl going there together once.\'

*My parents. Urgh.*

\'Thanks for that image, Myrtle. I'm afraid I need to go, Nev\'s

waiting for me. Take care.\'

She laughed and flushed dark silver. \'I\'m dead, Harry. The

only thing that can reach me is regret.'

He hurried through the corridors to Gryffindor Tower, whispers dogging his steps.

'Where's his glasses?' one girl asked.

'Who cares?' another whispered. 'He looks better without

them.'

Nev leant against the wall next to the Fat Lady, watching,

with some apprehension, as she lectured about singing. \'Perfect timing. Are we going up to the seventh floor?\'

Harry considered it. \'There's not much point. It won't look like we're doing much. We\'ll just go in there.\' He led Nev into a nearby empty classroom and closed the door, throwing up a silencing charm for good measure.

\'I\'ve got the hang of clearing my thoughts.\' Nev said. \'Even when I was angry in Umbridge\'s lesson.\'

\'Well we\'ll find out how well in a moment.' \'What're we doing?\'

Harry adopted a sombre expression. \'I'll connect our minds and attempt to see your thoughts, feelings, and memories. You'll do your utmost to stop me from seeing anything.\' He sighed. 'It won't be fun, Nev. It will help you a lot, though.'

\'Will it hurt?\' Nev asked.

\'Yes, but you\'ll be a better wizard for it.\'

*That's how it works.* Fleur's voice drifted up from the back of his mind. *The more it hurts to have, the more satisfying it'll be to get it.*

\'Then let\'s go.\' Nev sat on the desk and braced himself, gripping it with both hands.

Harry slipped his wand from his sleeve. 'Legilimens.'

He spared no effort from the spell. Nev\'s thoughts swam before his eyes. Admiration hovered in his thoughts, loyalty, devotion, glimpses and flashes of their time together flitted through their joined minds.

Harry broke the connection. \'Try again, Nev. It\'s not at all

easy. Legilimens.'

Nev struggled to smother the stream, but his thoughts smoothed, the feelings grew less strong, and the glimpses grew faint and few.

Harry released the spell. 'That was better. Well done.'

\'What're you doing when you cast that spell?\' Nev asked. 'You saw all my memories of when you were helping me.\' He squirmed. \'You went through every moment in which I was grateful to you.\'

\'I form a connection between our minds with it,\' Harry said. \'It enables me to see what you're thinking, if I can then get you to think about what I want to know, I win.\'

\'You aren\'t going easy on me, are you?\' Nev asked. \'I\'ve never done well with anything the second time I tried.\'

\'I\'m not trying any of the more insidious, cruel methods of seeing what I want,\' Harry said. \'I'm teaching you to clear your mind enough to resist, not protect a single thought from me.\'

\'Try,\' Neville demanded. \'Do your worst.\'

\'Do you realise what you\'re asking, Neville?\' Harry murmured. \'I can drag every one of your worst memories up and suspend you in them, twisting them about one another in a grotesque parody of a nightmare until your sanity leaves you.\'

Nev swallowed hard. \'Do it. Those Death Eaters will try,

won't they?\'

\'Legilimens,\' Harry hissed.

The moment the connection formed, he fed a scatter of images to his friend. The circle of masked Death Eaters in the graveyard, the fear of the basilisk, his heartbeat pounding in his head, the cold adrenaline racing in his veins, then pain of the Cruciatus Curse, the endless torment of an instant. A torrent of emotion flooded Nev's mind: fear of the Death Eaters, burning rage and the face of Bellatrix Lestrange, the hollow, empty eyes of his broken parents in the ever so white ward of St Mungo\'s.

Harry ended the spell and Nev slumped over on the desk holding his temples, tears running down his cheeks.

\'I\'m sorry, Nev.' Harry put a hand on his shoulder. 'You weren\'t ready to face something like that so early. I shouldn\'t have let you convince me.\'

Nev wiped his tears away. \'I'll get better.\'

\'You should bear in mind that I'm quite talented in the Mind Arts,\' Harry said. \'They're an obscure field I intend to master.\'

\'Did I do well?\' Nev asked. \'I know you saw everything, but I didn\'t do too badly, did I?\'

'You did exceptionally well to be honest, Nev. You successfully managed to clear your thoughts when in pain. Keep practising it, whenever you\'re angry, or sad, or at all emotional try to empty your mind and you'll quickly improve.\'

\'Are we done?\' Nev asked.

\'I think you\'ve suffered enough for one day.\' Harry smiled. \'I have to go and endure detention with Snape, now.\'

\'You showed me things,\' Nev whispered. \'You showed what it felt like to be under the Cruciatus Curse.\'

\'I\'m sorry,\' Harry said. 'You asked for my worst, but I shouldn't have given it to you.'

\'Don\'t apologise,\' Nev snapped. \'I asked for it and I\'m glad I did, it helped me understand.\'

\'Understand what?\'

\'When I was younger I used to resent my parents for not being stronger,' Nev muttered. \'It was a horrible thing to do and I *know* how wrong it is, but I couldn\'t help it, until now I still hated them a little bit for not managing to resist, to stay sane, so I would've had parents like everyone else. I understand now. I can\'t explain how much it means to only be proud.\'

A little pang twisted in Harry's chest. \'You don\'t need to, Nev. Until I knew what happened to my parents, I hated them with every fibre of my being for leaving me. Feelings like that, they don't fade easily.\' He let his hand slip off Neville\'s shoulder and pulled him

up onto his feet. \'You should head back to the common room. We\'ve got an astronomy essay to do for the end of the next lesson.\'

\'Don\'t remind me,\' Neville groaned. \'Every single planet seems to be in some phase that indicates danger or imminent death. It\'s like how you used to describe Divination to us.\'

\'It might be a valid prediction.\' Harry grinned. \'Because if I hear Professor Sinistra reverently whisper the phrase *Uranus is illuminated,* I might not be able to stop laughing before I suffocate.\'

Neville chuckled. \'I guess I\'d best get started. You already did some yesterday, so I have to catch up.\'

\'We\'re both still ahead of Ron,\' Harry said. \'I overheard Hermione telling him twice yesterday that if he\'d paid any attention he\'d know that there hadn\'t been a full eclipse in over two years so he couldn\'t possibly have written about it for his whole essay.\'

\'I doubt he cares.\' Nev opened the door. 'At all.'

\'You\'re probably right,\' Harry said. \'If you\'re still up when I get back from Snape\'s detention, do you want to help me enchant all of Ron\'s chess pieces to switch sides mid-game?\'

\'Can you do that?\'

\'Oh yes.\' Harry grinned. \'He always swears when he plays, so if I use the word *bloody* as the activation phrase, I can make them all change sides at least twenty times a game.\'

\'Can\'t they just ignore it?\' Nev asked.

\'Not if I do different swear words for different pieces.\' Harry smirked and started down the stairs to the dungeons. \'Then they\'ll all change at different points.\'

\'I think I can see where Katie learnt it all from.\' Nev laughed and disappeared up the stairs toward the common room.

Harry continued on down towards Snape\'s office and its collection of interesting jars. *Time to get my hands on that spell.*

\'Potter.\' Snape loomed out of the shadows across from the

door to his office. \'You're early.\'

\'Better early than late, sir,\' Harry said.

\'Come in.\' Snape swept from the shadows of the alcove into his office.

Harry peered into the dark and found nothing but a small dust-blanketed corner. *There's no secret passage. Why was he even out here?*

\'We will start where we left off.\' Snape pulled his wand out.

'Legilimens.'

Harry pushed the memory to the surface, forcing it into Snape\'s view. *Not Harry*, *please no, take me instead---* A flash of green tore through their thoughts.

Heart-wrenching agony and guilt flooded their thoughts, dragging him down into an endless deep, dark. He hurled the images of the robes and masks and men he\'d met in the graveyard into the torrent. Among the myriad of memories of murder and worse, he thrust his wand into the sky, felt the desire to spread terror and chaos, felt his magic surge. *Morsmordre!*

Harry ripped their minds apart and levelled his wand tip at Snape. 'Obliviate.' He wiped away everything but his mother's screams and the flash of green light.

\'Professor?' Harry feigned slight concern.

\'What was that, Harry?\' Snape's tone came as hollow as anything Harry'd ever heard; empty enough to conjure the cold, hungry claws of the void.

*Not so smooth and spiteful now.* Harry hid a small, cold smile. *No more jibes about the parents a lonely child so desperately wished would come and save him. Fair's fair, Snape.*

\'My earliest memory, sir,' he whispered. 'I used to be able to remember the words for the curse. I\'ve always known them. I murmured them to myself as a child, wondering what they meant.

The dementors in my third year, they let me remember the rest. It\'s the only memory of my mother I have.\'

\'I\'m sorry.' All the soft strength fled Snape's voice. \'Please --

please leave.\'

Harry turned on his heel and strode out. A scream echoed from within the office. Glass shattered and purple light flickered down the corridor.

*He deserves worse for all he did as a Death Eater.* Harry all but ran back to the chamber under his disillusionment charm.

\'I have the incantation. The memory of my mother's death

caused him enough distress to give me the chance.'

Salazar's eyes filled with shadows. 'Good. Now use it. You didn't take that spell easily or lightly, don't waste it.'

*Where to cast it?* Harry ran over the few locations he could apparate to in his mind. *London. Risky. Hogsmeade makes no sense, neither does here. Godric's Hollow...*

\'I'll cast it somewhere it can't be ignored.\' A small, bitter smile curved Harry's lips. \'I\'m going home for the first time in fourteen years.\'

\'You can apparate there?\'

\'I know what it looks like, I\'ve seen enough pictures.' He pictured the streets of the village and twisted the world back past him.

him.

Harry sprawled across wet grass. Tomb stones loomed over

He snatched his wand up from the floor, his heart

hammering in his ears. The view of the street he'd seen lay at the base of the hill past the church and he released a long sigh, the adrenaline fading. Harry strode through the graveyard, glancing left and right until he found familiar names in stark, black letters on white marble.

*The last enemy to be destroyed is death*. *Voldemort might well agree.* He traced a finger over their names. *How different things might've been.* He sighed and let the emptiness claw the longing away. *There's no point hoping. I managed one perfect wish, I mustn't risk it for anything.*

He followed the row of graves toward the gate past a dozen ancient graves whose names were worn away. A sigil marked the top of the tombstone, an odd triangular shape, with some unrecognisable design inside.

*Ignotus Peverell.* Harry peered at the worn letters on the others. *Too old to read.*

A small, broken house waited in the middle of the street.

Graffiti plastered the walls.

*Well wishes and thanks for a boy who just lost everything.* Harry paused at one daubed in red. *And threats that the Dark Lord will return. They were right, I suppose.*

Flowers strewed the ground before the cold marble likenesses of his parents. Their distant, pale figures called to mind his eleven-year old self's vision in the Mirror of Erised and a terrible melancholy washed over him, seeping up from some dark, old place in his head. Sorrow hung over the stone like fog, stark grey and suffocating, so thick he could almost taste it.

Harry slipped his wand from his sleeve and pointed it up into the sky. \'Morsmordre,\' he whispered.

# The Mysterious Department

The gold and red hangings trembled in the faint breeze from the window, fluttering against the tally-marked the frame above his head. A dull rustle of clothes and sheets drifted from beyond his gaudy curtain.

\'Did you manage to get any of your essays done after I went

to bed?\' Neville's voice carried through the hangings.

\'No.' Harry pulled his robes on and dragged himself out of

bed. A faint ache sapped his limbs.

*Today will be a quiet day*.

\'It\'s due after lunch,\' Neville said.

\'I\'ll finish it in Transfiguration.\' Harry pressed his hair down with both hands, but the tufts sprang back up the instant he removed his fingers. 'Breakfast first!'

Katie warmed her feet in one of the chairs by the fire.

'Morning Harry, morning Neville.' She giggled. 'Nice hair, Harry.\'

\'Thanks.\' Harry smoothed it down, but dislodged his bag from his shoulder, spilling his Astronomy books onto the floor. 'It's just going to be one of those days, isn't it?'

Katie bounded from her chair and handed his books back to him, leading the way out of the room toward the Great Hall.

*Might as well hold onto it and do some while we eat. As*

*long as Katie doesn't spill anything, I can add an extra inch or so.*

\'Planning to get some done during breakfast?\' Neville asked.

\'Yeah. I reckon I can get a few inches in on Callisto\'s craters before we have to go to transfiguration and then I\'ll finish on Ganymede.\'

\'That should get you all the way.'

\'I remember my Owl year astronomy.\' Katie sighed. \'George and Fred developed the punching telescope that year, I\'m sure it ruined the class grades.\'

\'Is that why the three of you were always wearing eyeshadow?\' Harry asked.

A touch of red coloured Katie's cheeks. No. I might've been trying to catch someone\'s attention and Alicia and Angelina sort of emulated me.\'

\'Well, I did notice.'

Katie's blush turned a little darker. \'Who said it was you?\' Harry raised an eyebrow.

\'Fine. It was.\'

\'I knew it.\' Harry grinned. \'It did make you look cute.'

\'Cute?\' Katie scrunched up her face. \'I didn\'t want to look cute, it was supposed to make me *sexy.*\'

Harry chuckled. \'It didn\'t work.'

\'Oh look,\' Nev remarked. \'First year Hufflepuffs.\' \'No, Nev, don\'t encourage her---'

Katie took off cackling and casting corridor jinxes after them.

\'She\'d been so good until you reminded her,\' Harry chided. \'Barely an attack in the last few days.\'

The first years escaped into the Great Hall and Katie stopped to wait by the entrance.

\'Bad Katie.\' Harry wagged his finger at her as they found a space to sit. \'You\'re supposed to have been reformed.\'

\'No real Dark Lady ever reforms. Once you've chosen something, you've got to stick to it.\' Katie helped herself to orange juice. 'Especially if it's something important to you.'

*Too true.* Harry moved her goblet to the opposite side of her plate, away from his essay. He scanned the table for papers, but found only the one copy of Teen Witch Weekly. *Which I will never read. Ever.*

Katie gathered the toast, butter, and the bacon plate. Harry eyed her sandwich materials.

\'If you touch my sandwich again, I'll castrate you with this.'

She waved the butter-smeared knife under his nose. 'Bacon thief.'

'Won't that just lead to you being disappointed later, Katie?'

Nev asked.

Katie turned crimson and took a huge bite out of her sandwich.

Harry laughed. 'And finally, after weeks of being teased about Hermione, Nev gets his revenge.'

He tugged out a quill and some ink. *Now what rubbish shall I write about Callisto?*

\'Either of you know anything about Callisto?\' Harry glanced

between Neville and Katie. 'Literally anything will do.'

\'What\'s it worth?\' Katie demanded. 'I'll take payment in sexual favours...'

Harry chuckled. 'Not from me, you won't. Especially not after you've castrated me with that knife.'

\'You have to come to the next DA meeting and teach the Patronus Charm,\' Nev said.

Katie nodded. 'That or the sexual favours.'

\'Fine.' Harry pointed his quill at Katie. 'To the DA meeting.

Not whatever twisted fantasy you're coming up with over there.' She pouted. 'You can only resist for so long, Harry!\'

'You two are a weird pair.' Nev shook his head. 'Anyway, Harry's not been to a meeting since the first time and it\'s almost the beginning of the Christmas Holidays.'

\'Have they all got the hang of Shield Charms?\' Harry asked. \'Everyone\'s capable of casting most of the OWL level

spells,' Nev said. 'I\'ve been getting them to practise duelling with

each other.\'

\'That\'s a good idea,\' Harry said.

'Patronus is next.' Nev grimaced. 'Hermione *keeps* bugging

me about it.'

\'I\'ll come and teach it, then.\' Harry tapped his essay. \'Now, about Callisto?\'

\'I wrote a whole paragraph about its naming and how old it is compared to other satellites,\' Nev said. \'Try and use lots of long words to stretch things out, Ron repeated the word *the* twice every time he needed it to make it longer. He claims that nobody ever notices.\'

\'Has anyone?\' Harry asked.

\'Hermione noticed straight away. She made him rewrite it last night before you came back from detention.\'

\'That\'s a shame.\' Harry brushed crumbs off his essay. \'I

would've quite liked to see what Professor Sinistra did.\'

\'She gets very strict when anyone disrespects her subject,' Katie said. \'I heard that at the end of our OWL year she collected all the punching telescopes that Fred and George made, mixed them in with the others, and then gave them a detention separating them for all the disruption they caused.\'

\'I think that was just a rumour,\' Nev said.

\'Maybe.\' Katie took another bite out of her sandwich as she turned to Harry, scattering a few more crumbs across his essay. 'Still a good story, though.'

Harry swept the crumbs off. 'I *will* steal it if it goes on my

essay...'

\'Sorry.' She finished it in several bites and gulped down

some orange juice, then leant close and peered into his face. 'Are you really wearing pieces of plastic in your eyes, Harry? Hermione was telling everyone that must be what you were doing if you weren\'t wearing glasses anymore.\'

\'They\'re called contact lenses,\' Harry said. \'It\'s like wearing really small glasses on your eye.\'

\'That\'s kind of weird,\' Katie said. \'But you do look better without them, nobody will mistake you for Myrtle\'s descendant now.\'

\'Thanks,\' Harry said. 'You do remember we went on a date,

right?'

Katie pulled a weak grin onto her face. 'I try not to think

about it, actually.' She shifted on the bench. \'You two should probably go. You don\'t want to be late and then get caught writing an essay for Sinistra in McGonagall's lesson.\'

Harry tucked his essay back into his bag and got up. 'I'm still an inch or so short.'

Katie cackled. 'Don't worry, Harry. Not every girl's obsessed with length. Girth's important too!'

He choked. 'What?'

'What?' She beamed back at him, all bright innocence and

cheer.

Nev turned red and swung himself out from under the

bench. 'I'm still *here*, you two.'

'Well, I'm not. I'll see you later, degenerate Katie.'

'You love it, Harry.' Katie gave him a wave and knocked her

goblet over everything nearby. 'Damn it!'

\'Narrow miss that,\' Harry said as they headed toward the Middle Courtyard.

\'She has a thing for forgetting where she\'s put her drink, doesn\'t she.\' Nev laughed. \'Normally, I\'m the clumsy one.\'

\'You still are, Nev. Last time we had Potions, you nearly knocked over our cauldron and melted a desk. Katie just hates goblets for some reason.\'

Harry grabbed a seat at the back of the class and tucked his homework beneath his classwork. 'Right. One last inch or so and I'm done.' He tapped the quill on the desk.

\'Run out of ideas?\' Nev whispered. 'This Doubling Charm thing seems tricky...'

\'I feel like I\'m trying to explain what\'s in the teacup to Trelawney. It\'s painful,\' Harry complained.

\'It\'s probably a Grim.\' Nev smiled. \'Astronomy isn\'t *that* bad, though. The only things Trelawney ever predicted successfully were Hermione leaving her class and me breaking her teacup.\'

*And Pettigrew\'s escape.* Harry sliced a thin sliver of parchment off the top and bottom, then stuffed his homework back in his bag. *That'll do.*

\'My Gran\'s friend, Griselda Marchbanks, is on the Wizengamot and head of the examinations board,\' Neville muttered. \'I heard her tell Gran that the Divination OWL exam is her least favourite because the students just make stuff up and they have to pretend it\'s right because there\'s no real way of checking. She said the only real prophecies are in some mysterious department of the Ministry.\'

A jolt of cold rippled through Harry. *A mysterious department, or a Department of Mysteries?*

\'What department?\' Harry asked.

Professor McGonagall began to hand out bottle caps of Ogden\'s Whiskey to practise on. A faint whiff of alcohol reached Harry's nose when she placed his on the desk.

\'The Department of Mysteries,\' Nev said. \'It\'s supposed to have loads of weird bits of magic nobody can explain in it, but only the Unspeakables are allowed down there because of how dangerous things are.\'

\'Do you reckon they\'d send you to Azkaban for getting caught down there?\' Harry asked.

\'Probably,\' Nev said. \'If it\'s as high security as it sounds.\'

*Fleur wants to work at Les Inconnus*. *That sounds awfully similar. She might know about it.* He cursed under his breath. *I should've asked her.*

\'Sounds interesting.'

\'Mr Potter and Mr Longbottom, I severely doubt that you're discussing the Doubling Charm, so I suggest you get on and start practising,\' Professor McGonagall called.

Harry glanced at the explanation on the board. *Seems simple enough.*

\'Gemino,\' he muttered, flicking his wand at the bottle-cap and envisioning a second cap beside it.

A second bottle top formed; blurred letters marked its stop and when Harry poked it beside the original, he noticed the colours weren't quite right.

*More focus and I'll have that down.*

Nev repeated the spell next to him, flicking his wand. He caught the tip on the desk and dropped it. The bottle caps continued to multiply, showering off the desk and onto Nev who'd bent to retrieve his wand.

Professor McGonagall swept over. \'End the spell, Mr Longbottom.'

\'Finite,\' Nev muttered.

\'That's the perfect example of the as yet unexplained mystery of this charm,\' Professor McGonagall said. \'If the caster is interrupted before the spell ends, the item continues to multiply. More practice, Mr Longbottom.\' She bustled away to deal with Ron, who\'d managed to turn his top into what appeared to be a button mushroom.

Harry redid the spell, producing a perfect replica of the cap. *I should really just stop coming to lessons.* He pressed his fingertips to the acorn necklace beneath his robes. *I wish I could just leave and go to France.* A soft melancholy swelled up within his chest. *No.* He stamped the feeling out. *No hoping. Wishes are made.*

\'Can you tell Professor Sinistra that I\'m feeling ill?\' Harry

asked.

\'Are you even feeling sick?\' Nev paused in his attempt to

cast the charm and bottle caps spilt everywhere. 'Bloody hell. *Finite.*'

\'Of a sort,\' Harry said.

*Homesick.* He passed Nev his homework essay and watched the clock tick. *Not so long, then I can leave.* He closed his eyes and imagined the feel of the breeze and the smell of the willow. Fleur's warm smile crept in amongst them.

A soft chime came from the clock.

Harry stuffed everything back into his bag and slipped out as everyone tidied, hurrying toward the chamber. He splashed across Myrtle's bathroom, the acorn already in his hand, and closed the entrance behind him.

'Azure.' The necklace flowed into the form of a mirror.

Fleur's face appeared. A gleam of worry hovered in her blue eyes. \'Harry?\'

Harry felt a flood of warmth wash through him. \'I just

needed to talk to you.'

*I missed you.*

\'That\'s an interesting coincidence.\' Fleur's voice trembled. 'I ought to talk to you, too.'

'I'll be at the willow in a moment,\' he said. Fleur's face vanished.

Harry's stomach knotted and his mouth turned dry. *Is she angry with me? Did I do something?* An awful chill crept down his spine and crushed the breath from his lungs. *Does she want to leave?*

He strode into the study, grappling with a tight ball of panic,

and grabbed the portkey drawing. 'Argent.'

Rain drummed down on him, soaking into his robes. Harry transfigured a fallen stick into an umbrella large enough for two and waited.

Fleur apparated in, her face taut and her lips thin. The rain pattered on her shoulders and silver hair, then rose off her as a veil of steam.

\'What\'s wrong?\' Harry asked. 'Fleur?'

\'I did something stupid,\' she whispered.

Harry's heart plummeted and the umbrella shivered, spilling small streams of water onto the ground around him. *Perfect wishes never come true.* He smothered the flood of despair. *No. She's not said what. Don't repeat your mistakes.*

\'What did you do?\' he whispered.

\'*Non.*\' Fleur stepped under the umbrella and cupped his face in her hands. *\'Nothing* like that. You are *mine*. And that means that I'm *yours*.\'

Relief swooped through Harry's stomach. *She didn't betray me. She's not leaving.*

\'What happened?' he asked. 'Is Gabby okay? Your parents?\' \'They're fine,\' Fleur said. \'I did something stupid, is all. One

of the girls here, one who came to Hogwarts, she has family in

England, a cousin, and she was talking on and on about what the Daily Prophet has been spouting.\' Her hands slipped from his face to his shoulders, pulling him against her. \'I was so angry with her. I still am. I used Cassandra\'s Curse, but I didn't hold back. The mediwitch thinks that the effects might last for almost a month.\'

*That's nothing. The girl will be fine.*

\'So?\' Harry tilted her chin up with his fingertip and held her gaze. \'You told me you didn't care what I did so long as I was yours, Fleur. I feel the same.\'

\'I am in a lot of trouble,\' she whispered. \'The school has suspended me. I can take my exams, but if I fail I can\'t return and do them at the same time as everyone else. They wrote to my parents, too.\'

\'You won\'t fail.' Harry held her close. 'You *never* fail.'

\'But my parents, they will be angry with you for being the reason I did it.' Fleur buried her face in his neck. 'I'm sorry. I made things even harder for you.'

\'I quite like that you wanted to defend me.' He kissed her on the top of the head. 'And someone once told me that the more it hurts to get something, the more satisfying getting it is.'

She huffed. 'Well, at least you're listening to someone smarter than yourself.' She sighed and wrapped his arms around her. 'I was going to ask you to come here for Christmas. I was really looking forward to you being around all the time, but now...\'

\'If you want me here and I'm allowed to stay, then I'll come,' Harry murmured. 'I can ignore anything I have to.'

Fleur's fingers tightened in his robes. 'Merci, monCœur.'

He gave her a little squeeze and held her tight. Faint, sweet marzipan drifted to his nose and the heat of her melted into him.

Fleur leant her head back. \'Why did you want to speak with

me?\'

He smiled. 'I just have a question. What do you know about Les Inconnus?'

Fleur's brow creased. \'A little. It's a secret what they actually do, but most people know about the general fields, the mysteries are famous.\'

\'Oh?\' Harry bumped her nose with his. 'Care to share?'

\'Les Inconnus work at the Bureau d\'Énigmes. It was created by an English wizard who came to France after marrying a French witch. He designed the Bureau d\'Énigmes based on your Department of Mysteries. Why do you want to know?\'

\'Are there prophecies in the Bureau d\'Énigmes?\' Harry

asked.

\'Yes. The witnesses of the prediction are obligated to leave

a memory in the bureau, there's some spell that notifies them if a prophecy is made. I've no idea how *that* works. Some kind of trace on those capable, perhaps. There're only prophecies about French wizards and witches there, though. The Bureau d\'Énigmes has no authority to keep any others.\'

\'But if there are prophecies in the Bureau d\'Énigmes, then there are likely ones in the Department of Mysteries as well,\' Harry murmured.

Fleur narrowed her eyes. \'Why're you interested?\'

\'When I escaped from Voldemort, I surprised him with how much stronger I'd grown since our last encounter. He mentioned a prophecy and implied that it was about, or at least mentioned, me.\'

\'You want to hear it,\' Fleur said. \'Why not ask? You're legally entitled to listen to a prophecy that is relevant to you in France, I\'m sure it's the same in Britain.\'

\'The Ministry would never allow me to view a prophecy that's connected with Voldemort, not when they\'re doing everything they can to cover his return up.\'

*I'll have to take it myself.*

Fleur's eyes darkened a touch. \'Tell me you're not planning

to steal it.'

'I don't want to lie to you,\' Harry whispered. 'I *need* to know

what it says. Voldemort knows.'

\'How would you even get in?\' Her eyes shifted to midnight blue and small white tufts slipped from the skin on the back of her neck. 'How would you get *out?!*'

\'I don\'t know.\' Harry shrugged. \'I only learnt about the Department of Mysteries today. I might be able to get my godfather to help. He and the rest of Albus Dumbledore\'s followers are secretly guarding the department, though whether it's the prophecy or something else, I don\'t know.\'

\'Don\'t rush in and do something reckless,\' Fleur hissed. \'I will *not* have you die, or get sent to Azkaban because you wanted to hear some prophecy that might not even help you.\'

A ball of emotion stuck in Harry's throat. 'I'll be careful, I promise. There's no point winning anything if it loses me you. That's -- that's just not winning anymore.'

\'And you'll tell me what it says.' Fleur's eyes faded to summer blue and the feather tips slid back beneath her skin. \'I can\'t help you if you keep me in the dark.\'

Harry grinned and eyed her up. \'The dark's the *last* place

you should be.'

Pink blossomed on Fleur's cheeks. 'Are you sure, monCœur?\' She snared his fingers in hers and drew them down to her waist, then up until his knuckles grazed her breasts. \'There are all *sorts* of things we could do in the dark.\'

Heat flashed to his face and his breath shook. The gentle, pale curve of Fleur's cleavage hovered in his thoughts, mixed with her sugar-glazed lips from the Yule Ball, the pink tip of her tongue and the flash of her white teeth when she laughed, the smouldering fire in her eyes when he kissed her hard. His blood rushed south.

\'You didn\'t answer, monCœur.\' Fleur\'s fingers trailed down his back, her left hand traced a dangerous path across his stomach and up inside his robes onto his chest.

Her lips crushed against his. Harry dropped his hands to her waist and pulled her tight against him. She moaned and pushed him back, trapping his thigh between hers, and slipping her tongue past Harry's lips. The taste of light, sweet, marzipan melted on his lips as she traced them with the tip of her tongue. He slid a hand through the buttons of her blouse and drew gentle circles across the smooth heat of her stomach. His thumb brushed the hem of her underwear.

Fleur quivered and caught his hand under hers. Desire blazed in her blue eyes. 'Keep doing that and you'll need to give me more than just kisses, monCœur.'

Harry's heart raced and he slid his thumb a little lower, slipping it under the hem of her underwear, still drawing light circles on her smooth skin.

Her fingers trapped his. 'Harry,' she whispered. 'I *mean* it.'

He swallowed and slid his thumb a fraction further down.

'So stop me.'

Fleur's lips brushed his neck and her breath washed over his

skin. Her fingers vanished. 'Go lower,' she murmured.

# Peacock Hunting

Dusk hung over the neat lawns and tall, trimmed hedges; soft half-light settled over Malfoy's manor and grounds with a cool mist. Faint birdsong chorused from all around and distant stars flickered against a moonless backdrop of deepest velvet.

'Boring.' Bella kicked her bare feet through the dew-laden grass between the neat topiary and the white roses. She swung her boots back and forth in her hand, batting at a patch of geraniums. 'Boring. Boring. *Boring*.'

White petals drifted down into the dew. Bella squished them into the grass with her toes.

*Find something to do, Bella.* She huffed and brushed her curls back over her shoulders. *But there's nothing to do in baby Cissy's silly cage, Bell.*

A peacock cried from the other side of the hedge.

Bella giggled. 'One of Cissy's silly birds.'

*Let's grab it, Bell.*

She crept along the line of the hedge, sticking to the shadow and tiptoeing past marble busts. In the deep shade, the grass turned ice cold on her toes. A second cry echoed past the last pale stone statue.

*It'll see us, Bella!* She plucked her wand out and disillusioned herself. *Not anymore, Bell.*

A shimmer padded through the grass where her feet had

been as she slipped 'round the bust and corner of the hedge. Cool

grass tickled her toes. The breeze flattened her dress against her skin, sending little ripples down the silk. A large, white bird strutted along the edge of a small pond, bobbing its head.

Bella giggled and prowled a couple of steps closer. *I'm*

*gonna get you birdy!*

A blur lunged from the base of the hedge past Bella's feet.

Nagini seized the peacock by the neck with its fangs; its white wings beat against smooth, dark scales. The peacock screamed, then shuddered and fell still. Nagini dragged the bird into the long grass and unhinged her jaw, swallowing the peacock a few inches at a time.

'Silly birds.' Bella dispelled her charm. 'Pretty and stupid and easy prey.'

A small, dark bird fluttered down from the dusk and alighted on Bella's hand. It spilt into ink upon her palm and twisted into words.

'Number five, Church Road, Hasketon, Woodbridge.' Bella giggled. 'Found you, Andi!'

*A useful muggle, Bella.* She pouted. *Even boring cattle have uses from time to time, Bell.*

The ink seeped into her skin. A red-tiled, flint-walled, round- towered church and a neat row of houses behind a green common and scattered trees flashed through her mind.

*More than enough to apparate to.*

Bella smiled and bounced on her feet. 'Now, I'll make you come back to baby Cissy and I.' She pictured the image the ink raven had given her and apparated.

A small, neat house with a white fence, door, and windows sat midway in an identical row. Striped grass flanked a small stone path and above the black letter five on the door swung a small raven wind-chime.

'Andi!' Bella darted across the grass.

*Don't let anyone see us, Bella.* She froze and ducked behind the hedge. *Why not? Andi'll be happy to see us! She's our sister.*

Bella frowned. 'But Cissy did say she was being silly, marrying a mudblood and living in the muggle world. She might refuse to talk to us.'

She peered through the hedge and into the window. A tall man stood with his back to her. A slim, pale pair of arms wrapped 'round his chest and dark curls hung past his right shoulder.

*Andi!* Bella edged closer. A little fire bubbled up in her blood at the way those small fingers clung to the mudblood. *Time to come back and be a weird sister with us again, Andi. We need to cheer up itty bitty baby Cissy and make her fun again.*

Her forearm burnt and stung. She huffed and tugged her indigo sleeve back. The serpent writhed around the skull beneath her skin.

'Aww[www.](http://www/)' Bella hurled her boots into the hedge and watched them bounce back across the grass. 'I wanted to see *Andi*.'

*We can wait, Bell.* She stomped across and shoved her feet into her boots. *We already waited for fifteen years, Bella.*

Bella cocked her head and dried her feet with a flick of her

wand. 'I guess we can wait a few days longer, Bell.'

She apparated back into the main hall of the mansion.

The Dark Lord stood in the faint light of the oculus. A silhouette of dark silk framed the soft glow of slitted, crimson eyes. Malfoy, Rookwood, and Strange Boy knelt in the shadows around him, their shining silver masks in their hands.

'Bella.' The Dark Lord crooked a finger. 'You're late.' 'Sorry.' She skipped across to join them. 'I was watching

Nagini eat a peacock.'

A quiet groan slipped through Malfoy's lips.

She giggled. 'Cissy's not very happy the snake keeps eating her pretty pets.'

The Dark Lord's lips twitched. 'I'm sure Lucius can procure more peacocks, his fortune has grown great while others languished in Azkaban\...' He waved a hand. The air shimmered, and the other three were drawn upright. 'Now. You have been making plans, Lucius.'

'Of course, my lord.' Malfoy dipped his head. 'I've bribed an

official to let myself and Bellatrix--' 'Just Bella!'

The Dark Lord tutted and his crimson eyes flicked up to Bella's. A faint, dry heat washed over them. 'Hush, Bella. I wish to hear Lucius' plan *uninterrupted.*'

Strange Boy sidled a little closer, shaking his head.

*What does he want?* Bella gave him a shrug. *Oh well, Bell.*

Malfoy swallowed. 'Severus informed me that Dumbledore's sycophants are spread thin and tied down. The official I bribed will be absent from the atrium, so we'll be able to descend straight down to the entrance to the Department of Mysteries unimpeded.'

'Adequate.' The Dark Lord turned to Rookwood. 'I will inspect the doorway myself in the coming days. Should it prove necessary, I will send you along with Bella and Lucius to remove any key wards.' He raised a long, pale finger when Rookwood opened his mouth. 'That's all, Augustus. You may leave.'

'Yes, my lord.' Rookwood bowed and scrambled out.

The Dark Lord extended a black-sleeved arm at Strange

Boy. 'You as well.'

Strange Boy shot a look at Bella, then bowed and retreated

back into the gloom of the mansion's corridors.

'The next step, Lucius.' The Dark Lord stared up through the oculus at the stars. 'I trust that there is one.'

'Of course, my lord.' Malfoy tugged at the collar of his robes. A faint sheen of sweat gleamed at his temples. 'Once the key wards on the door are removed, my lord, either one of us can use fiendfyre to enter. We merely have to make sure Dumbledore's guard is taken care of first.'

A little thrill swept through Bella and she beamed. 'Fun.

Fun. Fun.'

'Yes, Bella.' The Dark Lord's lips curled into a thin smile. 'A little game for you.'

*Win or die, Bella.* She curled her fingers round her wand.

*Feel alive, or lose, Bell.*

Malfoy shifted his feet. 'Once we're inside, my lord. Is there

anything you wish from us?'

The Dark Lord contemplated Malfoy like a viper studying a mouse. 'Yes. Once you've cleared the entrance, you must find the Hall of Prophecies. Ensure there's nothing untoward lurking there, Dumbledore would love to trap me for the world to see and undo the progress we've made in the shadows.' His wand slipped from his sleeve. The tip hovered before Malfoy's eyes. 'Do not fail me, Lucius. Or there will be *consequences*.'

'I would never, my lord.'

The Dark Lord's wand vanished. 'Then you also may leave.' Bella cocked her head. 'And what about me?'

'Bella.' The Dark Lord's crimson gaze swept over her. 'You've not been taking the potions Severus prepared for you. Word has reached me you... *refused*.'

*Stupid Strange Boy tattled!* Bella balled her hands into fists.

*I hate those silly, lumpy, bitter drinks.*

She screwed up her face. 'They taste icky.'

'They're good for you.' The Dark Lord raised his hand. 'You will take them, Bella. If you don't, you will spend your time here rather than playing with my opponents.'

Bella pouted and buried the brief heat that bubbled up in

her blood. 'Fine. I'll take them.'

'I suspect there's a good chance Dumbledore will attempt to trap me into a confrontation at the Ministry.' The Dark Lord's red eyes gleamed bright. 'He knows if the truth is not revealed soon, it will be too late to stop me...'

*It's already too late, Bella. Dumbledore's all old.* Bella giggled. *His game's nearly over anyway, Bell.*

'You want me to play with him instead?' she asked.

'No,' the Dark Lord whispered. 'When the path is clear, you will use the mark I gave you to notify me. I will slip in undetected and retrieve the prophecy myself. No other can remove it save Harry Potter himself and I doubt Dumbledore will risk his most valuable pawn being lost to the Ministry's justice.' He steepled his long fingers. 'Should there be any other unwelcome guests, you're to kill them, *all of them*, save for Dumbledore himself. If the old fool arrives, you're to get yourself out by any means you can. Leave Lucius if necessary.'

*But imagine what a great game that would be, Bell. The pain, the struggle, then sweet victory.* She stifled a small sigh. *But he won't let us, Bella. He wants to play that game himself.*

Disappointment ate at Bella. '[Aw](http://www/)w[w.](http://www/)'

The Dark Lord's lips curved into a cold grin. 'I know you wish to play with the old teacher, but I don't intend to risk losing such a valuable follower as you.' The slight smile faded. 'Now, there's another matter I wish to discuss with you, Bella.'

'Oh?' Bella bounced on her heels. 'A game?'

'Someone cast the Dark Mark at Godric's Hollow.' The Dark Lord's crimson eyes burnt with fury. 'I have allowed my followers to believe it was myself, but one of my inner circle is to blame. They've

either shared the spell I created for them, or risked exposing us

before I have commanded it.'

'Who was it?' A brief, cool rush coursed through her veins.

Bella licked her lips. 'Can I play with them?'

'Only if they're proven guilty or it happens again.' The Dark Lord reached out and caught her shoulder. His fingers were cold as the scales of a snake and so tight they dug into her skin. 'Keep an eye on Lucius. He has the most to lose of those who follow me. If it's truly a betrayal, it's most likely to come from Lucius hoping to cast me down before any conflict arises to cost him his influence or riches.'

'Cissy will be upset if I beat Lucius.' She shrugged. 'But he's made her sad, so maybe beating him will cheer her up. She can buy her own peacocks, then!'

'Perhaps.' The Dark Lord's lips curved into a thin smile. 'Keep your eyes open for whomever's responsible, Bella. The longer we can move in the shadows, the easier our victory will be.'

'Is that it?' Bella swayed back and forth on the spot. 'When are we going to the Department of Mysteries?'

'Lucius has chosen a date.' The Dark Lord's red eyes met hers. 'You won't be doing anything other than recovering, Bella. I will summon you when it's time.'

*Nope.* A little smile crept onto Bella's lips. *We're going to*

*find Andi and bring her back to us, Bell. Sisters are forever.*

She giggled. 'Of course.'

'Good.' The Dark Lord's whisper came soft as the brush of his silk robes across the marble floor. 'I would be *displeased* if I learnt

you risked my venture for some childish whim, Bella. *Very displeased.*' He vanished with a soft snap.

Bella stuck her tongue out at where he'd stood. *He's more*

*boring than he used to be, Bell.*

'But he's the best player.' She tapped her heel on the marble and listened to the click echo back off the empty walls. 'So he makes the rules, Bella.'

*Until another player comes to beat him, Bell.* She fingered her wand. A faint thrill coursed through her veins. *Everyone loses in the end, Bella.*

Bella nodded. 'Even us, Bell.'

The room echoed the words back at her as she stood alone beneath the glass dome.

*Even us, Bella.*

# Unexpected Patronum

Colin Creevey dozed beside the fire in the common room.

His heavy, steady breathing rose and fell in a regular rhythm over the rattling window beside the stairs. Creevey's head slipped off the corner of his chair and he jolted upright.

Harry caught his eye and pushed a whisper of magic at him, a faint impression of fading shock flitting through his thoughts. He turned to the fire and the tenuous connection broke.

*Getting there.*

\'You\'re not looking very ill.\' Katie drifted down the staircase from the girl's dormitories and sat on the arm of Harry\'s chair. \'That horrible sickness you picked up yesterday has mysteriously vanished.\'

Harry smiled. \'I found a cure.'

*Fleur.* The fire that'd smouldered in her eyes flitted through his thoughts and his heart squirmed. *Always Fleur.*

\'Was it Frenchie medicine?\' Katie waggled her eyebrows.

'No.\' Heat crept onto Harry's face and he tried to smother the memories of Fleur's little gasps and moans beneath the willow tree.

Katie pursed her lips. '*Sure,* Harry*.Whatever* you say.*'* She wriggled further into the arm of his chair and rested her arm on his shoulder. 'I went to the hospital wing when Neville said you were sick, but you weren\'t there and nobody had seen you since your lesson with McGonagall...'

\'I might've gotten lost on the route to the hospital wing,\'

Harry admitted.

'Just be careful about getting caught disappearing off to France. Rita Skeeter hasn\'t written anything about you in almost a week, she\'s probably desperate for another.\' Katie gave him a gentle shove and lowered her voice. 'How's it going with you and Frenchie, anyway? You never say anything about her.'

*Because when people realise I have things, they always try to take them away.*

'I don't want anyone going after her because of me, *especially* Skeeter. Any girl she thinks is anywhere close to me is going to be on the front page by the next day.'

Katie nodded. 'That must suck. If you're not telling people, she must still get hit on an awful lot. You'll both probably have to go on some fake dates at some point or people will start to think it's weird.'

Harry smothered a twist of ugly heat and forced a smile. 'She's suspended for cursing someone right now, so I doubt anyone's hitting on her.'

'That's good.'

'Yeah.' Harry crushed the shadow beside Fleur down somewhere he could no longer see it. 'Can't say I'd be all that happy with that.'

'At least you're not around to see it happening.' Katie tugged at her hair. 'Still, as long as the two of you are happy and safe, right?'

'Right.'

She squirmed on the arm of his chair. \'Since you were away, did you happen to read what Skeeter wrote in the absence of a story about you or Dumbledore?

\'No.\' He glanced up and met her eyes. 'Anything interesting?'

*Any Dark Marks? Or did they manage to cover it up completely?*

\'Someone cast the Dark Mark over Godric\'s Hollow.\' Katie lowered her voice to a whisper. \'The Ministry are quoted as blaming Sirius Black because he's an escaped supporter of You-Know-Who, but Skeeter went a bit off the script after that point. She mentioned Black was last reported in Cyprus only three days ago and that he never cast the Dark Mark after killing Peter Pettigrew.\'

\'Just enough to inspire doubt about the story.' Harry frowned. 'Maybe someone at the Ministry upset her and this is the only way she can get back at them.\'

*Maybe Fudge forgot to keep paying her or something.*

\'Or she might just want more money,\' Katie muttered. \'The interesting thing is that the Prophet got into trouble for revealing the details of a secret investigation, so Skeeter shouldn\'t have known about the Cyprus thing at all.\'

Harry laughed. \'I don\'t think she should know a lot of things that she writes. She must know someone in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.\'

\'She *is* very good at finding out secrets, isn\'t she? I wonder how she does it.\'

\'What else did the article say?\'

\'Not a great deal, it was only part of her column. There was a bit on the Dark Mark, that it\'s He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\'s personal symbol and only cast by members of his inner circle, some of whom have escaped from Azkaban.\' She rubbed her chin, then slipped off the arm of the chair and wormed her way in beside Harry. \'She speculated about why the mark might have been cast over Godric\'s Hollow, too.\'

\'My parents.'

\'The Daily Prophet suggests it was Black taking credit for their deaths.\'

\'I suspect they\'ll never actually catch them, Sirius Black or not. They didn\'t manage to keep him in Azkaban and they haven\'t found him in two years.\'

\'You don\'t seem all that concerned by it,\' Katie said. \'The Dark Mark was cast over your *parents'house*.\'

\'They died when I was a baby, Katie, and everyone knows who killed them. The house is just a memorial, I\'ve never set foot inside it. There isn\'t really a good reason for me to care. I\'d rather they were casting big obvious pieces of magic in the sky than murdering people.\'

\'Maybe they\'re only just getting started.'

*Well, the more times I cast it, the harder it'll be to ignore.*

\'Maybe they are,' he said.

\'Enough gloomy talk.\' Katie gestured at the handful of people who were making their way out through the portrait. 'It's DA time.'

floor.

\'Have fun.\' Harry pushed her out of his chair and onto the

\'Oh no you don\'t, Harry.\' Katie pouted up at him from the

floor. \'You promised you were coming to this one.\'

*The Patronus. Right.*

\'I did, didn\'t I? Might as well get it over and done with then.\'

He dragged himself out of his chair, offering Katie a hand.

She laughed and let him pull her to her feet. \'Such a gentleman.' She leant in close. 'No wonder Frenchie's so smitten. What other boy could hope to compete?'

*Probably an awful lot of them.* A little ball of cold tightened beneath his ribs. *But Fleur would never want any of them. They're not right for her.*

He managed a chuckle. \'I *do* try.\'

Katie shoved him toward the portrait and out onto the stairs.

'Come on, lover boy. You can daydream later.'

\'Harry.\' Ginny\'s voice came from right next to his ear.

He winced as cold shock flooded through his veins. \'Ginny?\'

She twisted her fingers together and stared at her feet, then took a deep breath and straightened up. \'I was wondering about something---'

Katie stepped out of the passage into Harry's back. \'Ow.'

\'I was wondering if you wanted to go to Hogsmeade next weekend,\' Ginny blurted.

Harry grimaced. 'I\'m sorry, Ginny, I can\'t.\'

\'You *can\'t* or you don\'t *want* to?\' Ginny asked.

\'Both, I guess.' He sighed. 'I don\'t want to upset you, Ginny, but I just don't see you like that and I don't think that's going to change.\'

Katie.

\'Then why *can\'t* you go?\' Ginny threw a glance past him at

*Merde.* Harry struggled for something plausible. \'He\'s busy,\' Katie said.

\'Oh.\' Ginny glanced between them. \'I see. I just had to ask,

Harry. I promised myself that I\'d ask one more time and if you said no, then I\'d move on for good.\'

Harry watched a blue beetle crawling along Ginny's shoulder. 'I *am* sorry, Ginny. I don't think you'd enjoy dating me right now, anyway.'

*Not least because Fleur would murder both of us.*

\'There're plenty of other guys who'd be lucky to be with you,\' Katie added.

Ginny's eyes flashed. \'Just not the one I want. I\'ll see you at the meeting, Harry.' She turned on her heel and stalked away.

The blue beetle drifted off her shoulder and away down the staircase.

\'That could have gone worse,\' Harry muttered. 'I kind of thought she was over her infatuation with heroes though.'

\'It could have gone better too,\' Katie murmured. \'Did you see how she looked at us?\'

Harry raised an eyebrow. 'With her eyes?'

\'She thinks the reason you can\'t go with her is *me*,\' Katie

said.

\'Oh.'

\'Exactly.'

\'Do you think she\'ll tell anyone?\' Harry asked.

\'Will she talk to her friends about why she\'s upset over you

turning her down?\' Katie shook her head. 'Sometimes, Harry, you're very perceptive, but other times I wonder if you understand girls at all.'

'I don't.' Harry grinned at her. 'You're all weird.'

'Tell that to Frenchie,' she sniped. 'And speaking of...'

Harry's heart sank. 'If Ginny tells people, everyone will start believing it.'

*Fleur may kill me.*

'Do you think anyone will believe it?' he asked.

Pink crept onto Katie's cheeks. 'Well, not to put too fine a point on it, Harry, but we *are* close friends and we *do* have a little bit of history.'

'Merde.'

*Fleur will definitely kill me if she learns everyone thinks I'm*

*dating Katie.*

'[Aw](http://www/)w[w.](http://www/)' Katie patted him on the cheek. 'You've started picking up cute Frenchie words.'

'That's not a very cute word.' He scowled and hurried up the stairs. 'I'll have to tell Ginny we're not a thing at the DA before she talks to anyone.'

'You aren\'t going to tell her about Frenchie, are you?\' Katie bounced after him and caught his wrist. 'I thought you were keeping her a secret.'

\'I won\'t tell anyone about Fleur who doesn\'t already know. If she asks, I guess I just won\'t answer.\'

\'She won\'t believe you.\' Katie caught his eye and shrugged.

'I wouldn't. It sounds fishy.'

\'It\'s Fleur hearing about it that concerns me. Ginny will get

over it.\'

Her fingers slipped from his arm. \'Right. Of course.' She

glanced away. 'You could always swear an unbreakable vow to Frenchie that we're just friends. It's not like we're actually *doing* anything.'

Harry contemplated it. \'It's dangerous, but I suppose I'd

rather do that than have her misunderstand and leave.\'

\'You\'d rather permanently bind your life and magic to her than have her upset at you?\' Katie stared at him. 'That's *very* committed, Harry.'

He flushed and stepped toward the door on the seventh

floor. 'Hush, you.'

'You're so sweet.\' Katie giggled. \'Clearly I\'m a lucky girl.' 'As if I'd date a violent Quidditch fanatic like you again.\'

She pouted at him. \'We both know you'd be more than happy to see me in that seashell bra.\' A little gleam welled up in her eyes. 'Or *not* in the seashell bra.'

Harry paused with one hand on the door. 'We should

probably not make jokes like that for a bit.'

Katie's lips twisted. 'Fine. I'll hold back when there are gullible idiots nearby.'

Harry offered her a smile. 'Thanks, Katie. You can still make as many silly jokes about us as you like when there's nobody listening.' He pushed the door open.

'I'll hold you to that,' Katie murmured in his ear.

\'Ah, the teacher arrives.' Cedric waved everyone else back against the wall with his wand. 'Neville was beginning to fear you weren't coming.'

\'I promised I would,\' Harry said.

The members of the DA watched him with wary eyes. Hermione rocked back and forth on her heels, tapping her wand against her palm.

'Alright, let's just get on with it, then.\' Harry strode forward into the middle of the room. 'The Patronus Charm is more advanced than anything else you'll likely be learning at Hogwarts in Defence. It creates a partially tangible form of positive emotion and intent. The

steps are relatively simple, you need only focus on a positive emotion and speak the incantation, but having the ability to cast it is another thing entirely.\'

Harry spread his hands to indicate they should move apart from each other. \'Can anyone produce a Patronus of any sort?\' He glanced at Cedric.

\'Nope.\' Cedric shook his head. \'If I knew how you wouldn\'t have nearly died when dementors interrupted our Quidditch game in third---\'

\'I can!\' Hermione jumped forward. \'It\'s not a proper one like yours, but I *can* cast it.\'

Harry stifled the urge to roll his eyes. \'Show everyone.'

Hermione raised her wand, glowing pink with pride, and

closed her eyes. \'ExpectoPatronum.'

A rush of silver vapour shot from her wand to form a shining shield between her and Harry.

\'That\'s very impressive,\' Harry said. \'Self-taught, I presume.\'

\'Yes.'

\'How long have you been trying? All the way since the end of third year, when you realised I could do it?\'

She flushed and shuffled her feet. 'Yes. Sorry, Harry.'

\'You heard the incantation,\' Harry said. \'Hermione pronounced it perfectly. Focus on the happiest memory you have, or imagine something that will make you happier still, then cast.\'

\'Which do you use?\' Ginny asked.

\'Whichever comes easiest,\' Harry lied.

*I've not tried. Not since the maze.*

\'Can you show us yours?\' Cedric asked.

*Merde.*

He pictured his parents in the Mirror of Erised, but Fleur's figure crept in between them in the ancient, silver surface. \'ExpectoPatronum.'

A bright cloud of silver vapour burst from its tip, hovering in the air in front of him. The vapour twisted and churned on itself like smoke caught on the wind.

\'I thought you said you could form a *corporeal* Patronus,\' Smith said.

\'He can,\' Ron said. \'We all saw it at Quidditch in our third year when Malfoy tried to pretend to be a dementor.\'

\'Stags don\'t have feathers,\' Terry Boot called out.

Harry\'s gaze snapped back to the mist. The tips of ghost-like feathers shivered at the edges of the vapour, flaring as if to catch the wind. *Best not to let them see what form it has.* He dispelled it.

\'A Patronus takes on a corporeal form that is unique to the caster,\' Hermione recited. \'A corporeal Patronus generally takes the shape of the animal the caster shares the deepest affinity with.\'

\'He probably doesn\'t want us to see what it is,\' Smith sneered. \'It\'s likely a snake.\'

\'With *feathers?*\' Terry Boot shot Smith a scathing look.

Smith muttered something under his breath and shuffled back into the crowd.

\'It\'s changed...\' Hermione stared at Harry. \'A corporeal Patronus only changes when the caster has been through a dramatic, emotional upheaval. The book said things like loss, love, and betrayal have caused changes in Patronuses.\'

*Thanks, Hermione.*

\'Perhaps you should all try casting your own versions now.' Harry slipped his wand back up his sleeve. 'As entertaining as listening to Hermione's audio version of the textbook is, you're here to learn how to cast it, not guess which feathered creature mine is. The dementors are unlikely to be stopped from taking your souls because you know the form of my Patronus.'

The members of the DA split up and began to cast. A few wisps of silver shot from a scattered handful of wands to disperse into the air.

\'Pick your happiest memory and let yourself really feel it.' Harry took a seat on the floor nearby Nev and Katie. 'Or if that doesn\'t work, imagine something that *would* make you happy and use that.'

Katie shot Harry a glance, then closed her eyes and returned to casting. Silver mist gushed from her wand, growing tight and dense a metre from its tip.

Harry watched it coalesce into the form of a crow.

She pouted. \'Well that wasn\'t what I was expecting.'

Fred laughed and pointed it out to his twin. \'But it explains a

lot---\'

\'Oh great Dark Mistress,\' George said.

\'Well done for being the first.' Harry surveyed the room. \'Cedric, Hermione, and Neville look like they\'re getting fairly close now, too.\'

A silver badger formed from Cedric's wand and patrolled a

small circle around his feet.

He shot Harry a rueful grin. \'It was inevitable that it'd be a

badger, wasn\'t it?\'

'Badgers are actually violent, vicious creatures.' Harry eyed

the silver patronus. 'Yours looks like a spaniel in cosplay.'

'Bit harsh.' Cedric laughed. 'But probably fair. They

absolutely *ravage* Dad's lawn. Worse than gnomes, apparently.'

A silver otter chattered and scampered around Hermione's

feet.

*Appropriate enough. I knew she'd get it soon.* A faint pang

rippled through Harry's chest as he drew Ginny aside.

A little flicker of something that might've been hope passed through her eyes. 'Harry?'

'I'm not with Katie.' He swallowed a bitter lump. 'I'm not -- I'm not with anyone. I just don't want to have to listen to all the rumours. Katie doesn't need that.'

\'Is she why your Patronus changed? From before the Yule

Ball?'

\'I don\'t think so.\' Harry shrugged. 'I felt like a lot of people

turned on me, then. Loss and betrayal.'

\'Not *love*, then,\' Ginny murmured.

*Almost certainly.* Harry smothered a small smile. Fleur's blue eyes and slight pout hovered in his thoughts, and a soft pain twisted beneath his ribs. *And I'm stuck here instead of being with her.*

\'Definitely not,\' he said.

\'I wasn\'t going to tell anyone,\' Ginny said. \'I might've told my friends that I thought you were with someone else, but I thought you and Katie were trying to keep it a secret and just act like you were friends.\'

\'We *are* just friends.'

Ginny glanced past his shoulder. 'I think she knows what

we\'re talking about. I should keep practising.\'

Harry caught Katie's eye. She beamed and gave him a thumbs up. Behind her, a gleaming silver wolf padded around Neville, nuzzling at his wand hand with its muzzle.

*Interesting.* Harry waved to Katie and drifted away toward the door and the chamber. *I wonder what mine is.*

\'Myrtle?\' He paused before the puddle.

\'Harry!\' She shot out of the wall and twirled on the spot. \'I had visitors at lunchtime yesterday. First years, or maybe second, they were very *small*. They wanted to know if there was anything special about the bathroom.\'

\'Did they decide on anything?\' A tight knot coiled in his

stomach.

*If they keep coming back, I might not be able to get out to*

*see Fleur.*

does.\'

\'They never found anything, but nobody who comes here

\'If they come back, please tell me, Myrtle,\' Harry asked. \'You

don\'t know how important it is to me that the entrance remains a secret.\'

\'I\'ll tell you, Harry. I always know when someone\'s in here. I can *feel* it.\'

\'Thanks.\' He shot her a smile. 'I appreciate it Myrtle.' 'That's okay, Harry.' She fiddled with her wide-framed

glasses. 'Come visit me whenever you want.'

'I'll do my best to say hi.' Harry turned to the sink. '*Open*.' He hurried down the steps and through to the top of the bridge. \'Mother, I\'m home,\' he called.

\'Welcome back, *darling*.\' Salazar pried his snake off his forehead. 'Are you here to learn something useful, or are you off to France again?'

\'I was wondering what you knew about the Patronus Charm? Mine appears to have changed.\'

Salazar peered down at him. \'Changed?\'

\'It used to be a stag, then I was almost unable to cast it, and now it seems to be something feathered, though I haven't cast a complete corporeal charm yet.\'

\'That\'s interesting. The charm's very old, it\'s one of the obvious, emotion-related concepts of magic, but very hard to produce despite it. My own Patronus changed form twice, for different reasons.\'

*Interesting. I wonder if there are any similarities.*

\'When did it change?\' Harry asked.

\'If you wanted to know why you could've just asked,' Salazar said. \'It was originally a regular serpent, but when I met my wife and we had our daughter, it changed and became a runespoor. I was very proud of it.\' His expression darkened. \'After my wife\'s death and the beginning of my quest to try and undo the sacrifice I made, it changed again, shifting to the form of a moth. It remained a moth until I stopped being able to cast it.\'

\'You stopped being able to cast it?\'

\'You said you were almost unable to cast it, when was that?\'

\'In the maze during the third task.' Harry thought back. 'It wasn't the best time for me, not much was going well. Even happy memories and thoughts didn't really reach me.\'

\'Then you already know why.\' Salazar's smile was thin and bitter. \'I told you that those who commit themselves to escaping death are consumed by their quest. By the end of my life everything else had lost meaning and I'd all but given up. My happiest memories were tainted.\'

'I see.'

\'You have Fleur Delacour now, so cast the charm and show

me.\'

Harry closed his eyes. He reached back for the warmth of

the sun through the willow leaves, the quiet sound of the river and the wind in the grass, the sweet scent of marzipan, the taste of Fleur's lips, the blue of her eyes, the silver of her hair, the slight curve

of her pout, and the softness in her eyes when she stared at him.

*Perfect. As she always is.*

\'ExpectoPatronum,\' he murmured.

Heat rushed up his arm from his wand and a great eagle burst forth in an explosion of silver vapour. It spread its wings wide and eyed Harry's surroundings with fierce intelligence.

\'An eagle...'

\'That\'s not an eagle, Harry.\' Salazar's green eyes softened and the corner of his mouth crooked. \'That is an Anzu, a giant bird supposedly capable of magically breathing fire. They went extinct millennia ago and are only found in the oldest stories of Mesopotamia, their homeland.\'

\'An extinct, fire-breathing eagle.\' Harry grinned. \'I like it.\'

'A new Patronus with the form of an ancient Mesopotamian magical bird... Do you know where the first veela are supposed to have come from? I don\'t think it\'s any mystery what caused this change.\'

Fleur?\'

\'I like my eagle. Is that *really* why it\'s that form? Because of

\'It\'s an Anzu. Most eagles would disappear under its wings.

And it seems that way. Mine changed because I found my wife, then when I lost her. Helga\'s never changed from a phoenix, Rowena\'s was always an owl, and Godric\'spatronus was a gryphon for as long as I knew him, but he mentioned it changed when his parents died.\'

\'It\'s actually that large in real life?\' Harry stared at the wingspan for a moment. \'You know, I sort of expected the other founders\' Patronuses to be the same as the house sigils.\'

\'They were extinct long before I was alive.\' Salazar shrugged, displacing his snake. \'But the corporeal form of your Patronus takes on the exact shape of the animal as far as I understand, so probably.\' He peered down at Harry as he picked his serpent back up. \'And why would you assume we would give away so much information about ourselves when choosing house sigils? Rowena chose a bird famous for its intelligence, I chose the serpent because nobody would expect anything else from me, Godric wanted to choose a gryphon, but I told him that would look vain, so he chose half a gryphon instead, and Helga just liked badgers. She thought they were adorable.\'

Harry sighed. \'That completely ruins my image of the four of

you being the perfect embodiment of your houses' traits.'

\'Rowena\'s is fairly accurate,\' Salazar said. \'Mine, too. Godric would've hated the students in his house, if what I\'ve heard from you is true. He valued bravery, loyalty, and forgiveness above all else.\'

\'What about Helga?\'

\'She loved children. Helga spoiled every child she met, her nephews and nieces adored her more than they did their parents. It wouldn\'t matter which house you were in to her as long as she could mother you.\'

\'I wonder how Slytherin ended up having such a bad

reputation.'

Salazar let out a short, bitter laugh. \'The blame lies partly with myself and partly with the traits I valued. Ambition, cunning, intelligence and bravery can all be used to do terrible things, but while bravery can be foolish and intelligence misapplied, cunning can only really be outdone by others. It did not help that I dabbled greatly in dangerous magic in the final years of my life. That would have

attracted a great many wizards and witches of questionable morals to my house.\'

\'Like Tom,\' Harry muttered.

\'He was nearly sorted into both Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, actually. His ambition outweighed his desire for knowledge and the loyalty he felt toward a world that accepted him when his did not, but only just.\'

A strange sort of sadness settled over Harry like a thick, soft blanket. \'If only the magical world hadn't turned its back on him like the muggle one.'

\'If he'd chosen either of Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff it might not have done, but his desire was too strong and he did. There's little point regretting it now. I watched him change from Tom to Voldemort with pride and said nothing, not realising how much he'd lost from himself in his becoming until it was too late.\'

\'Could you have stopped him before he changed too much?\' Harry picked the time-turner off the desk and tugged a thick tome on prophecies off the shelf behind him. 'If you'd known, that is.'

\'I believe so.\' Salazar stared down at Harry. Shadows

clustered in the portrait's eyes, deep and dark as dusk. \'I hope so.\'

# Family Matters

Shadows swirled between pale, crumbling headstones.

Thick fog rose around his knees like smoke. Harry drifted past rows of dark-lettered tombs toward distant, flickering light.

*James Potter. Lily Potter. Quirrell.* Harry trailed his fingers along the smooth, cold marble as the fog closed around him. *Barty Crouch Jr. Peter Pettigrew. Bertha Jorkins.*

Bright, vivid green flashed through the mist like lightning across the sky. A shadow lingered where the white headstones stretched off into the fog, less than a spectre, yet the mist crept back from it as if burnt away by the sun.

Harry's wand slipped into his hand as he paused beside another pale memorial. *Dolores Umbridge.* He strode on and left the ink-black letters etched into the marble behind.

The shadow darkened to a thin-limbed wraith of jet black mist and extended one skeletal hand.

The fog rolled back.

Frozen mud, black-stained pale pebbles, and a fouled river lay at his feet. Faces swirled in the water: snatches of Fleur's smirk, Katie's grin, his parents waving from the Mirror of Erised, and a thousand other half-recalled moments gleamed in its depths. The dead branches of a willow tree trembled upon the far bank and endless graves stretched from beneath its withered boughs, fading into a bright, golden dawn.

Above it all, the spectre hovered, a slim shadow before the rising crescent of the burning, amber sun; it spread its arms out wide

and red light spilt forth past its shade like sunlight bursting through storm clouds.

The cold of the mud seeped into him. The endless graves sprawled so far into the dawn he could feel all the space stretching away into nothing and an awful emptiness clawed its way up inside Harry's chest. *No.* He shoved it down. *Never again. I'm not going back. I won't be that again.*

He raised his wand at the distant shadow, cold fury twisting

in his breast. 'Avada kedavra!'

A bright emerald flash washed the dawn away.

He jolted awake. Sunlight stabbed at his eyes through a gap in the curtains of his bed. Faint bird song drifted to his ears from outside.

'Tempus.' He squinted at the silver numbers. 'Almost seven.'

*And the Christmas holidays start tomorrow*.

Harry pulled his robes and rubbed the last vestiges of sleep from his eyes, slipping down to the common room.

Flames crackled and logs popped in the fireplace, spitting small sparks and ash onto the surrounding stones. Harry settled himself down beside it and rested his feet close to the fire.

*Now, what next?* He spun his wand round on his palm, enjoying the little washes of warmth that rushed across his skin. *I need to keep an eye on Umbridge. I need to find out about the Hall of Prophecies. And I need to pick a good moment to send Umbridge off to follow the spiders once I have.*

Harry yawned and waved his wand at the fireplace, twisting the smoke into a writhing serpent.

*But the only person who'll tell me about the Department of Mysteries is probably Sirius and he's still just about sticking with Dumbledore's policy of not telling me things.* He twirled his serpent of smoke in circles above the flames and drummed his fingers upon the arm of the chair. *But if Dumbledore gets thrown out, then Sirius should be willing to tell me what I need to know, so it comes back to choosing a good moment.*

'And I can't watch her myself.' A small, thin smile curved his lips. 'But perhaps Umbridge would like to have the focused attention of Hogwarts\'s only free elf.' His smile warmed a fraction. 'And it'd be nice to have a reason to see the mad little elf again, even if Dobby's a bit disturbing.'

Harry dragged himself out of the chair and cast the disillusionment charm, slipping out of the tower and toward the kitchens. He strode down the steps to the basement level, taking them two at a time, then along the well-lit corridor with its many paintings of food.

A large picture of fruit within a silver bowl blocked the corridor\'s end.

*And if what the twins have told me about Katie's alcohol inspired kitchen trips is true, I just need to tickle the pear.* Harry reached up and gave it a tentative tickle with his forefinger. *They better not have been having me on, I already feel like an idiot doing this.*

The green fruit giggled and shifted into a door handle. Harry twisted the doop open and stepped into the kitchens.

Endless shelves of brass and copper pans, and worn, stained wooden tables stretched beneath a high-vaulted ceiling. A horde of house elves bustled back and forth between the tables in a bizarre array of pillow covers, blanket patches, and mismatched cushion covers.

The door thudded shut behind Harry.

Hundreds of pairs of bulbous eyes swivelled to stare at him. The nearest elf lost his grip on his lemon and the yellow fruit rolled across the table and fell onto the floor.

*Creepy.*

'I'm looking for Dobby,' Harry said.

A pair of bright green eyes appeared with a loud crack. 'The great Harry Potter called.\' Dobby bobbed his head up and down, setting his ears to flapping like broken bats\' wings.

\'I have something I need your help with, Dobby,\' he murmured. 'There\'s a teacher at this school who\'s been harming the students---\'

\'Dobby knows the one the great Harry Potter means, but Dobby can\'t help, not while he\'s an elf of Hogwarts. He made an agreement.\'

Harry sighed. *So much for that brilliant plan.*

Dobby's green eyes bored through Harry's skull like a pair of

little lasers. \'Dobby could help if he had a *different* master.'

*Does he ever blink?*

\'If you had a new master, would you be able to watch her office and remove anything that could be dangerous to students from it?\' Harry asked.

\'Yes.\' Dobby nodded so hard his chin bumped against his chest. \'If Harry Potter offers, if he *wants*, then Dobby will be accepting him as his master and serving him as proudly as any elf could.\'

\'How should I offer?\' Harry enquired. \'Is there something I have to do?\'

\'Harry Potter has to offer Dobby his magic, once Dobby has touched and accepted a wizard\'s magic Dobby is bound to them.\'

*That would be useful. And he'd be loyal.* Harry considered it. *But I don't want him doing it out of some sense of obligation.*

*Nobody should be forced to play hero.*

\'Do you *want* to be bound to me, Dobby?\'

\'Dobby likes working here, but an elf is best off with the magic of a master and a family. Hogwarts has enough magic to keep house elves alive and sane, but it\'s distant magic, Harry Potter, not personal, it\'s *lonely* magic.\'

\'I\'m not sure if that\'s a yes?'

\'Dobby would most certainly like to have Harry Potter as a master. Harry Potter is a great wizard, one an elf would be proud to serve. Dobby heard how master Harry Potter dealt with his nasty former young master.\' A vicious grin crossed Dobby's face.

Harry edged back a little. *I forgot how much he hates the*

*Malfoys.*

times.

*that.*

\'Then I offer you my magic, Dobby,\' he said.

Dobby's whole body trembled and he blinked hard several

*He does blink.* Harry released a small sigh. *Thank fuck for*

Dobby reached out with one small hand and grasped

Harry\'s wrist. Magic surged to the surface and subsided like a freak wave.

Dobby shivered and straightened up. \'Master Harry Potter is a *very* great wizard. His magic is even stronger than Dobby imagined.\'

\'Can you watch Umbridge for me, Dobby?\' Harry murmured. \'And if she tries to harm a student, can you make sure she\'s stopped? I know you can use your magic within the school walls and remain undetected.\'

\'Dobby will stay and work at Hogwarts. He will make sure the nasty pink woman doesn\'t hurt any of Master Harry Potter\'s friends.\'

Harry smiled. \'Thank you, Dobby. Do you still want paying?\'

\'Master Harry Potter freed Dobby from -- from---\' Dobby\'s face screwed up in hatred '---from the *Malfoys* and lets him touch his magics. An elf is greatly affected by his master\'s magic and Master Harry Potter\'s magic is strong. Dobby owes him a debt that he can *never* repay.\'

'Well, if you change your mind, you only have to ask.'

*Gold's only gold. Loyal friends are far more precious.*

\'Dobby will go and start watching.' Dobby vanished with a

loud crack.

The other elves shuffled closer, crowding around Harry. One thrust half a slice of buttered toast wrapped in a napkin into his palm. Another placed the lemon in his other hand, nodding all the while.

'Thanks...' Harry gave them a wave and took a bite out of the toast. 'Until next time, I guess.'

*Though I'm not really sure what to do with this lemon.* He finished his toast and drifted back up toward the tower, listening to the swelling noise as everyone else awoke. *It's a bit early for anything particularly lemony.*

He stumbled into Katie in the passageway behind the Fat Lady, staggering forward as he held her to him to avoid knocking her over. The lemon slipped from his fingers and rolled out of sight.

\'Harry.' Katie's voice trembled. \'We have a problem, a *big*

problem.\'

'We do?' He grew aware of a warm, damp feeling soaking across the shoulder of his robes and how Katie's fingers curled tight into his robes round his back. 'What's wrong, Katie?'

Soft sobs came from where she buried her face in his robes.

A thick, hot knot clenched in Harry's stomach. *Merde. She's really upset. I've not seen her cry since we split up.*

He guided her back into the common room and took a seat. Katie slumped onto the arm of his chair, sliding down into a ball on his lap.

\'This.\' She held a copy of the Daily Prophet out.

Harry glanced down from her red eyes and tear-stained cheeks. *Love Triangle at Hogwarts. Rita Skeeter sheds light!* The bottom dropped out of his stomach.

\'Fuck,' he muttered.

Katie jabbed her finger at the third paragraph. \'This bit.'

Harry skimmed down to it. \'Undeterred by the obstacle, I ventured to discover the truth of the matter. Ginny Weasley, a fourth year Gryffindor student and close friend of Harry Potter, whose sensational stories and history have often been a feature of my articles, has set herself on winning the heart of the Boy-Who-Lived. Your intrepid reporter has discovered that not only does Mr Potter appear to be allowing her affections, but, at the same time, is pursuing a relationship with former flame and ex-quidditch teammate, Katie Bell. The two were known to be briefly together before the Yule Ball last year, but separated under suspicious circumstances when the impressionable Mr Potter suddenly chose to abandon his girlfriend and accompany the part-human, French champion Fleur Delacour instead.\'

\'It gets better.\' Fresh tears leaked from under Katie's lashes. '*Much* better.'

\'It seems that having fallen for the allure of Miss Delacour, who subsequently abandoned him, Mr Potter learnt a few tricks of his own about manipulating the opposite sex. Now, he can be seen stringing along two young, innocent girls in his sordid games. Miss Bell, who according to reliable sources is often seen in close company of Harry Potter, was allegedly the slighted party when he assaulted and gravely injured a fellow student. You may remember, my readers, that this offence saw him rightly banned from playing quidditch. Since then, Miss Bell has become all but inseparable from him as he encourages her to bully and torment younger students.\'

Harry scanned the first line of the next paragraph. *Dark*

*magic and debauchery in Hogwarts's dormitories.*

Katie curled into a ball on his lap with her head against his

shoulder. 'See. It's *awful.*'

\'Well, Fleur's *definitely* going to murder me this time.\' Harry's heart sank somewhere down into a dark, deep void.

*And even if she forgives me one more time, Gabby and her parents*

*will see this...*

\'My parents are going to murder me,\' Katie whispered. \'They believe the Prophet's rooted in truth, even if it dresses things up to get people to read it.\'

\'I\'m sorry,' he murmured. \'It\'s being around me that\'s dragged you into this. If you want to keep your distance or pretend to dislike me, then I understand.\'

*I'll survive. I survived being alone before. I'll survive it again.* Dread coiled its tight sharp spines round his heart. *But I don't want to. I don't.*

\'The whole school is going to think I\'m some kind of slut,' Katie spat. \'How did Skeeter even know about any of this?\' She stabbed her finger at the article. 'That\'s word for word what Ginny said outside the portrait last night, but there was nobody there but us. It was the same with all her other articles, too.'

*It is word for word, isn't it? She must've been there.* Harry frowned. *But how would she get through the wards undetected? Nobody's managed it since Sirius came after Pettigrew.* His mind was drawn to the beetle he had seen crawling over Ginny\'s top. *Maybe she did it the exact same way.*

\'I think I might know how,\' he said.

\'What?\' Katie demanded. 'I hope it's illegal. I'll *destroy* her.' 'Perhaps she's an unregistered animagus.'

\'Ginny had a beetle on her. It was bright blue.' Katie beamed. 'If she\'s unregistered, she could be sent to Azkaban.'

\'I\'m not going to try and expose her.\' Harry sighed. \'She\'s useful to the Ministry at the moment and she knows it. Until they stop needing her to discredit me, nothing will happen.\'

*Although there might be a chance to get back at her more subtly somehow.*

\'So she\'s going to get away with this.\' Katie seethed and balled her fists. \'This article is going to make everything *hell.*'

'It's not exactly ideal.'

\'What if I tell everyone about Skeeter?\' Katie suggested. \'You\'ve been manipulated and tricked by me, remember,\'

Harry said.

\'There\'s really nothing we can do,\' she whispered. \'We just have to live with it.\'

\'Skeeter will eventually write something offensive about someone dangerous and get her just reward for it,\' Harry said. 'It\'s far worse for Ginny than us.'

Katie slumped and stared into the fire. 'Because she loves you... And now everyone is going to know and think the worst of her for it.\'

\'Exactly. I don\'t think I\'ll be seeing very much of Ginny for the foreseeable future.\'

Katie smeared her tears away on her sleeve and dabbed her cheeks dry. Streaks of dark mascara smudged across the skin beneath her eyes. 'Urgh. I bet I look like a complete mess, now, don't I?'

Harry gave her weak grin and a thumbs up. 'But a cute mess, if you had that seashell bra\...'

She snorted. 'Definitely can't make that joke too loudly *now*.'

Footsteps sounded from the girls' dormitories' stairs. Katie froze and threw herself into the chair opposite Harry with a small squeak.

Alicia loomed out of the dark. \'Oh, you\'re down here, Katie.\' She frowned and shot a black glare at Harry. \'Have you been *crying*?\'

*Alicia will cheer Katie up better than me.* Harry smothered the slow swelling of freezing rage. *And Rita Skeeter deserves some payback.*

\'I\'m going for a walk to think.\' He helped himself to some spare parchment, a quill, and some ink. 'I\'ll let you and Alicia talk about things without an unwelcome audience.\'

*I'll send Rita Skeeter a letter and get hold of the address.*

*Let's see where that takes me.*

He made his way out of the tower again, ignoring Alicia\'s whispering, and headed for the Owlery. A yawning, upper year Slytherin holding a small basket of bright flowers crossed paths with him on his way back from the greenhouses.

*Miss Rita Skeeter.* Harry paused to lean on the wall and write on the envelope, then scribbled the same on his spare parchment. *As a former friend of certain Hogwarts students, I've been privy to some of their actions. However, in recent times, their actions have grown offensive and dangerous. I\'d be more than willing to share what I know with you, if you're interested.* He tore the bottom part of the parchment off and cast the protean charm to link it to the envelope.

'And just one more enchantment...' He pushed his magic into the envelope, imbuing it with the ability to mimic nearby similar objects. 'An envelope to mimic the address on any mail nearby and the protean charm to copy it into my pocket.' Harry turned it over in his head. 'Should work.'

*And I can't ask Fleur for a clever way.* He grimaced and buried a hot, sharp tangle of feeling. *She won't want to see me.*

Harry trudged his way up the tower, folded the letter into the envelope and sealed it.

\'This is for Rita Skeeter, Hedwig.\' He offered the envelope to his owl. \'Make sure you deliver it to her home, not to her work, or anywhere else.\'

Hedwig stared at him with her amber eyes, fluffed her feathers, then let out a soft hoot, hopped toward the window and took off into the sky.

*Time for breakfast, I suppose.* Harry plodded back to the Great Hall.

Whispers pursued him the whole way. Katie and Ginny's

names echoed after him in hushed hisses.

*Here we go again.* He gritted his teeth and strode into the hall. *But you won't see me care. Fleur's right. They just want to tear down anyone they fear might be better than themselves.* Harry chose a spot close to the end of the Gryffindor table and helped himself to sausages, eggs and toast.

Katie came down a few mouthfuls later and headed toward him, but Alicia and Angelina trapped her in between the two of them and went to join the twins. Harry raised an eyebrow at her down the table. She gave him a small shrug and sliced a piece of toast into smaller and smaller pieces on her plate.

*I shouldn\'t have made that offer.* He sighed and forced down another mouthful of food. *I survived before. I'll survive again.* A cold fist clamped 'round his heart. *Just as long Fleur's still with me.*

Katie folded her arms on the table and flopped onto them.

*It\'s a shame I can\'t make Rita Skeeter disappear under the Dark Mark*. Harry stabbed the yolk of his fried egg and watched it spread across his toast. *Maybe I'll get lucky and she'll write an article about Voldemort's stub of a nose.*

\'Has it offended you?\' Nev swung himself in beside him. \'It\'s not going to be a good day.'

\'Seen the paper, then. Well, it gets better, Umbridge first thing with ammunition to use against you.\'

\'I can keep my cool around her,\' Harry said.

*Even if it's only by imagining how her little hike through the*

*Forbidden Forest is going to end.*

\'It still won\'t be any fun,\' Nev said. \'I\'ve heard from Gran this morning that there\'s another Educational Decree being passed today, something that lets Umbridge assess and dismiss the other teachers.\'

\'*Wonderful*. At this rate the whole school will be carpeted and draped in pink, and students will be writing their exams in blood.\'

Nev poured himself some orange juice and took a long drink. \'Have you spoken to Katie or Ginny?\'

\'I talked to Katie this morning. She showed me the article. Angelina and Alicia have since convinced her to avoid me, or are at least trying to make sure that she does.\'

Nev winced. 'Ouch. Sorry, mate. Can't say I've ever split with anyone, but I'd guess it's not great.' He glanced down the table. 'She looks miserable.'

\'It worries me when she\'s quiet,\' Harry murmured. \'So you haven\'t spoken to Ginny, then?\'

Harry shook his head. \'I haven\'t seen her.\'

\'It\'s a bit of a mess.\' Nev helped himself to bacon. \'Ron\'s furious about it, of course, Dean too.\'

\'I take it they blame me.\'

Nev shrugged and swallowed his mouthful of bacon. \'I\'m not sure, but probably.\'

The other Gryffindors brushed past them, Ginny in their midst, and went to sit with Katie and the twins.

*Guess I don't matter, do I?* Harry rolled his eyes and swallowed a flare of anger. *Whatever. I've got more important stuff*

*to deal with.* Fleur's pitch black eyes and heat-haze-wreathed palms flashed through his mind. *And possibly a painful death.*

He dropped his cutlery on his plate and swept out of the Great Hall, sweeping through the corridors, and taking his seat at the back of Umbridge's class. She glowered at him through the straps of her pink handbag.

The other students shuffled in and sagged into their seats.

Umbridge simpered. \'Wands away. This lesson we will be discussing the theory of dark magic and why it is so dangerous to practise.\'

*Says the woman who doesn't even know enough magical theory to conjure some tasteful clothes. You don't wear that shade of pink with that complexion.* Harry wrinkled his nose at the pink cardigan and hummed. *I think Fleur might be rubbing off on me.*

\'Dark magic is labelled by the Ministry as some of the most dangerous magic in existence,\' Umbridge recited. \'There're a whole list of reasons that lead to spells being classified as dark, but the underlying similarity is that they are corruptive.\'

Her gaze came to rest on Harry.

*I suppose it will at least be amusingly contrived.*

\'A wizard who practises or is exposed to dark magic becomes addicted to it. They're twisted into dangerous, intolerable individuals with no respect for authority, society, or morals.\' Umbridge's stare didn't shift.

Harry gave her a long yawn.

Her face spasmed. \'Half-breeds and dark creatures cannot be trusted for the same reason, dark magic affects them making them dangerous to their superiors. Things like werewolves, goblins, and *veela*influence all who consort with them.\'

A ball of ice tightened beneath his ribs; it ground at Harry's patience like the weight of a glacier, wearing it thin as paper. He clenched his fingers tight about the hot ebony of his wand..

\'Known dark spells to have this effect are of course spells like the Unforgivables. Those exposed to such magic become violent, amoral, and inhuman, influencing and perverting those around them until their infection can be purged. Sadly, such individuals often lead others very far astray from what could be considered proper behaviour, engaging in all sorts of *lewd* activities.\'

*We\'ll have our revenge*. Harry forced the glacier to fade into the endless void inside. *Every insult now will make things sweeter. The more it hurts to have, the more satisfying it is to have it.*

Ron\'s jaw snapped shut with an audible snap. The tips of his ears and the back of his neck turned scarlet.

\'Do you have something to add, Mr Weasley?\' Umbridge's tone oozed sweetness.

*He\'s going to explode.*

The door creaked open and Professor Dumbledore stepped into the room. \'I\'m afraid, I need three of your students to come with me, Dolores. They will not be returning to the lesson.\'

Two patches of pink appeared on Umbridge's cheeks. \'Might

I inquire *who* and *why*, headmaster?\'

\'You may.' Dumbledore stood there with a serene smile on

his face and studied the wall behind her.

\'Whom do you require, headmaster?\' Umbridge's sweetness

slipped.

\'Mr Weasley, Miss Granger and Mr Potter.'

*Interesting.* Harry picked up his bag, nodding to Nev and

rising to his feet. *But probably not good.*

\'Why are you removing them from my lesson?\' Umbridge

asked.

Dumbledore's smile shifted into something stern. \'I\'m afraid

that it\'s a family matter, Dolores, and as you are neither their head of house nor the headmaster, I cannot discuss it with you, *especially* not in front of other students.\'

*A family matter.* He grimaced. *Ginny...*

\'Follow me, please.' Dumbledore led them to the stature that led up to his office. \'Ice Mice.'

'Is Ginny\... okay? Hermione whispered. 'Have you seen her?' Ron clenched his jaw. 'Shut up, Hermione.'

Mrs Weasley and all her children save Percy stood in the headmaster's office. They turned sad, angry eyes and pale, drawn faces on Harry. Ginny clung to her mother's sleeve, sobbing. Mrs Weasley patted her on the head.

\'Earlier this morning, while assisting the Order in guarding something very important, Arthur Weasley lost his life.\' Dumbledore\'s tone turned quiet and grim. \'He was attacked by Voldemort\'s familiar, the serpent, Nagini, outside the Department of

Mysteries. He died before help could reach him. I am very sorry for your loss. He was a brave, good man that we will all dearly miss.\'

*How many other brave, good people have died following you.* Harry frowned. *Why was his snake even there? Voldemort must be after something in the Department. That's what the Order are guarding.*

Quiet murmurs filled the office. Harry lingered in his corner and let the melancholy seep away into the abyss.

Dumbledore folded his hands on the surface of his desk. 'I fear many of us will have to make terrible sacrifices to see Voldemort defeated.'

*Meaning me, no doubt.* Harry grimaced. *Perhaps I should also get rid of whatever Voldemort's after while I'm down there, instead of letting Dumbledore send people to die for it.*

'I'm sorry for your loss,' he murmured, taking one last glance at the grieving Weasley family and Hermione and slipping back down the stairs.

# Last Christmas

Sunlight beamed through the window, flashing and rippling along the bottom of the sink. Fleur placed her hands upon the water and let them sink into the warmth.

\'When is Harry arriving, Fleur?\' Gabby bounced down the stairs clutching an armful of chocolate-stained mugs.

Maman and Papa exchanged a long look, glancing at the copy of the Daily Prophet upon the kitchen table.

Fleur let a little heat creep from her palms and the water in

the sink steamed and hissed. \'Soon.'

*And we will be having a talk about Katie Bell.* Fleur watched her eyes darken in the window as the water bubbled and frothed.

*Again.*

\'In ten minutes,\' Maman said. \'It will be nice to talk with him a little more, it\'s hard to really get to know someone in such a *short* period of time.\'

*Another little jab.* Fleur wrenched her hands from the sink. Heat bubbled through the bones and the water steamed from her fingers. *She is lucky she is Maman, or I would curse her.*

Her parents grimaced.

Maman's eyes darkened and she raised her chin. 'Fleur, ma

Cherie.'

Heat haze shimmered round her hands. 'Non, Maman! One

more word! One more little snide comment! One more jab! I will

remind you which of us is the better!'

'*Fleur!'* Papa snapped.

Fleur whirled on him. 'You are just as bad!' Blue flames sprang up on her palms. 'And *you* are not resistant to heat, Papa!'

They stared.

\'It's not hard for me to get to know someone,\' Gabby chirped, wielding hot chocolate powder, milk, cream and spoon to disastrous effect beside the sink and scampering across the kitchen to press her cold mug of hot chocolate into Fleur's flame-wreathed hands. 'Merci, Fleur!'

The heat melted from Fleur's blood. \'Gabby would be able to know a little about what he was like just from touching his magic.\' She let the flames linger until the hot chocolate steamed and pushed it into Gabby's hands. 'There you go, greedy little bird.'

Maman drew herself up. \'Gabrielle\'s magic is not something that should be used lightly, just as your stronger allure shouldn't be. I don\'t want to hear of either of you using them on anyone who doesn\'t understand what it means and hasn\'t given permission.\'

\'Harry\'s magic is really powerful.\' Gabby sighed. \'His wand felt completely different to any of yours.'

Maman's face twisted. 'What did it feel like?'

Papa held his breath.

\'Not telling!\' Gabby dunked her teaspoon into the mug and stirred the cream in, sending small waves of hot chocolate froth over the sides of the mug.

*Maybe all that clafoutis helped after all.*

*\'Gabrielle!*' Maman drew herself up. 'We just want some

assurance that what the papers are saying about him is not true.\'

\'And obviously my word wasn\'t enough,\' Fleur hissed. \'Harry is *perfect* for Fleur.\' A mischievous glint appeared in

Gabby's eyes. \'If she didn\'t love him so much, I would steal him instead. He saved me from the lake. If he\'d kissed me and woken me up it would have been the perfect moment.\'

*Urgh. Nobody kisses Harry but me. Ever.*

Fleur scowled. 'You know you weren\'t in any danger, little chick.' She plucked the mug of hot chocolate from Gabby's hands and stole a sip. 'And if you ever kiss him, even jokingly, or direct your magic at him and risk leaving a lasting impression, I will scorch you to ashes, baby sister.'

'You're so *possessive*, Fleur.' Gabby giggled. \'You don't need to worry, anyway. You sent one pleading look at Harry and he went and saved me. He was coughing up blood from what I heard.\'

Fleur turned her nose up at Gabby. 'Hush, Gabby.' Maman looked thoughtful. 'Is that true?'

\'What does it matter,\' Fleur snapped, heat flashing through her. Feathers rippled along her skin, her eyes swelled large and turned black, and her skull shifted shape. \'I *chose* him. That's the first and last statement you need on the subject. He doesn't *need* to have to bleed and suffer to prove anything to anyone else!\'

Maman flinched and Papa winced.

Gabby shivered and took a sip of her hot chocolate. 'Fleur,'

she whispered. *'Easy*.'

'Pardon.' She closed her eyes and waited for the heat to fade. 'I am sick of this. *All* this. Your stupid comments, him being far away, that stupid paper and those English idiots.' Fleur ground her teeth. 'And that Katie Bell,' she muttered. 'Cette pute, je la *brûlerai* avant de perdre contre elle.'

Gabby shuddered. 'You wouldn't burn anyone, Fleur,' she

murmured.

Fleur fixed her with a long look. 'I'd burn her,' she whispered. 'No shallow little girls are going to steal anything important from me ever again.'

Maman and Papa edged closer.

\'We don\'t like you being with someone so dangerous,\' Papa said. \'We've discussed this before, whether the rumours are true or not does not matter, either way you'll be targeted by someone who could hurt you.\'

\'I am a stronger and better dueller than either of you, Maman, Papa.\' Fleur raised her chin. 'If one of us is to judge, it ought to be me, non?'

Maman fidgeted. \'Better than the Death Eaters of Britain?

Harry Potter is not the enemy of ordinary wizards.\'

\'Harry is not an ordinary wizard and I am not an ordinary

witch.'

Papa sighed. 'Fleur---'

\'I'm going to meet him.' She pictured the willow tree and

apparated away with a loud crack.

Harry stood beneath the frost-patched tree, dressed in muggle clothing. 'Fleur!' He stepped toward her one hand outstretched, then froze. 'I'm sorry, it's not true, *none* of it's true, I swear. I *will* swear. Any vow, anything you ask.' He swallowed. 'I promise, Fleur. I would *never*. You're the one *perfect* wish that came true for me.'

Fleur closed the distance between them, slid her fingers into his messy, dark hair and dragged his lips to hers. \'Idiot. I do not need you to swear.' She took a firm grip on him and held his face an inch from hers. 'I am temptedbecause then you'd *always* be mine, but no.'

He sagged within her arms. 'That's good.' A small smile graced his lips. 'I was scared.'

*Scared I'd leave?* Fleur saw the shadow of that fear in his eyes; a deep, dark, vast thing and him just a small silhouette beneath it. *I will never leave, not so long as you're mine.*

'I'd never do something like that to you.' Harry tugged her hands from his hair and held them to his chest. 'Even if I went completely mad and decided I wanted to leave you, I'd never betray you like that. *Never.* And if that does happen, just lock me in a padded cell somewhere until I snap out of it, ma Princesse.'

Fleur smirked and freed one hand, coating it in blue flames. \'I would turn you to ashes if you ever did anything to hurt me like that.\'

tree...\'

Harry grinned. \'As long as you bury me under our willow

Fleur's insides turned all cold and the fire guttered out on

her fingers. \'Don\'t say things like that. It\'s not at all funny.\'

\'What about your family?\' Harry asked. \'Do they believe anything about the article?\'

'Gabby laughed.' Fleur grimaced. 'Maman and Papa are *still* being difficult. I yelled at them just now. I don't think they believe it, the articles are *ridiculous,* but they don't like other things.'

Harry's smile faded. \'They won\'t ever approve of me, will they? I\'ll either be a dangerous dark wizard, or Voldemort will be coming after me and anyone close to me.\'

\'They do not dislike *you*.\' Fleur's heart twisted and she offered him a helpless shrug. 'I'm sorry, monCœur. It's not personal.'

\'It feels personal,\' Harry said. \'I had this faint hope that I could just step in at your side and find myself part of a family.\' His smile turned bitter. \'I should know better by now, wishes like that don't come true.\'

*One did.*

Fleur pouted and squeezed his fingers. 'Non? Not even one

of them.'

A small smile slid back onto his face. 'Maybe one.'

She laughed. 'There is no *maybe.* Now we must head inside

and deal with the more important things, like what you bought Gabby for Christmas.\'

\'I think she will like it. I don\'t really know what anyone expects so I tried to get something I felt fitted.\'

\'I wouldn\'t worry too much about your present for Gabby. She just loves being given things. If you gave her pebbles from the river she would hoard them just like she does everything else.\' Fleur

linked their arms. \'If anything, we should be more concerned about what *she* might have bought *us*.'

'Oh no.' Harry groaned. 'It's going to be something *awful.'*

Fleur laughed. 'Probably.' She whisked them both back into

the entrance hall.

Harry surveyed the array of footwear. \'I finally understand

all the shoes.'

\'They're almost all Gabby's. She is incorrigible. Maman has given up trying to get rid of them, I think Gabby has bribed Binky to make sure that they don\'t get thrown away.\'

He chuckled. \'How sneaky.'

'Mon Cœur!' Gabby scampered down the hall and skidded to a halt. 'Nice girlfriend! She's almost as cute as me!'

*Mon Cœur...* Fleur glowered at Gabby's mischievous grin. *I*

*don't know why I tell you things, you brat.*

\'Thanks, Gabby, I found her all by myself!' Harry slipped his arm round Fleur's waist. 'Now I can't get rid of her.' He glanced at the piles of shoes. \'Nice shoes.\'

\'They are all Fleur\'s.\' Gabby giggled. 'Now come on, it's time for Christmas things again.'

Harry gasped. \'And you lied to me and told me that they all

belonged to your innocent baby sister!'

\'I wanted you to buy me more.' She released a long deep sigh and pulled out her wand. \'But I suppose it really is time I threw away all my old shoes.\'

quipped.

Gabby squeaked and darted in front of her shoes.

\'You seem very attached to your sister\'s shoes,' Harry

\'You shouldn\'t just throw things away.\' Gabby pouted. \'It\'s

not right.\'

'Come on, monCœur,' Fleur whispered in Harry's ear. 'Putting it off won't make it any better.'

Harry nudged her in the stomach with his elbow, but let her lead him into the lounge.

\'Harry.' Her parents offered him a thin, polite smile.

\'How has your first term back at Hogwarts been?' Maman

asked.

truth---'

A soft sigh escaped Harry. \'Not the best.'

Papa stuck out his hand. 'Yes, well, I'm sure there's no

\'Are we giving gifts now?\' Gabby sprawled across one of

the more comfortable sofas and pushed her feet up against the pale stonework of the wall.

\'You already gave us your gifts,\' Maman said. \'You couldn't wait until lunch and Harry\'s arrival, so you pestered Fleur for an hour about her present for you.\'

\'Harry doesn\'t know any of the other people who gave us things,\' Gabby said. \'I still have my present for him and Fleur.\' Mischief gleamed in her eyes.

*It\'s definitely going to be something horribly embarrassing*.

Harry chuckled. 'I'm looking forward to it, Gabby. Fleur will make her mortified face.'

Fleur huffed at him. 'You will turn red as a tomato.'

'I'll still get to see your embarrassed pout.' He leant to her

ear. 'It's almost as cute as those little gasps you make when---' Fleur trod on his foot, heat rushing to her face. 'Aww.' Gabby giggled. 'You've gone all pink, Fleur.' *You and Harry are a bad combination.*

Fleur turned her nose up at Gabby. \'Here.' She reached behind the nearest sofa and produced a small, thin wooden box. 'Try not to break this one.'

Gabby turned it over in her hands before sliding off the lid. The sparkling, white camellia Fleur'd sculpted from ice lay on dark velvet within.

\'You always ask me to make them for you, so I thought you

might want a more permanent one, little chick.'

\'It\'s so pretty,\' Gabby chirped. She took it out of the box and twirled it in the light. \'It really won\'t melt?

\'Not for a long time,\' Fleur promised. \'And never so long as one of us keeps replacing the enchantments on it.\'

\'Thank you, Fleur.\' Gabby put the flower back in the box and spun to Harry. 'Is it tasty? It *better* be tasty. Your girlfriend's sister is the first person you need to make like you...'

Harry laughed and pulled a handful of tiny presents from his pocket. A faint glimmer of light came from his sleeve as he put them on the arm of the sofa, then they swelled to normal size.

*Books. Two books.* Fleur studied the other two. *Not sure about those two.*

\'This one is yours, Gabby.\' Harry picked up one of the odd- shaped ones and passed it across.

She beamed and unpeeled the shining red and gold paper.

Harry waited with a bright smile fixed on his face.

*Aww, you'renervous, mon Cœur.* Fleur smiled and gave his fingers a gentle squeeze.

Gabby squealed and pulled a colourful, bright, china mug

overflowing with sugar quills. 'It *is* tasty!'

Fleur laughed. *Cherry flavour, too.*

'You said I owed you one.\' Harry grinned. 'They mug's enchanted to be unbreakable, to keep your drink warm, and the colours will disappear if something suspicious finds its way into your drink.\'

\'It\'s perfect.' Gabby pocketed the sweets before Maman could intervene. 'Merci, Harry. If Fleur decides she doesn't want you, I'll keep you instead.'

'Thanks.' Harry chuckled. 'Hopefully you won't have to stick

to that.'

Gabby shrugged. 'It'd be okay.' She giggled. 'Fleur would be

*so* cross. She'd hurl fire at me again.'

Fleur swatted Gabby with a cushion. 'You find your own.

This one is mine. And I *don't* share.'

'No.' Gabby sulked. 'You are *terrible* at sharing, especially

tasty sweet things.'

\'These are for you, Monsieur Delacour, Madam Delacour.\' Harry passed the two that looked like books over to her parents sofa. \'I thought you might appreciate them.\'

Papa unwrapped his, peeking behind the cover of a weathered, aged tome. \'I can't read the date, but there's a good chance this is one of the oldest books on wizarding genealogy I\'ve ever had the privilege of touching. This isn\'t something to give away lightly, Harry, there can\'t be more than a handful of copies of this left in existence.\'

Harry blinked. \'I know you like history, heraldry, and the like.

It caught my eye and the owner was willing to part with it.\'

\'I shudder to think what the price was,' Papa muttered, flicking through the pages. 'This is a thousand years old or more if I'm not mistaken, a lot of these families were wiped out by the Normans.'

\'That was a terrible present, Harry,\' Gabby piped up. \'We\'re not going to see Papa for weeks now. He\'ll lock himself in his study with your book and won\'t come out for anything but meals.\'

\'I\'m sure Binky wouldn\'t mind bringing my food to my study.\' Papa traced his fingers over the old pages. \'This is quite fascinating.\'

Gabby scowled.

Maman hid her smile behind her hand, then tugged the string loose from her present. \'I\'m not going to open this and find some incredibly rare potions ingredient am I?\'

that?\'

Harry shifted. \'Would you have preferred something like

Another book slid out of the paper. A battered, scarred cover

enclosed thick, yellow pages.

*That's as old as the other book.*

*\'Obscure Potions and Unique Ingredients*. I've never heard of it.\' Maman read through the first page, then gasped. \'Do you know who this was written by?\'

\'Helga Hufflepuff.\' A faint smile crossed Harry's face. \'I don\'t think it\'s the original, but it\'s handwritten and autographed. I wouldn't suggest trying anything you find toward the very end of the book, the magical trees you'll grow are very violent and quite dangerous.\'

Papa glanced up. \'Your idea of normal Christmas presents are two virtually priceless books... Where did you find them? Once might be a coincidence, but to find two rare books so well suited for us can\'t be.\'

\'I stumbled across a collection actually.' A small smile played on Harry's lips. \'I chose two that I thought you would appreciate and I doubt I will ever value them as highly as you will, so they\'re better off here.\'

Papa laughed. \'We might have to improve the wards on the chateau if someone finds out about this. This is the sort of indisputable evidence of blood relations that some wizarding families would do a great deal to own.\'

\'It\'s not too much, is it?\' Harry's clammy fingers shifted beneath Fleur's. \'I\'ve never really done this before.\'

Fleur squeezed his hand. 'They're good presents, monCœur.'

Gabby smirked. \'If that\'s what he bought for you, I can't

imagine what he bought Fleur.\'

Fleur's heart lurched. *Oh merde. What if it's much better*

*than what I got him?*

\'I think I\'ll give you my present *first*,\' she said.

\'It\'s a little more than we expected,\' Maman murmured. \'It makes our present for you seem very inadequate.\' She passed Harry a soft package. \'Fleur mentioned that you don\'t actually own any dress robes, so we took the liberty of choosing some suitably stylish ones. She said that black, dark greens or blues, and silver suited you, so I hope you like them.\'

Harry raised an eyebrow at her.

She laughed. \'I am veela. I can feel magic, not as well as Gabby, but I know when you\'re wearing charmed or transfigured clothing, it\'s saturated with your magic.\' Fleur reached into her pocket and pulled out a small cloth bag. \'Here, this is my gift for you.'

Harry dipped his fingers into the bag and pulled out a slim

piece of wood. 'A ring?'

\'I made it from one of the branches of the willow tree.\' She tossed her hair over her shoulder. 'It is the prettiest thing you own and you will wear it where *everyone* can see it.'

*But especially Katie Bell.*

\'Fleur!\' Gabby stood on her tiptoes and craned her neck over Harry's shoulder. \'It\'s too early for you to get engaged and *Harry\'s* meant to be the one who proposes to *you*.\'

Fleur flushed. *I will toast Gabby later*.

\'It's perfect.\' Harry shot her a warm smile. \'As always.'

Her heart squirmed. \'Wear it on your wand hand. I tried to imbue it with the desire to protect you, so while you're wearing it the magic I put into the ring will protect you.\' She cupped his chin. 'I don't want you to ever use it.'

\'Thank you,' he murmured, slipping the ring onto his right forefinger.

\'My turn!\' Gabby pulled her wand out and waved it at the far

wall. 'Ta da!'

Harry choked and a small squeak slipped through Fleur's lips. Maman's eyebrows vanished into her fringe and Papa's book slipped shut. The willow and the river shone beneath the autumn sun on canvas within a light wood frame. Harry kissed Fleur beneath the leaves, his fingers in her silver hair and at her waist.

Fleur blinked liquid heat from her lashes and swallowed a hot fist of feeling. 'I'm sure you weren't invited to that particular rendezvous, Gabby, but thank you. C'est parfait.'

\'I snuck down after you one day and sent the memory to a

portrait maker in Paris.\' Gabby beamed. 'Do you like it, Harry?'

He tore his eyes away from the painting and nodded. 'Yes.'

Gabby sidled 'round Fleur with a coy smile. 'Want to make another one with me instead of Fleur?'

Fleur sighed. \'You are the *worst*, Gabby.'

Harry laughed. 'What would you do if I actually said yes?' 'Panic.' Gabby giggled. 'Fleur would murder me.'

'And me, too,' Harry said. 'We\'ll have to run away together before she realises.'

'Flouting all social conventions for the sake of the heart.' Gabby pressed her hands to her breast. 'So romantic.'

'Hush, you two.' Fleur's lips curved into a pout and she pointed her finger at Gabby. 'You, you need to stop reading Maman's books. And you...' She swivelled 'round on Harry. 'You stop encouraging Gabby just because you like to make me pout.'

'It's a very cute pout,' Harry murmured in her ear. His lips

brushed her earlobe and a little shiver rippled through her.

'Careful, monCœur,' Fleur whispered back. 'I still owe you more than just kisses.'

*Because what you did beneath the willow tree was very good.* She fought her flush down. *And if I have my way, you'll be doing it again later.*

Gabby flopped back into the sofa. 'What did you get Fleur, Harry?'

\'I couldn\'t think of anything that I could make that would be anywhere near as good as something you could make yourself,\' Harry said. \'So I thought I'd give you these instead. I\'m told they're useful for holding all sorts of things.\'

The present he placed in her hands gave a gentle clink.

Fleur slid the paper away. A dark wooden box decorated with carved vine leaves lay beneath. She opened the lid and found a handful of small, crystal bottles stoppered with tiny, rune-engraved corks. Silver mist swirled within them.

\'Those are memories...' Fleur glanced at Harry. 'Yours?'

'They're very nice vials, but I wanted to put something important inside.'

She kissed him on the cheek. 'Thank you.'

'My perspective,' he murmured. 'I won't tell you what they are of, though, that would spoil the surprise.' He shot her a grin. 'Though I was *very* tempted to make one of them me winning the Triwizard Tournament.'

'Cheat.' Fleur stuck her tongue out at him. 'You cheated.'

Harry laughed. 'I seem to remember you stalking all your rivals and knowing an awful lot about that dragon task before you were supposed to.'

'I will win next time when we do some duelling.' She turned her nose up at him. 'You'll see.'

\'Can I see the memories?\' Gabby pleaded.

\'No.\' Fleur shut the lid and crossed her arms over the box. \'They\'re mine.\'

Gabby pouted. 'Why're you such a rubbish sharer, Fleur?' 'Greedy little bird,' Fleur shot back. 'You've got enough

sugar quills for a small school, you should be happy with those.'

Maman looked up from her book. \'Lunch will be in an hour, ma Cherie. If you want to go watch the memories together, we'll keep Gabrielle from mischief.\'

Fleur shot Gabby a broad smirk, then stood and led Harry to the basement. *I'm going to beat him at duelling. See if you're so happy about being Triwizard Champion then, monCœur.*

'This seems an odd choice of place.' Harry glanced around the small room and out through the door at the racks of wine. 'There aren't an abundance of seats.'

\'I\'m not going to watch the memories now, I have you here

already.\'

\'So what are we up to?\'

'I'm going to duel you.' Fleur smirked. 'And beat you.'

Harry laughed. 'Ok, ma Princesse.' His smile gained a sharp

edge. 'You can *try*.'

\'First, where did you really get those books from? I know you didn\'t realise how rare they were.\'

\'I stumbled across them at Hogwarts. I had three copies of the one I gave your mother and five of the book I gave your father.\'

\'You *stumbled* across them.' Fleur scowled and stepped

close to him.. 'You're keeping secrets from me, monCœur.'

'I have a few left,' he murmured. 'Not many, though.' Fleur's stomach twisted and turned. 'I want you to tell me.'

She huffed. 'And I want you to *want* to tell me.'

'You're so wanty,' Harry teased. He bumped her nose with his. 'Such a *demanding* veela.'

'Whose fault is that?' Fleur whispered, brushing her lips against his. 'I think you *like* making me ask, non? You did before...'

Heat crept onto Harry's face. 'Maybe a little,' he murmured.

'But I think you liked asking, too.'

Fleur stepped back and smirked. 'Alas, lunch is only a short time away, monCœur.'

'Alas.' Harry's tone turned dry as sandpaper. 'So if you didn't lead me down into your dungeon to have your way with me, ma Princesse, what did you want?'

Fleur pushed her lips into a pout. 'You *know* what I want.' 'Secrets.' Harry tried to keep the smile from his face, but

failed. 'Ok. I'll give you two, but...' A bright, little glimmer welled up in

his eyes. 'You have to *ask*.'

'Oh *now* he wants to play games.' Fleur swept her hair over her shoulder. 'Let me think.'

*What do I want to know most?* She weighed things up.

*Katie Bell? This mysterious collection of invaluable books? Whatever*

*he's up to back in England?*

'What're you up to in England?'

'Ah.' Harry winced a fraction. 'Can I answer that one last?'

Fleur crossed her arms. 'Fine. Where did you really get those books?'

'A secret chamber.' Mirth glittered in his green eyes. 'I will take you there to meet what's left of my family soon, I promise. Is that enough?'

She rested her arms over his shoulders. 'Promise?' 'I do.'

Fleur's heart lurched. 'Careful with that line, monCœur,' she whispered. 'Put that ring somewhere else and I'll never let you go again.'

Harry swallowed. 'Right. Aren't I supposed to get some say in it, though?'

'As if you'd disagree.' Fleur slid her hands into his hair. 'Now, you owe me another secret.'

Harry sighed and the humour faded from his eyes. 'Do you remember the prophecy I mentioned?'

'Of course.'

'I did some digging about the Department of Mysteries and I tried to get people to realise Voldemort's back by casting the Dark Mark over where my parents died -- I might have to do that again, since it didn't work too well. Anyway, Dumbledore's followers are guarding something in the Department of Mysteries. Voldemort's are trying to get in. One of my friend's parents died trying to stop them a few days ago...'

'So you're going to kill two birds with one stone.' Fleur's abdomen shrank into a tight ball. 'You're going to try and break in.'

'I have to oust Dumbledore first, then my godfather will help me. And I need to get rid of that malevolent worm, Umbridge.' Harry clenched his jaw. 'Once she's gone, I can find the prophecy and learn whatever it says, then destroy or steal whatever people are dying over in the Department of Mysteries, too.'

*He means dead, not gone.* She could see the ice in his eyes.

*He's going to kill her.*

'Gone?' Images of Harry flanked by aurors, wandless and

shackled, swarmed through Fleur's thoughts and her voice shook.

Harry froze, every muscle tensing. 'I think you know.'

She took a deep breath and banished the thoughts. 'Do *not* get caught.' Fleur tightened her grip on his hair. 'Do not get caught throwing out Dumbledore. Do not get caught killing this horrible witch. Do not get caught breaking into the Ministry. And do not get caught afterward.' She rested her forehead against his. 'You are *mine*. Heart, mind, body, and soul. I'm not sharing any of those with anything or anyone, let alone one of those terrible creatures in Azkaban.'

'I'd really rather not spend any time with them, either.'

*He speaks like they're some annoying family relation. He's*

*no proper concept of danger at all.*

Fleur huffed. 'In fact. I don't trust you not to do something stupid. I am coming with you.'

'No.' Something close to panic crept into Harry's tone. 'You

*can't*.'

'I can and I will.'

'Fleur,' he whispered. '*Please.* I need to know you're safe

and waiting. I *need* it.'

She let go of him and crossed her arms. 'I will be safe and waiting and *with you*.'

'Please, Fleur.' An awful emptiness loomed in Harry's eyes. 'I can't lose you. I can't even *risk* losing you. *Never.* There's nothing else I have if you're gone.'

*Ah.* A twist of guilt pierced through Fleur. *Of course. You would see it like that, wouldn't you, monCœur? One perfect wish for a boy who never got anything else.*

'Fine.' She jabbed a finger into chest. 'Fine. I understand. I don't like it, but I will wait. And you, you will *come back*.' Fleur swallowed hard. 'Because it is not so different for me, either.'

# One in the Chamber

A clear, crisp sky hung over the Great Hall. Faint wisps of winter cloud drifted across it above a scatter of students and teachers. Harry sliced his chicken and leek pie into bite-sized pieces, arranging them in a neat row across his plate.

Katie plopped down on the bench beside him. 'Heya, Harry!'

*Not avoiding me, then.*

\'I thought you were meant to be at home for Christmas?\' he

asked.

\'I came back. Angelina and Alicia were taking their plans for

my well-being a bit *too* far, so I told them I'd go home when they did. I went home, had a *really* interesting conversation with my parents, and came back today.\'

Harry grimaced. *She seems happy, though. It can't have*

*been too bad.*

\'What did your parents say?\'

\'They cancelled their subscription to the Daily Prophet.\' Katie beamed. \'Dad told me that I could go out with whomever I damn well pleased as long as he was kind, good-looking, rich, and polite.\'

\'Good,\' Harry said. \'It\'s about time more people realised how kind, good-looking, and polite I am.\'

Katie giggled. \'Are you rich? Should I warn Daddy that I might have found someone who has designs on his darling daughter and fits his criteria?\'

\'I have a trust fund,\' Harry said. \'My family's old and pure- blooded apparently, but I actually have no idea.\'

\'I guess it doesn\'t really matter until you\'re seventeen and

emancipated.'

\'Voldemort will have killed me long before then. It\'s not going to be a problem.\'

She thumped him on the arm and scowled. \'Don\'t joke about

things like that.'

Harry feigned a bow. \'Yes, Dark Mistress.'

\'Good boy.\' Katie patted him on the cheek, then glanced up and down the table. 'How's Frenchie? Did she get upset over the article?'

Harry shook his head. 'She's fine.' He screwed his face up. 'Well, she didn't say anything, so she's not *that* upset, but I doubt she liked it.'

'As long as the two of you are happy.' Katie stole a piece of pie from his plate. 'Frenchie seemed kind of haughty, so I was worried she'd get mad and try to get back at you.'

Harry glanced down at the willow ring. 'Yes, I suspect she

has.'

'You think she's going to try and start something with

someone else to make you jealous?' Katie whispered.

A point of ice clenched beneath Harry's ribs. 'No. She'd *never* do that. She gave me this.' He waggled his right forefinger at her. 'Told me to wear it where everyone would see it...'

'Everyone being me,' Katie murmured. 'I see.'

Harry finished his pie in slow, measured mouthfuls. \'Did you like your present, then? If you're back, you must've found it.\'

Katie gave him a wide grin. \'Oh, yes, but you ought to be careful, if you keep giving a girl things like *that*, then she\'s going to start thinking you want to be more than just friends.\'

\'Just don\'t tell Rita Skeeter,\' Harry muttered. \'No, it's good. I can\'t use it and I\'m sure it was only a matter of time until Umbridge tried to confiscate it. Better I lend it to you.\'

\'I might not give it back even if your lifetime ban gets wiped away,\' Katie said.

\'I knew I should've made you sign something in blood...' \'For a Firebolt I would've signed almost anything, too.' A

wicked gleam appeared in her eyes. 'If you thought I was willing to

do *whatever* you wanted to get out of a trick step, you've *no idea*

what I'd do for a boy who gave me a Firebolt.'

\'Well, if you\'re willing...\' Harry fished a scrap of parchment out of his pocket. \'We can write something up? How does eternal slavery sound?\'

\'To you?\' Katie gave him a coy look and bit her lip. \'Do I get to call you *Dark Master?*\'

Harry chuckled. 'If you want.'

Black ink marked the parchment beneath his fingers. *Rita Skeeter's address.* Harry read it once, then slipped it back into his pocket. *That's close to Diagon Alley, I saw that street name on the way there with Uncle Vernon.*

\'It\'s a shame you already gave it to me for the foreseeable future.' Katie gave him a shrug. 'Guess you'll have to lure me into the trick step after all.'

\'You\'d've been a terrible slave anyway.' He put his knife and fork down. 'I can't say I like the sneakoscope you gave me, though. It seemed cool to begin with, but it whistles *constantly.*'

Katie laughed. \'Been doing untrustworthy things, have you?'

\'Every other second of every day?\' Harry asked. \'It starts

whenever I get near it. Even when I'm *sleeping.*\'

\'What did Nev get you?\' Katie asked. \'I know you bought him that really rare, unpronounceable cactus. He sent me a letter that had the damn thing's name twice in every sentence. It took me hours to read without tying my tongue in a knot.\'

\'MimbulusMimbletonia.\' Harry extended his forearm and tugged up the sleeve of his robes to reveal the slim, dragon-hide duelling holster his wand was now in. \'He got me this. Aurors use them, I think.\'

\'Cool,\' she exclaimed. \'How does it work?\'

\'It's enchanted. I flick my wrist and think about wanting my

wand in my hand...' He did so and his wand appeared in his grasp.

\'What happens if you don\'t catch it?\'

\'I drop my wand and look like an idiot. Presumably, I also lose whatever duel I was about to fight in.' He grinned. 'No, it's enchanted so it literally appears in my grasp. I don't think I *can* drop it.'

*It was probably fairly expensive.* Harry glanced at the clock.

*Time to get Fleur. I did promise.*

\'Enjoy your lunch,\' he said.

\'Leaving me already?\' Katie pouted. 'That's not nice, I only

just got back.'

\'I've a promise to keep.\' A small smile crept onto his lips. 'Frenchie, then.' She busied herself with a goblet and a jug.

\'You only smile like that when you\'re sneaking off to see her.\'

'Guilty as charged.'

Katie thwacked the jug back down. 'Well, off you go, then.

I'll see you later.'

Harry slipped back toward the Chamber of Secrets through empty corridors. Silence hung over Myrtle's bathroom, so he stepped over the puddle and hurried down into the chamber.

\'I thought you were spending the rest of the day with Fleur,\' Salazar said.

\'I am, but we\'ve been together for six months. It\'s about time she met my family, don\'t you think?\'

Salazar drummed his fingers on the top of his snake's head. \'You\'ve never referred to your muggle relatives as your family before\... You intend to bring her here.\'

\'You're the only real family I have, painting or not. Nobody else helped me like family is meant to.' He studied the golden sand in the time-turner. 'And I promised Fleur no more secrets.\'

\'Well, I don't remember Tom ever bringing a girl to meet me.\' Shadows clustered in Salazar's eyes. 'Actually, I don't remember him ever really speaking to one.'

\'Do you think it\'s a bad idea?\' Harry asked. 'I trust her. She won't betray me.'

\'No, I think it\'s a very good idea.' Salazar's green eyes softened. 'However, without our bloodline, she can only enter here by invitation.\'

\'Then how could Ginny, Ron, Lockhart, Fawkes...\' Harry sighed. 'I invited them all in, didn't I? I intended or wanted them to enter.'

'The Weasley girl was possessed by Tom, so that likely counted in her case.' Salazar peeled his snake off his neck and coiled it round his arm. 'As for the phoenix, they\'re annoying creatures, interpreting odd meanings from anything if it benefits them. Helga\'s once came to give me aid in the middle of a feast, it relit the fire when it went out, but I\'m certain it was just hungry and wanted an excuse to get past the wards to the food.\'

\'So I can just apparate us both here?\'

\'Yes.\' Salazar sighed. \'I need to teach you a lot more about the magic of the Chamber of Secrets.\'

\'You\'ve taught me next to nothing about it.\'

Salazar's expression darkened. \'I know. I will soon. Go on, then, Harry. You have my permission, approval, or whatever it was you wanted from telling me.\'

Harry picked up Fleur's drawing. 'Argent.'

Gabby sat on the white pebbles, tossing the small ones into the water and watching the ripples spread.

\'Fleur! You\'ve shrunk!\'

Gabby twisted 'round, a brief shadow of a smile passing across her lips. \'Fleur's in her room at the chateau.' She chose another pebble and threw it into the middle of the current.

*I know that smile. A younger version of me wore it when he saw the other children with their parents.*

Harry watched the fish scatter from the ripples. \'Lonely?\'

'It's part of being veela.' Gabby sighed. 'I imagine we all think we'll be different, that our friends are better, but they're not. Girls like boys' attention. They don't like it when it's suddenly snatched away.' She lobbed another stone into the water. \'And you\'ve stolen my sister, so I don't have Fleur to spend my time with instead.'

\'Sorry.' Harry took a seat on the shore beside her. \'I didn\'t

intend to steal her from you.\'

\'I don\'t mind,' Gabby murmured. \'It's good Fleur has you.

She smiles properly a lot more now.\'

\'I\'m sure she\'ll come and kidnap you.' Harry bumped her shoulder with his. 'And if she doesn't, I'll try to. Just don't tell Fleur, ok? She'll think we're finally eloping.'

A quiet laugh burst from Gabby's lips. 'Thank you, Harry. I think you'll both be busy, though. And I'm not the same as Fleur. She's stronger than I am. I can\'t ignore everyone around me as easily as she does. I can feel their emotions in the magic they cast, their

jealousy, their pity, their anger.\' Her fingers tightened on the pebble in her palm. \'They affect me.\'

\'If there's anything I can do, you only have to ask,\' Harry

promised.

Gabby shook her head. 'I will survive. Maman says it's just a few years. Once the other girls have grown up a bit more, they start to see past things.'

'She probably knows.'

Gabby nodded. 'She's not as powerful as me and nowhere near as powerful as Fleur, but she probably does know.' A glimmer of her usual mischief appeared in her eyes. \'My sister's been waiting for you very impatiently since Christmas, what *did* you promise her?\'

Harry chuckled. 'Well, if you want to find out, you can try following us and making another picture?'

\'I think Fleur really might murder me.\' Gabby giggled, stood up, and stuck her arm out. \'Can you apparate me back? Fleur added you to the wards.\'

\'Of course.' Harry took her hand and spun the world back past them with a soft snap. He kept a tight grip on Gabby until they stood still amidst her hoard of shoes. 'There we go.'

\'Thanks.\' She flashed him a grin. \'I\'ll get Fleur for you.\' Gabby bounced up the stairs, calling Fleur\'s name and casting all sorts of aspersions on what they might be about to do.

Harry shook his head and grinned as faint blue light flickered down the stairs. A pink-cheeked Fleur appeared, trailed by a soot-streaked Gabby.

'Keeping your promise?' she asked.

Gabby giggled.

'Not like *that.'* Fleur trod on Gabby's foot. 'Maman needs to take the adult bits out of those books.'

'But they're the best bits! You even folded all the corners of the pages down to mark them, Fleur!'

Fleur's face turned bright red. 'You're *dead.*'

Gabby bolted for the kitchen with a squeal.

'Well, that sounded *interesting.'* Harry offered his hand.

'Want to tell me about it?'

'Tell you? Non.' Fleur stepped right against him and wrapped her arms round him. The heat of her pressed into him from her knees to her breasts. 'But one day, monCœur, I might *show* you.'

Harry choked. 'Well---'

'I think you like the idea.' A smirk settled on Fleur's lips and she pushed her hips against him a little more. 'In fact, I can tell you like the idea a lot.'

Heat rushed to Harry's cheeks. 'Right, off we go.'

He pictured the oversized bust of his ancestor and the serpent effigies of the main chamber, holding tight to Fleur as the world swirled past them. Harry went sprawling across cold, hard stone, pulling Fleur after him. 'How do I always end up on the floor?'

She sat up and straddled him. \'I think this method of apparition works well.' Her smirk returned. 'So do you, it seems, monCœur.'

Harry sat up and kissed her. 'I'm sure if I wanted to find out,

I'd find you like it a lot, too.'

'Perhaps...' Fleur rolled her hips and Harry's breath caught as she pressed herself against him. \'But not now.' She jumped to her feet. 'Where is this?\'

*Tease.*

\'The Chamber of Secrets.'

\'Is it actually called that?\' Fleur wrinkled her nose. \'And I don\'t know what that means.\'

\'The wizard who named it had a few issues with his ego.\' Harry pointed at the giant bust of Salazar Slytherin.

\'I heard that.\' Salazar's parseltongue hiss echoed from the

study.

Harry.'

Fleur tensed at the sound. 'I don't particularly like snakes,

Harry chuckled. 'No snakes. Well, no real ones.' He waved a

hand at the décor. \'The Chamber of Secrets was built by Salazar Slytherin to house a guardian to protect the school from attackers. It slumbered here until his descendant was able to enter the chamber, but Voldemort had his own purpose for it and set the basilisk on the students instead.\'

\'Who puts a basilisk in a school full of children?\' Fleur

demanded. Her face paled. 'It's not still here, is it?'

He laughed. \'I asked the same question, and no, it\'s gone. In my second year, Voldemort managed to unleash it on the school

again; it petrified Hermione, one of my friends at the time, and dragged Ginny Weasley down here.\'

\'You went after it. Of *course* you did.'

\'I came down here and I killed it with a sword in a very dashing, heroic manner.\'

Salazar's painting muttered something that sounded a lot

like *brainless Godricness.*

Fleur scowled. \'That explains why Ginny Weasley likes you. I guess there was *some* truth in that article about you, her, and Katie Bell.'

Harry winced and pointed at the faint, seventy-foot shadow. \'There\'s not much left of the basilisk. It was taking up too much space.\'

*\'Merde*,\' Fleur whispered. \'You're such an idiot, anyone less

lucky would've died.\'

\'He nearly did,\' Salazar called. 'The idiot was bitten and had to be saved by phoenix tears. Fortunately, he's far less keen to play the hero these days.\'

Fleur flicked her silver hair over her shoulder. 'Who is that, monCœur?'

\'My ancestor,\' Harry replied. \'His painting hangs on the wall through there, presumably to perpetually irritate all of his descendants who find his Chamber of Secrets.\'

\'You\'re descended from *Salazar Slytherin?*\'

'Without a doubt.' Harry led her into the study. 'I'd imagine it's complicated, otherwise everyone would know.'

\'This is where you got the books from.'

\'Yes.\' Harry waved a hand at the shelves. \'My Latin's pretty poor, but I know enough to get by and most of them were helpfully translated by my predecessor.\'

\'So this is Fleur,\' Salazar said. \'It\'s a pleasure to meet you face to face.\'

'In the flesh, so to speak,' Harry quipped.

'*Brat*.' Salazar folded his arms. 'Even this paint and canvas shadow is a greater wizard than you.'

Fleur glanced between the two of them. 'I can't see too many similarities.'

\'There aren\'t many,\' Salazar said. \'He has my wife and daughter\'s nose, there's a little of me in his cheekbones and jaw, and perhaps the colour of the hair, but little else.\'

\'It has been over a thousand years,' Harry said.

\'So this is where you kept sneaking off to last year.' Fleur picked the time-turner up and inspected it with a faint frown. \'No wonder I could never figure out where you were going.\'

'Were you following me the *entire time?*' Harry asked.

'I was curious.' Fleur turned her nose up. 'You ought to have been more curious, then you would've come and talked to me sooner.'

'It does explain where Gabby learnt her stalking behaviour from.' Harry shrugged. 'You wouldn't have been able to get past the wards, anyway.'

Salazar rolled his eyes. \'The chamber is protected by blood magic wards. You have to be a blood relation to me, or invited by one, to enter my chamber.\'

\'Are there any others?\' Fleur asked. \'Just one,\' Harry muttered. \'Voldemort.'

\'He will not be visiting, he hasn't in a very long time,\' Salazar said. 'And we will seal him out soon.'

\'So, is this the last of your secrets?\' Harry gave her a broad grin.

\'I didn\'t think so.'

'You'd get bored of me if it was.\'

'I would not.' Fleur crossed her arms. 'You would only make more secrets, anyway, monCœur.'

'Well, I can't share some of the last ones unless you can protect your thoughts.'

Salazar nodded. 'Occlumency.'

Fleur nodded. \'I am passable. It\'s a requirement for applying to Les Inconnus and the Bureau d\'Éngimes. My magic helps as well, the natural pull of it affects the mental connection. It is hard for most wizards to manipulate my thoughts with such a handicap.'

\'Could you defend your thoughts if someone tried to steal from them?\' Harry asked.

'Of course.' She shook her hair down. 'Maybe not against the most skilled wizards and witches, but the allure's pull gives me a big advantage.'

\'Avoid Albus Dumbledore and Voldemort, and it'll be fine,\'

Salazar said. \'I assume this is the discussion about horcruxes.\'

\'Well if it wasn\'t, it\'s going to be now, isn\'t it, you annoying paint-blotch?\' Harry glowered at the painting.

\'So I\'m right either way, then.' A smug smile spread over Salazar's face.

Fleur blinked and cocked her head. \'What are horcruxes?\'

'Complicated.' Harry frowned. 'A very abstract piece of soul- based magic, but basically an anchor to the world. If you have one, you can't be killed, even if your body's destroyed.'

'So that's how Voldemort survived.' Fleur picked up the time-turner and inspected the tiny runes etched into it. 'We need to destroy it, then.'

'There's been more than one,' Salazar said. 'But I think there's probably only a couple left. Tom would've chosen a magically potent number, probably three.'

\'The prophecy's just the first step,\' Harry murmured. 'A powerful wizard trying to kill a baby after hearing a prophecy that involves him? I doubt Voldemort is going to stop trying to kill me.\'

\'What do we do?\' Fleur demanded. Salazar laughed.

Harry scowled at him. \'I need to see the prophecy and I need to get the Ministry to accept the truth before Voldemort launches a

surprise attack and crushes the majority of his opposition. It will get a

bit tricky if it's just me against the entire country.\'

\'*We*.' Fleur's blue eyes darkened by a few shades.

Harry's heart twisted. Chill fingers clamped 'round his spine and his stomach churned. 'You *promised*.\'

\'It is still *our* goal.'

'Well, *our* goal is to be stronger than Dumbledore and Voldemort, but they\'re so far beyond what I can do, I wonder if I'll even have time to get there.\'

\'Why do you need to be stronger than *Dumbledore*?\' Fleur asked. \'Is he not on your side?\'

\'He believes I'm part of his side.\' A bitter heat crept onto Harry's tongue. 'But like with all his pawns, he's just waiting for the best time to trade pieces.\'

Her eyes darkened to midnight blue. \'We should duel, then.\' A small smirk curved Fleur's lips and she strode from the study. \'Let's see how long you last against me before you start thinking about Dumbledore or Voldemort.'

\'Proud, isn\'t she?\' Salazar said.

\'With good reason.' Harry shrugged. 'I kind of like it.' Salazar stroked the head of his snake. 'Oh, just *kind of?*' 'Shut up.'

Salazar laughed. 'She's good for you.' He waved a hand at Harry. 'Now go spend some time with her. She's more important than talking with some dusty old painting.'

Fleur stood in the centre of the chamber, her rosewood wand held upright before her face like a blade. 'I almost thought you'd decided to forfeit...'

'As if I'd miss the chance to beat you at something.' Harry pointed at the serpent effigies. 'Don't worry about breaking anything. It fixes up easily.'

\'Normal rules.\' Fleur drew a glowing circle in the air with the tip of her wand, then tossed it over the floor like a loop of ribbon; it stretched out to seven metres. \'Nothing too dangerous and no saying anything but spells.\'

Her wand snapped up. Harry flicked his into his palm. \'Good reflexes. Did you do the other ritual?\'

\'I haven\'t done that yet,\' Harry said. 'I should soon, but I don't want Madam Pomfrey talking to Dumbledore, and the rituals kind of take it out of you.\'

\'Shall we begin?\' Fleur raised her wand.

Harry mirrored her. *Let's see if I can't beat her again.* He smothered a smile. *She'll pout so much.*

Fleur unleashed a trio of red jinxes, twirling the wand motions together. Harry deflected two of them back and side- stepped the last. He threw all the useless school hexes he'd taught Nev at her. She danced through them, redirecting a few back at him, turning and twisting him along the perimeter of the circle, testing his deflection to its limit.

Harry sent his spells hissing from the tip of his wand as fast as he could manage. Fleur's spells ricocheted and burst against his hail of magic, but she bent, leant, and swayed through the storm,

batting away anything that came close to her. Her silver hair billowed as she folded in half at the waist, then bounced back up off her palm and swatted away another jinx.

*She's really flexible.* Harry tore his eyes away and ducked a couple of his own spells. *Focus. If I lose because I was staring at her, she'll never let me forget it.*

He switched tactics, sending spells slicing past Fleur's shoulder and forcing her closer to him along the edge of the ring. She scowled, then smirked and released a flash of light from her wand.

Harry's spells hung amidst a faint shimmer, caught in it like

flies in a web. *What the hell is that?*

Fleur side-stepped 'round it and sent a yellow spell hissing at him. Harry ducked and felt it sear through his hair. Her laughter floated after half a dozen more yellow spells.

He batted the first two away, and let the others whistle past. *Plan B, then.*

Harry animated the effigies along the walls, pouring magic into them, then shielded, weathering Fleur's barrage of spells and keeping his distance, backing along the outside of the ring. The stone snakes curled around Fleur's legs and she gasped, thrusting her glowing wand tip at them. The marble coils tightened and she scowled, lashing out with her wand and turning them to dust.

*Damn.* He hurled a few more jinxes. *Okay, new plan.*

He conjured his swarm of butterflies and unleashed a stream of transfigured projectiles at Fleur, forcing her to throw up a shield of her own. Harry drew the water from the pool behind Fleur into a basilisk and coiled it about her shield until the pressure burst

the shining white bubble. A flash of bright flame severed the basilisk and Fleur dived through.

\'Expelliarmus,\' Harry murmured, snatching Fleur's wand out

of the air and waving it aloft.

Bright blue flashed before his eyes and a burst of heat struck his chest, knocking him out of the circle and across the floor.

\'I do not need my wand to conjure fire, monCœur.' Fleur waved a hand coated in azure flames at him and wiggled her fire- wreathed fingers.

\'I'd already disarmed you and won.' Harry dusted himself off and stood up. \'You said normal rules, so that includes no sneaky veela attacks.\'

Fleur scowled, then shrugged. \'So what did you think?\' he asked.

\'What do I think?\' A huge pout crept onto her lips. \'I am a talented duellist, eighteen, and did the best I could, but I still got overpowered by a fifteen year old. It\'s *annoying*.'

Harry shot her a helpless look.

\'I'm not angry with you, monCœur.' She stepped forward and gave him a gentle kiss on the cheek. 'I just don't like losing.\'

\'So I did well?\'

Fleur waved her wand at the fragments of the serpents and restored the chamber. \'I use a counter-attacking style. I don't have the brute force to break through the strongest defences, but I can dodge, deflect, and defend very well. It's effective in the ring and more

effective outside it when I've more room, but I only created *one*

opening. *It's frustrating.*'

\'That\'s pretty much how I felt while watching you weave around everything I did, no matter how fast I tried to go.' He wrapped his hands 'round her waist. 'And whatever you did to *freeze* my spells.'

'Wards.' Fleur smirked. 'I am good with wards, I think the right way for them.'

'Salazar says I'm good at abstract magic, like blood, soul, and mind magic.\' He smiled. 'Salazar expects all his descendants to be good at the same things he was, though.'

'And transfiguration.' Fleur sighed. 'I tried to turn your serpents back on you by re-enchanting them, but imbuing my magic over yours was like pouring water onto glass.'

'Is Gabby good at wards?'

Fleur nodded. 'She is good at nearly all the same things as me, but she has a... *softer* touch. It works better for some things and not others, depending on the intent of the magic. Her enchantments play nicer with other people than mine.'

Harry conjured a seat for them and settled into it.

Fleur draped herself over his lap. 'What now?'

'Well, I'm going to talk to Rita Skeeter tomorrow, I'm sure you remember her...'

'Oh yes,' she muttered. 'I remember *her*. She deserves anything and everything that happens to her. Such a spiteful, petty, shallow little girl.'

\'She\'s an animagus and likely an unregistered one.' Harry slipped his wand away and ran his fingers through Fleur's silver tresses. 'I owe her for that article about Katie and Ginny. Potshots at me I can ignore, but that was a step too far. I'm going to twist her arm into doing something more useful, like raising awareness about Voldemort's return or discrediting his followers in the Ministry.\'

\'I am coming,\' Fleur said. 'I promised not to come when it was dangerous, but I'm *definitely* coming this time.'

Harry wrestled with the sharp, tight, cold fingers clutching

at his heart. 'But...'

'But what?' Fleur twisted in his lap and glared up at him.

'It\'s not worth the *risk*. If things go wrong, you might get hurt, or worse. Your actions would have huge repercussions for your family and nobody knows you're connected to me yet, so you're completely safe so long as you aren't seen with me again.\'

Her eyes narrowed a fraction and darkened a few shades. \'Then I will come with you under your cloak and nobody will know.\'

Harry wrestled with the fear, but caught the unyielding gleam in her near-black eyes. \'You can come, but you have to promise me you'll stay hidden.'

She pursed her lips. \'Fine. I promise.\'

\'Thank you.\' Harry bent and kissed her on the cheek. 'I *know*

you hate it, but I *need* you to be safe.'

\'I won\'t keep promising things like this.' Fleur's eyes shifted a few hues darker still. \'I refuse to hide while you take all the risks. I am not some sunset for you to walk toward. We will walk there *together*.\'

'I'd have to be an idiot to refuse the help of a witch like you

every time.\'

\'You are an idiot,\' Fleur muttered. \'You tried to kill a basilisk with a *sword*.\'

Harry chuckled. \'In my defence, I didn\'t have my wand.'

Fleur let out a peal of laughter. \'When are we going tomorrow?\'

\'Probably in the evening.' Harry shrugged. 'It doesn't matter.' 'Do you even go to your lessons? Don't you ever have

something important to do at school?'

\'Well...\' Harry eyed her from head to toe. 'I can think of *one*

thing...'

Pink blossomed on Fleur's cheeks. \'Be careful, monCœur.

I'm going to take you up on that sooner or later...\'

'I'm fairly sure you're meant to wait until I'm sixteen, cradle-

robber.'

Fleur laughed. 'I'm not the cradle-robber you need to be

worrying about, it's the one who gave you this scar who's the threat.' She traced the line of it down his forehead with her fingertip. 'It's faded now, less red. I think it may disappear completely.'

'The rituals, maybe.'

*Or when I tore my soul.*

'Mmm.' Fleur closed her eyes and huffed her hair off her face. 'I'm going to take a nap. You can run your fingers through my hair, if you like. It feels nice.'

Harry chuckled and slipped his hands through her hair, massaging the back of her neck.

'Warming charm please, monTrésor,' Fleur murmured.

He laughed. 'Of course, mon Rêve.' He cast the spell upon his hands, then cradled her head in his lap. 'Better?'

'Much better.' She nestled close and tucked her knees up

into his side. 'Now hush, this is nice.'

# The Interview

Diagon Alley's heaving crowd bustled past the front of Ollivander's shop. Red umbrellas fluttered to Harry's right in a faint, cool breeze.

Fleur squeezed his fingers. 'Mon Cœur?' she whispered. 'This way,' Harry murmured. 'Skeeter's smart. She lives in

the middle of London where nobody can openly retaliate against her

articles without getting into a lot of trouble for messing with

muggles.'

Fleur huffed against his neck. 'She's not smart. She's a bitter little girl with a crayon, a column and a grudge.'

He laughed, leading her from Ollivander's out of Diagon Alley and into muggle London. 'Well, she's going to get her just desserts soon.'

They weaved through the gaggles of muggles on the pavement. Harry tracked the street names on his right as they went.

\'She won\'t be there when we arrive, will she?\' Fleur whispered.

\'I'm not sure.' Harry ducked an enthusiastic tourist's arm and

tugged Fleur down out of the way. 'Have you seen the street?'

\'There,\' Fleur hissed. \'Where I\'m pointing.\' Harry snickered. \'We\'re *invisible*, Fleur.\'

\'Eleven o\'clock. And *stop* laughing at me, I forgot.\'

Harry pressed his free hand over his mouth to stifle his chuckles and started toward Rita Skeeter\'s street. *Now, where's number five?*

The number five hung on the lime-green door of a modest house a few down the identical row. A neat lawn surrounded a small, stone birdbath, and potted shrubs and flowers bloomed beneath the white-painted window sills.

Harry pulled his cloak out and covered the two of them, then opened the gate and crept along the path to the door. He hopped over the step and paused before the threshold. \'Diffindo,\' he muttered, running the tip of his wand along the edge of the frame.

The lock gave with a soft metallic click.

Harry pushed the door open and cast a quick revealing charm. 'Nobody's home, but stay under the cloak just in case, mon Rêve.'

Soft, thick carpet spread across small neat rooms decorated with comfortable, colourful furniture and piled with stacks of magazines and papers. Framed articles hung on all the walls.

'I will go this way.' Fleur's footsteps drifted off to the left

and upstairs.

Harry dispelled his disillusionment and explored the lower rooms. A chipped, worn set of china lay behind the kitchen cupboards and a tub of cake sat beside the sink.

\'Harry,\' Fleur hissed in his ear.

A cold rush coursed through his veins. Harry glowered at

the source of Fleur's quiet laughter.

\'I found a whole cabinet of files upstairs, come see.\'

Harry followed the sound of her steps up the stairs to a short corridor with a small, crackling fireplace between a well-lit office and Skeeter's bedroom.

Fleur's foot impressions paused beside a towering cabinet. 'It was well-warded, but not well enough warded to keep *me* out.'

Harry skimmed through the drawers, flicking through an endless list of names and thick folders. He pulled Lucius Malfoy's out and thumbed through it. \'Perfect...'

\'Make her write an article about all the Death Eaters in here,\' Fleur suggested.

'She'd never agree,' he said. 'Not if she thought it'd ever see the light of day.'

*But if she didn't, then she might.* Harry weighed things up.

*And if the article was found under dramatic circumstances...*

He turned to Fleur. 'I'll have to---'

The light from the flames in the corridor flared green. *The floo. She's coming back.* A fist of panic clamped 'round Harry's heart. *Nobody must know about Fleur.*

\'Go!' Harry hissed. 'Go, Fleur. I'll see you in a few minutes in

France. Go now, *please*.'

The cloak whispered to the floor. Harry picked it up, folded it away beneath his robes, and stepped out into the corridor to lean against the wall. He smothered his fading panic, dragging up the memory of Katie's tears and letting the little ball of ice tighten in his chest.

Rita Skeeter stepped out of the flames, dusting off her lime- green jacket and cream blouse.

\'Rita.\' Harry offered her a small smile. 'Welcome home.'

She quirked an eyebrow. \'Mr Potter, this is most unexpected.

Illegal, too.\'

\'Now, now, Rita. Don\'t go throwing stones from your glass

house.\'

\'Muggle phrases. I\'m afraid I don\'t understand.\'

Harry's smile spread a little wider. \'I believe they sentence

unregistered animagi to Azkaban, don\'t they?\'

Her eyes narrowed. \'You must have proof to make an open allegation like that and not fear being laughed at even more than you already are.'

\'I wouldn't be here if I thought it might go wrong,\' Harry lied. \'I was hoping we might come to an arrangement.\'

Rita's lips thinned. \'What sort?\'

\'The sort where you write a highly controversial article and I keep your secret,\' Harry replied. \'The article will even have the benefit of being true, for once. The novelty may amuse you, Rita.\'

\'Who would you like me to enlighten my readers about, Mr

Potter?\'

\'There\'s a whole list of very interesting files in that cabinet. I

had a brief read through and I think Mr Malfoy would make a very nice subject for you.\'

to me.\'

\'No. Definitely not.\' Rita shook her head. \'Not worth the risk

*Of course not.* Harry forced himself to frown. *So now some*

*bait. Good bait.*

\'How about you write the article, then I will swear an oath, an Unbreakable Vow, to never mention your little secret again before I leave. Would that assurance be worthwhile?\'

Rita Skeeter\'s eyes gleamed and she stepped across to catch his hand in between hers. \'We have a deal. I don\'t particularly want to spend any time in Azkaban.\'

\'I\'ve heard it\'s an unpleasant place,\' Harry said. \'Now, the

article?\'

\'Of course.\' Rita's smile turned into a wolfish grin, and her

acid-green quill rose from the pocket of her jacket with her note-pad and began to scribble away. \'Perhaps you\'d like some cake while I write?\'

\'That would be lovely.\' Harry trailed her to the kitchen. 'I fear I'm slowly developing a sweet tooth.'

\'Pound cake.\' Rita cut a generous slice and passed it across on a small plate. \'A personal favourite of mine, actually.\'

Harry took a bite and let the sweet sponge dissolve on his tongue. \'It\'s very good. Is it homemade?\'

*Fleur would like this.*

\'Yes.\' A touch of genuine pride coloured Rita\'s tone. 'I always wanted to be a baker, you know, but there's not much of a market for simple cakes in the magical world.'

\'I\'m impressed.\' Harry laughed. \'There\'s a hidden side to Britain\'s most feared journalist.\'

\'To you as well it seems, Harry.\' She watched him finish his cake with a curious gleam in her eyes. \'How *did* you get in undetected?\'

\'Now *that* would be telling. Rest assured your wards aren't flawed, I simply found a way to bypass them. There aren\'t many wards that can keep me out if I really need to get in.\'

\'How fascinating,\' Rita murmured. Her quill drifted to write upon paper headed with the Daily Prophet\'s title. 'Almost done, Harry.'

\'May I see?\'

\'Of course.\' Rita watched her quill finish its line, then passed him the sheet.

Harry skimmed the piece. *Death Eater. Imperius Curse.*

*Murder. Rape. Torture.* He put it down and brushed the crumbs back onto the plate. *This will do just fine.*

\'How scathing. It\'s perfect.\'

\'And now for your side of our deal, Harry.' Rita's eyes glittered. 'You owe me a vow.'

Harry finished his cake and set the plate down. 'My house elf will suffice as an intelligent magical witness. He'll be indirectly bound by my oath, too, that way.'

Rita's grin broadened. 'An excellent idea.'

\'Dobby,\' he called.

sir?'

Dobby materialised with a loud crack. 'Master Harry Potter,

\'I need you to witness an oath for me, Dobby,\' Harry said.

\'It\'s very important.\'

\'Dobby will not disappoint Master Harry Potter.'

Harry drew his wand and passed it to Dobby. \'Just hold it

there, Dobby, I'll do the rest. Now, what are your terms, Rita?\'

Rita reached forward and clasped his right hand with hers. 'Will you, Harry Potter, agree to never speak of my animagus abilities again?\'

\'I will.\'

A tendril of white magic flared from the tip of his wand to encircle their hands. A cold chill crept down his spine as the magic tightened about him like a noose. He closed his eyes and pictured their magic weaving together like threads to form the rope about his neck.

\'Will you, Harry Potter, agree never to break into any property I own, or into anything that contains my belongings?\' Rita asked.

\'I will.\'

A second tendril joined the first.

She released his hand. \'That's sufficient. You have your

article written and I have my assurance.\'

\'I\'ll be leaving, then,\' Harry said. \'It was nice doing business with you.\'

Rita's grin spread from ear to ear. 'Bye, Harry. Keep an eye

on the paper tomorrow. I think the article will be a *fantastic* read.'

Harry chuckled. 'Yes, I suspect it will be, Rita.' He slipped his wand out. 'However, there is one *last* thing... Morsmordre*.'*

The serpent and skull tore the top storey and roof from the house. Tiles, wood, and stone hailed down onto the kitchen floor, and dust clouded the air.

Harry swept it all away with a flick of his wand.

A smoke serpent writhed through the empty sockets of the skull and eerie green light flickered across the sky above them.

Rita gasped. \'The Dark Mark...' Her eyes darted to the article then back to him, her face draining of all colour. 'Wait!'

'Wait?' Harry asked.

\'Your vow---\'

'Will bind me so long as Dobby lives. Perhaps you ought to have chosen your words more carefully, Rita.' He gave her a thin, cold smile. 'But then again, that's why I'm here in the first place, isn't it?'

*You shouldn't have written such horrible things about Fleur*

*or Katie.*

She scrambled for her wand.

*One perfect wish.* Harry pictured the sunset beyond the

leaves of the willow tree and embraced the ice within. Pettigrew's blank eyes drifted through thoughts of French sun and his wand turned hot in his hand. *Whatever it takes.*

\'Avada kedavra,' he whispered.

A bright green flash lit the kitchen. Rita slumped to the floor and her lime-feathered quill drifted down onto the tiles.

Harry stared down at her blank eyes and waited for something to rise up inside. His stomach remained still and his heart's pounding slowed to its usual beat. *She hurt countless people. Like Fleur said, she deserves everything she gets.*

He closed his eyes and *listened.*

Whispers rose up around him. The subtle susurration of soft screams. A handful of pairs of cold green eyes stared back from within and the reflection of a crimson sun sank down below the world's edge in every pair.

*My perfect wish.* Harry released a deep sigh. *And my soul's healing, so I can't be a horcrux any longer.*

'Fleur's going to be angry.' He glanced 'round the kitchen, then summoned the plate of pound cake. 'Maybe the cake will buy me a head start.'

Loud cracks echoed from the street below.

*Aurors.* Harry pictured the willow tree and twisted the world back past him until he stood beneath its branches.

Fleur swung her feet from their branch.

He glanced up into her pitch-black eyes. 'Merde.' 'Merde indeed,' she hissed.

Harry winced and held up the plate. 'I brought you cake?' Fleur's eyes narrowed, then she held out her hand. '*Give*.'

Harry levitated the plate up to her.

She vanished the plastic, then took a huge bite out of the remaining thick slice of pound cake. Crumbs spilt down her chest and showered onto the willow roots. 'It's good.' Fleur's eyes shifted to dark blue as she finished it in small, swift bites. 'But you're *not* forgiven, monCœur.'

'I'm sorry,' he said. 'I panicked.'

Fleur huffed and dusted crumbs from her fingers. 'You *panicked.*' She dropped from the branch with a soft thud. 'I faced a *dragon*. You think some spiteful bitch of a reporter scares me?'

'No. I know she doesn't.' Harry sighed. 'I just don't want anything to happen to you. I couldn't *stand* it.' His stomach churned and a thick, hot lump caught in his throat. 'I'd cut off an arm or more if it meant everything else would go away and I could stay here with you now forever.'

Fleur scowled. 'You will need both your hands to beg me for forgiveness, monCœur.'

A chuckle slipped through Harry's lips. 'I daresay I will need to carry a lot of cake.'

'It will take more than cake.' Fleur's eyes smouldered. 'A *lot*

more.'

'Marzipan?' Harry watched the blue in her eyes lighten.

'Jurançon?'

Fleur turned her nose up. 'You'll have to find out.' Her face crumbled. 'But not for a little while. My suspension ends soon so I can take my exams. I will be busy. I *won't* fail. Fleur Delacour doesn't *fail.*'

'She's perfect.' Harry pressed his lips to Fleur's forehead. 'As always, non?'

'As. Always.' Fleur buried her smile in the crook of his neck. 'I forgive you,' she whispered. 'But I will not *keep* forgiving you.

You're *my* dream, too, monCœur, and I refuse to be a mere bystander in it.'

Harry's heart lurched and heat prickled in his eyes. 'I will try to stop doing it. I will.'

'You better.' Her fingers slid into his hair and tightened to the point of pain. 'Or I will have to think of some cruel and unusual punishment for you.'

'Cake-bearer?' Harry suggested.

'Human torch.' Fleur released his hair. 'Now, what did you do after you sent me away?'

*She'll find out as soon as she sees the paper tomorrow.* He swallowed and took a deep breath. *I have to tell her, or she'll just be more angry then.*

Harry tried to smother churning in his gut, but a tight fist of fear clamped itself about his heart. 'I promised her an Unbreakable Vow to keep her secrets if she wrote the article.' He forced the words out, staring away into the blue sky above her head. 'Rita took the deal, because I didn't ask her to publish it, then I killed her and cast the Dark Mark over her house. Everyone will see it and know Voldemort is returned, especially with the article and that filing cabinet.'

'It's a long way from arm twisting to murder, monCœur,' Fleur murmured. 'You said nothing about *killing* her.'

He stared down at his feet. 'She deserved it. You said so yourself.'

She slid a finger under his chin and tilted his face up toward hers. 'I do not care what happens to selfish little girls who poke at dragons, I care about you keeping secrets from me. Why didn't you tell me? Did you think I wouldn't like it? That I'd run away and leave?'

'I didn't have time to tell you,' he whispered. 'I only thought of it as she arrived, and then I panicked.'

Fleur's blue eyes bored into his, then a small smile crept across her lips. 'But you tried to tell me, non?'

He nodded. 'I did. I *did.*'

'Bonne.' She kissed him. 'Now then, since I must go back to Carcassonne before Beauxbatons, is there anything you want from Maman's shop?'

'I assume I still have to pay?' Harry teased.

'Maman is more fond of you than she was before Christmas,

but not *that* fond of you.'

Harry ran through a mental checklist of the potions he knew for ones that might be useful. *I can probably get most of the ones I need for patching me up post-ritual from Madam Pomfrey, though.*

'Polyjuice Potion?\' he asked.

\'What are you going to do with it?\'

Harry grinned. \'I\'m going to steal one of your sister\'s hairs

and pretend to be her evil twin for as long as I can.'

Fleur laughed. \'Gabby will be the more evil twin. Seriously?\'

\'It might be useful,\' Harry said. 'I might need to pretend to be

someone else at some point.\'

\'I\'ll send it to you,\' she said. 'Now, we have an hour or so of the evening left before I need to be back at the chateau...'

'Paris?' Harry suggested. 'Gabby seemed lonely...'

A soft, warm smile spread across Fleur's lips. 'That's a very good idea.' She brushed the crumbs of her cake off her front and picked one out of her cleavage. 'You can pay for us, cake-bearer.'

Harry feigned a groan. 'Poverty beckons.'

'What good will gold do you, monCœur?' Fleur smirked and

slipped her fingers through his. 'I am all you will *ever* need.'

Harry cast a glance through Fleur's cascade of silver hair at the setting sun. 'You're all I'll ever want, mon Rêve.'

# The Godfather

The willow tree's green leaves cascaded over sparkling waters and the summer sun's reflection. Green grass rustled from the far bank to the swaying copse of trees upon the hilltop, and the scent of soft, sweet marzipan drifted to Harry's nose.

'Fleur?' He swivelled.

Bare, pale branches clawed at the sky. Green leaves crumbled away from dead bark. The sun faded to an orb of crimson haze, the blue sky turned dark and grey as steel, and distant thunder rumbled. Shadows clustered beneath the dead roots of the willow, swirling 'round Harry's feet like a whirl of dark pitch and seeping into the blue of the river.

'Harry.' Fleur stood on the far bank, hand in hand with a tall shadow. The hot wind tossed her silver hair across her face. 'I'm leaving.'

Harry's heart shrank and seized like she'd twisted a knife in it. '*Why?*' Liquid heat prickled at his lashes and knotted in his throat. 'You *promised.*'

The grass died 'round Fleur's feet. Brown crept across the field until the distant copse of trees shed dead leaves into the searing gale. Lifeless fronds withered into the mud and the river of shadows yawned open between them into an abyss. A thousand faces flitted through the water, pale and faint as wisps of morning mist. Rita Skeeter's flickered through the centre of the current and lightning flashed, a faint flicker of bright green across the grim sky.

*I would've done anything for you. Anything.*

'Perfect wishes don't come *true*, Harry.' Fleur leant her head onto the shoulder of the shadow beside her and the thunder crashed. 'Did you forget? You *know* you shouldn't forget.'

'You just repeat your mistakes if you forget,' he whispered. 'But you *promised* you were different.'

'Nobody's ever really different, *monCœur.*'She offered her small, soft, warm smile to the shadow by her side, then the pair wavered and vanished.

The heat ebbed from his eyes and the lump melted from his throat. Cold crept in, a hollow, numb fist curling 'round his heart. All hint of feeling faded away, and the shadows of the abyss danced before Harry's feet like thick, dark smoke in the wind. He edged to the precipice and stared down. A thousand thousand faces stared back; their whispers drowned the crashing of the thunder and their wide, pale eyes shone brighter than the green flashing of the lightning.

'If there're no dreams left,' he murmured. 'Then what's the point?' He dipped a toe into the darkness. It clung to his skin like tar, cold as ice. 'I may as well just disappear after all.'

The endless faces whispered back, a thousand quiet mutters swelling over him like a great dark wave, and the tattered shadows of fingers reached for him from the swirling black.

'But then they *win.'* Harry dragged his heart back from the dark. 'I vanish. I become *nothing.*' He stepped away from the abyss and turned his back on it. 'And I *won't* go back to that. *Never*.'

Bright green seared across Harry's eyes.

He jolted upright into a lance of sunlight. 'Fuck. Right. Off.' He wrenched the gap in the hangings closed and buried the fading impressions of his dream somewhere down in the void. 'I'm going to

put a sticking charm on these tonight. I swear they come open every

night.'

\'Who were you talking to?\' Nev called. Harry sighed. \'Just myself.'

Nev yawned. 'First sign of madness, that.'

Harry pulled on his robes and batted the hangings aside.

'Seen any hairs on the palms of your hands?'

Nev snorted. 'I suppose I should get up and go for breakfast.'

Bed clothes rustled on the far side of the room and the red and gold hangings rattled open. Nev stepped off his bed, tangled one foot in the hangings, and plummeted to the floor.

\'Morning, Nev.' Harry stepped over the top of him and

continued toward the door. \'Breakfast?\'

\'Yes.\' Nev freed himself from the hangings and stumbled to his feet. \'I\'ve got *loads* of stuff to tell you. My gran found out a whole bunch of things in an emergency Wizengamot session last night.\'

Harry hid a small, thin smile. \'Oh?\'

\'Apparently Rita Skeeter was killed in her home and the Dark Mark conjured over the top.' Nev tripped on the end of Ron's trunk. \'Which is awful, of course, but they found all sorts of interesting stuff in her house.\'

\'What did they find?\' Harry asked.

\'Some article about Lucius Malfoy and Death Eaters that she was going to put in her column.\'

Harry glanced up and down the stairs, but saw nobody. \'So Malfoy was the one who did it then?\'

\'His associates, Gran reckons,\' Nev said as they headed downstairs toward the passage out. \'Malfoy's got an alibi, but he probably just asked some of his friends to cloak up and do it for him.\'

\'So he escapes justice once again,\' Harry said.

\'Yeah.\' Nev gritted his teeth and balled his fists. \'But that's not the end of it. Gran said Amelia Bones, Head of the Department for Magical Law Enforcement, has been working her office round-the- clock since the aurors got through the wards on Skeeter\'s home.

Almost a hundred Ministry officials resigned or were fired this morning. There were a *lot* of former Death Eaters among them.\'

*They found the filing cabinet. It's a shame I swore not to mess with her stuff or I would've been able to take it.*

Harry shrugged and ducked out through the Fat Lady's passageway. 'Good riddance to them, then. Best they aren't somewhere they can cause trouble.'

'Does mean they're probably all off kissing Voldemort's arse, though,' Nev said.

\'What\'s the Prophet saying?\' Harry stepped over the trick

step.

Nev stuck his foot right into it. 'Damn...'

'Every time.' Harry slipped his wand out and freed him. 'I'm

honestly not even sure why we have these trick steps. Someone

must have broken an ankle in one before.'

'Cheers.' Nev poked a toe at the next few steps before putting any weight down. \'The Prophet tried to make it look like it was Sirius Black and his band of rogue Death Eaters, but that excuse is wearing thin. Half of London saw the Dark Mark. Gran said their emergency Wizengamot session was largely an attempt by Fudge and the few people stupid enough not to jump ship to convince everyone that Voldemort hadn\'t returned. His days as Minister are numbered, apparently.\'

\'Does you Gran tell you everything that happens in these sessions?\'

\'Yes.\' Nev groaned. \'The Wizengamot seat is hereditary and she\'s just my proxy, which means that once I\'m seventeen I have to go myself. Gran wants to be sure I know what I\'m doing, so she spends an hour talking to me after every meeting.\'

Harry laughed. \'That sounds *wonderful*.'

\'I don\'t know why you\'re laughing,\' Nev said. \'I\'m fairly sure you have at least one seat yourself.\'

\'At *least* one?\' Harry raised an eyebrow. 'How is that democratic?'

Nev shrugged. 'It's not. The Ministry is meant to make the rules now we have the Statute of Secrecy. The Wizengamot are the bunch of powerful families that ran things before, and they get to veto stuff they think isn't okay.'

*And they passed Umbridge's decrees?*

'So how do I have more than one seat? Harry asked.

\'Your family absorbed a few other prominent names and accrued a lot of political weight. Gran mentioned that once you\'re of

age you\'ll be one of the most politically powerful wizards or witches

in Britain, especially with your fame. Dumbledore's the same.\'

\'That sounds fun,\' Harry muttered. \'A lifetime of exchanging barbed compliments with the likes of Lucius Malfoy.\'

\'Hopefully he\'ll be in Azkaban by then,\' Nev said. \'Or I\'ll be dead,\' Harry quipped.

Nev laughed. 'Probably preferable, that.'

Harry constructed a bacon sandwich from the nearby platters of breakfast, cramming bacon between his slices of toast.

\'I\'m not sure you\'ll be able to bite that.\' Nev measured the height of the sandwich with both hands. 'Not without unhinging your jaw and terrifying Ernie Macmillan with the idea that you're actually half magical snake creature.'

\'I can certainly try.\' Harry stretched his jaw to encompass the sandwich. 'Damn...' He picked up a knife and fork. 'Oh well. Plan B.'

\'Probably for the best,\' Nev said. \'You don\'t need to substitute for Ron\'s table manners when he\'s away.\'

\'My sincerest apologies,\' Harry said. \'So, what're you doing

today? Nobody comes back until tomorrow.\'

\'Professor Sprout offered to let me help her in the greenhouses. I brought Hannah in to show to her.\'

\'Hannah?\' Harry blinked, then grinned. \'That\'s not really how you're meant to introduce your girlfriend to people Nev, but congratulations for finally asking her out, everyone knows you like Miss Abbott.\'

Neville let out an undignified squeak and turned the colour of an overripe pomegranate. \'I named my MimbulusMimbletonia Hannah,\' he muttered.

\'Oh?\' Harry's grin widened. \'Well, if you want my advice, I\'d make sure Hannah, the girl, that is, knows how much you love your cactus, before she finds out you named a slimy, spiky, stinky sap shooting monster of a plant after her and takes it badly.\'

Nev gulped. \'You think she won\'t like it?'

\'I think she\'ll like it once she knows how much you love the plant,\' Harry said. \'If she doesn\'t know that, though, then you\'re going to be spending a whole lot more time with the less attractive, green version of Hannah than with the pretty, pig-tailed one.\'

\'And when you said *everyone* knows?'

\'I meant that literally *every* person in the school knows that you like her.' Harry bifurcated his sandwich. 'I wouldn\'t be surprised if Professor Dumbledore\'s end of year speech mentions it.

*If he\'s still here.*

\'So Hannah knows?\' Neville squeaked.

\'I think she was one of the first to notice, Nev,\' Harry teased. \'You spend a lot of time staring at her, then you start getting really dreamy-eyed and go all red. What do you start thinking about?\' He did his best to copy Gabby's suggestive, mischievous glance.

Nev crammed the last of his breakfast into his mouth and

gulped it down. \'I think I need to go see Professor Sprout.'

\'You could just ask Hannah to Hogsmeade,\' Harry suggested. \'She might say yes, you know.\'

tables.

Nev shot him a glare, then scurried away between the

Harry finished his sandwich. *I suppose I should check on*

*Dobby and then go and speak to Sirius. See if he's ready to tell me*

*things now.*

He swung himself off the bench and began to wander in the direction of the Chamber of Secrets.

\'Dobby,\' Harry called.

A loud crack echoed down the corridor and Dobby appeared, bobbing his head back and forth.

\'How have you been, Dobby?\' Harry walked up the stairs and along the corridor toward Myrtle\'s bathroom. 'Well?'

\'Dobby is good, Master Harry Potter.' The elf glanced around. \'Dobby is happy that his master has managed to strike back against *that* family. Dobby knows the nasty green lady. She's a *friend* of Dobby\'s old master.\'

\'She wasn\'t a very nice person,\' Harry said. \'But what happened was about making sure your former master\'s master doesn\'t win.\'

\'Dobby understands.\' Dobby bounced along in Harry's wake. \'Master Harry Potter is very noble, he tries to protect *everyone* however he can.\'

Harry stifled a grimace. *Because that's what heroes do, isn't*

*it?*

\'Thank you, Dobby,\' he said. \'Have you been watching

Professor Umbridge for me?\'

\'Dobby has. The nasty pink lady has tried to harm students over and over again, but Dobby has been making sure she can\'t.\' His whole body quivered. 'But she is getting suspicious of Dobby now, there is much more magic around her office than there used to be.\'

\'Can you still get in?\'

\'Dobby won\'t fail Master Harry Potter. Master Harry Potter risked his life to save *all* the students from the monster of the Chamber when Dobby only tried to save one. Dobby knows better now. He will do what Master Harry Potter would've done and save them all.\'

\'Thank you, Dobby,\' Harry knelt in front of the entrance to the bathroom to clasp the house elf\'s hand between his. \'Your assistance is invaluable in keeping everyone safe.\'

\'Dobby will not fail Master Harry Potter.' Dobby nodded so hard his long ears slapped against his cheeks, then vanished with a loud crack.

*Poor Dobby. Heroes aren't real.* A small stab of pity lanced through his gut and he released a long sigh. *I'll make sure loyal Dobby\'s well looked-after.*

Harry stepped over the puddle on the floor of Myrtle's bathroom. \'Open.' He hurried down the steps and past the serpent effigies. \'I\'m back.'

\'Alone? Or have you brought your French muse with you?\'

\'Alone.' Harry smothered the brief recollection of her head

upon the shoulder of that tall shadow of a man.

*I won't see Fleur for a while now. She has exams and I shouldn't distract her from them with my problems.*

\'Have you come to learn something?\' Salazar asked. \'Or are you going to tell me what happened yesterday?\'

\'I came to speak to my godfather,\' Harry said. \'He's been shut up in that house he hates, watching people get sent to Azkaban or killed over whatever's down there. And now Rita Skeeter's been killed under the Dark Mark and the Ministry's in turmoil.\'

\'You killed her?' Salazar pursed his lips. 'Was it worth it? Are they starting to believe?'

\'I don\'t know,\' Harry mused. \'I *do* know that a lot of wizards and witches who might have been Voldemort supporters, or become ones, no longer work for the Ministry after aurors discovered all the material Skeeter dug up.\'

Salazar nodded. 'Then it was worth it.\'

Harry picked up the mirror from the desk and breathed his godfather\'s name onto it, pressing a finger to his lips.

\'Harry!\' Sirius cracked a broad grin. \'How are you? How was your Christmas? I have your present, but I can\'t seem to convince Dumbledore to give it to you.\'

\'It was good.\' Harry clenched his jaw. \'Except for what happened to Mr Weasley. Dumbledore sent him down there into danger.\'

\'Yes.\' Sirius's grin vanished. \'Arthur is dearly missed. Things

have been subdued here.\'

\'He shouldn\'t have had to die,\' Harry muttered.

\'He died on duty for the Order.\' Shadows crept into Sirius's

grey eyes. \'Which is better than what I\'m doing, rotting in here, not

helping anyone. It's just like *last time*, but Dumbledore won't listen to

anyone.\'

*Perfect.*

\'Nobody should be guarding things in the Department of Mysteries,\' Harry said.

Sirius grimaced. \'How do you know about the prophecy?\'

*So it's the prophecy they're all after.* Harry ground his teeth.

*They won't tell me anything, but they'll send Mr Weasley to die.*

'I assume there was a good reason for me not being told and everyone being sent down where Voldemort would obviously attack them?' Harry raised both his eyebrows. 'It seemed like Mrs Weasley felt it was somehow *my* fault, as if it wasn't *Dumbledore's* plan...'

'Molly is just very upset.' Sirius sighed. \'How much do you know about this, then?\'

\'I\'ve gathered that it\'s about me, that it\'s in the Department of Mysteries, and that Voldemort is clearly after it.\'

\'That\'s pretty much all there is to it,\' Sirius said. 'We've been guarding it.'

\'I want to know why you haven\'t just broken, moved, or stolen it?\'

\'Only the person the prophecy is about can remove it,\' Sirius

said. \'There're some very old and nasty protections on them.

Prophecies cause a lot of trouble, so the wards are quite strong.\'

\'So only Voldemort or I can take it?\' Harry glanced at

Salazar.

Salazar wound his serpent 'round his arm and peered down with a deep frown. 'Keep going,' he whispered.

'Sirius?'

\'Yes.'

'So either I take it or people keep dying,\' Harry said. 'Surely

the smart thing to do would be to just sneak in and grab it.'

Sirius grimaced. \'This is why Dumbledore insisted we not tell you, he was afraid you\'d insist on coming to get it.\'

\'Because that makes *perfect* sense,' Harry jibed. 'It\'s fine for you all to *repeatedly* risk sneaking in and possibly *dying* to guard it, but way too risky for me to sneak in *once* and just sort it for good.'

\'Well---'

'If you can secretly guard it, then I can secretly sneak in and

destroy it.\'

*After I've listened to it, of course.*

Sirius twisted his lips about, then sighed. 'I\'ll talk to the

Order.'

\'No.\' Harry shook his head. \'Dumbledore will never agree. If

he hasn't changed his mind after Mr Weasley *died,* he's *never* going to listen to us. We can sneak in together under the invisibility cloak and tell him afterward. It'll be fine.'

A weak grin spread over Sirius's lips. \'You make it sound like I'm back sneaking out after curfew at Hogwarts.'

\'I don\'t know how to get in,\' Harry said.

\'Oh, that's easy,\' Sirius said. \'We\'ll go when Mundungus is on watch. He's had his eye on all sorts of bits and pieces from this house. I'll give him a bunch of stuff and that'll be that. I'm sure nobody else will be about in that part of the Ministry after hours.\'

\'How do I get to the Ministry?\' Harry asked.

\'Once you\'re here, I can apparate you. Everyone else already knows the secret, the Weasley\'s and Hermione were here over Christmas and in the summer to help clear the place up.' He looked down and rustled through his pockets. 'I kept this when Dumbledore gave it to me.\'

Harry studied the tattered piece of parchment and the smudged, elegant, slanted script upon it. *The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London.*

\'You *kept* the note he gave you?\' he asked.

\'I haven't left the house, so if someone finds the note, then they\'re already inside and it doesn\'t matter. When are we going to go?\'

*I need to oust Dumbledore, then get rid of Umbridge.*

\'I don\'t know for sure.' Harry said. \'I need to find a way to

sneak out without Umbridge or Dumbledore realising.\'

\'I\'ll be waiting.' Sirius grinned. The corners of his eyes crinkled and the shadows lifted from his face. \'I feel younger just thinking about doing this. It'll be good to have some excitement again.\'

\'And to destroy that prophecy,\' Harry said.

\'That too,\' Sirius said. \'Have you heard about what\'s happening at the Ministry today?\'

\'Not really.\' Harry shook his head. 'Nev said the Wizengamot's not happy with Fudge.'

'Yeah, old Augusta's just a proxy, so she'd've had to tell him.' Sirius rubbed his eyes. 'Guess I'd better explain some boring stuff to you about wizarding politics. The Wizengamot's just the collection of noble families that ran this country's magical side for nearly a millennium. The Ministry got set up to uphold the Statute of Secrecy and has kind of turned into government on the back of it. A lot of the old families didn't like that, but it's done and probably for the better.'

'So *that's* why purebloods hate muggles?'

'Part of it.' Sirius shrugged. 'Muggles and wizards have been killing each other for a lot of different reasons for a long time.

Anyway, the Ministry makes and upholds all the laws these days, but they can't just toss the Wizengamot out, because the families are still influential and powerful, and they have a right of veto over anything that's passed. That right of veto is very important for stopping anything stupid being made into law.'

Dots began to connect in Harry's head. 'So the Ministry tries

to push its agenda through the Wizengamot all the time.'

'Right, but most often the Wizengamot's too split to ever pass anything major. Just how the balance of votes works.' Sirius squinted through the mirror. 'I can't remember the exact details. Regulus loved this stuff, but I'd rather chew my own leg off than listen to it. Right now, it boils down to the fact that Fudge just about had the Wizengamot on side, but all this recent stuff is losing him that. My cousin, Tonks, said Amelia Bones has turfed out a whole

load of Ministry people on the back of the Rita Skeeter murder. A

good swathe of them were key people for Fudge.' 'So he's screwed.'

'Won't last more than a month if he doesn't get some kind of miracle.'

*He'll be looking for one, then.* Harry hid a smile and swallowed down a heady rush of triumph. *He'll leap at the chance to catch Dumbledore up to no good. This is perfect.*'

# A Black Mark

A little vial of glowing blue liquid sat on the antique dark wooden side-table beside the silk-sheeted bed, casting faint light over the room and throwing thin shadows upon the pale walls.

Bella poked the vial to the far side of the table. 'Urgh. Yucky

potions.'

*But they help us get better after Azkaban.* She picked it up

and cupped it in her hands, then closed her fingers 'round the vial and shook it until it was full of bright, swirling bubbles. *And we need to drink them to go find Andi.*

She tugged the cork out with a soft pop, then pinched her nose and gulped it down. A thick taste of seaweed swamped her mouth. 'Blurgh.'

Bella clawed back through the fog of her mind. The thick wall of grey faded to a thin, tattered veil. Countless faces swirled in it and bright, beautiful colours flashed back and forth between dancing shadows. *Don't go too far, Bella.* Cards slid back and forth across a table and pieces clicked across a board. Cissy and Andi's smiling faces flitted through her thoughts. *So many games, Bell. Just us having fun forever.*

The mark on her arm erupted and searing heat writhed

beneath her skin. 'He's *angry*, Bell.'

*Something must've happened, Bella.* She let the fire wash through her, enjoying the soft burn beneath her skin and the prickle sliding down her spine. *We'd better go see what it was, Bell.*

Bella shoved the cork back in the vial and tossed it onto the bed. She touched a finger to the Dark Mark, the oculus and marble floor of the main hall flashing through her mind, then disapparated with a loud crack.

The Dark Lord paced a small circle beneath the oculus. Faint starlight shone in the night sky above the gleam of his crimson eyes and the soft whisper of his silk robe's hem. A dry, oppressive heat flooded off him like searing storm winds.

*He's very angry.*

A volley of snaps rang through the hall. A circle of cloaks and white masks shrunk back to the walls. Silver masks cowered among them.

The Dark Lord fell still. 'Did I not say we were to remain hidden,' he hissed. 'Did I not *command* discretion.'

A shiver rippled round the room.

*Someone messed up.* Bella stifled a giggle. *That's game*

*over.*

'Whoever was *foolish* enough to disobey me. Whoever cast

the Dark Mark above Rita Skeeter's house. I will discover you.' The Dark Lord's red eyes swept round the room, pausing on each of the silver masks. 'You will *beg* me to end the punishment you deserve. And I *willnot end it*.'

A silver-masked, dark-robed figure edged forward, then prostrated itself upon the cold marble floor. 'I can assure you it was not me, my lord.' Lucius' voice echoed from beneath the mask. 'You have my word.'

The Dark Lord stared down at Lucius's grovelling and his lip

curled. 'Lucius. Severus. Augustus. Bella. Stay. The rest of you.

*Begone.*'

A loud crack echoed off the walls and down the dark corridors. Two others shuffled closer to the light of the oculus.

'My lord,' Lucius whispered.

'Get up.' The Dark Lord's tone dropped as low and soft as the rustle of his robes. 'I haven't ordered you to remain because I wished to listen to you beg, Lucius. You are either blameless or *damned.*'

Lucius scrambled to his feet. 'Yes, my lord.'

*Pathetic, Bell.* She felt a little heat bubble through her blood. *He's completely pathetic, Bella. Cissy deserved better. He's so disgustingly weak.*

'I have inspected the door to the Department of Mysteries myself and removed one of Dumbledore's pawns in the process,' the Dark Lord said. 'There is one ward that will need circumventing before you will be able to enter. A strong, simple one. Augustus, you will do this.'

Rookwood trembled and wiped his palms on his robes. 'My

lord?'

'It's an obscure sealing ward.' The Dark Lord slid his wand

from his sleeve and drew a circle of red flame in the air. It twisted into countless, flowing shapes. 'It requires an interlocking pattern of magic such as this to be drawn by the right person, else it will not allow anything to pass through it without forcing a direct confrontation of power.'

'What must I do, my lord?' Rookwood asked.

'The wizard or witch who casts it is the weakness of this ward.' The Dark Lord spun his wand upon his palm, then vanished the shimmering red flames with a wave. 'It is powerful magic and will require frequent reinforcement. You will observe the department.

Discover whoever is meant to be doing it and prevent them every time they try. Use the mind arts to make them believe they have reinforced it each time. Once the ward has degraded, Bella and Lucius may proceed.'

Rookwood bowed. 'Yes, my lord.'

'Go, Augustus.' The Dark Lord turned to Snape. 'You have done well, Severus. I am pleased to learn that Dumbledore's pawns are stretched thin.' He crooked a long, pale finger at Bella. 'Your potions haven't undone fifteen years of Azkaban, but they have restored my followers to lucidity and fighting shape. I am pleased.'

Snape bowed. 'Thank you, my lord.'

'Return to Dumbledore. Tell him nothing of my plans for the Department of Mysteries. Or, if you must give him something, tell him only the date.'

'Yes, my lord.' Snape vanished with a quiet snap. Lucius edged forward. 'My lord? I---'

The Dark Lord raised his hand. 'Are you ready, Lucius? I will not accept failure from you in this. You have gorged yourself in my absence and betrayed the promise you made to me over and over for your own gain. Another offence, another *failure,* and there will be no mercy. You and yours will pay *dearly*.'

Lucius quivered. 'I am ready, my lord.'

'Then go.'

'Bella.' The Dark Lord put his wand away. 'There are many new faces among us. Weed out those not true to the cause and dispose of them. If they are not followers of mine, then you may play with them as you please.'

Bella beamed. 'Yes!'

'And Bella...' Dark, slitted pupils and crimson irises bored into her. 'Only my inner circle can cast the Dark Mark. Only the ones who promised they would be different. The ones who swore they would do more than chase my wake in the hope of realising their own fleeting dreams of power. One of them has *betrayed* me. One of them has sided with the *muggles*.'

*The muggles.* Flames boiled through Bella's blood and a faint ripple of magic shivered across the floor, stirring the Dark Lord's robes. *Useless, boring sheep. They force us to hide and drag us down! A handicap! Deadweight!*

The Dark Lord's lips curved. 'We will purge them, Bella.

First, we must unite the magical, the *powerful*, then we will cleanse the weak from our world. They are useless to me and repulsive to endure.'

# Cactus if You Can

Gaggles of students chattered between the chairs and sofas of the Gryffindor common room. Flames crackled in the grate and a slow draft of smoke swirled up the chimney. The scent of burning pine hovered across the room.

*Almost there.* Harry cast a glance 'round the room and caught Colin Creevey's eye. He let a faint touch of magic connect their thoughts. *Let's see...*

Flashes of a tinsel-decked tree, neatly wrapped presents and a small mountain of sprouts passed through Harry's mind. Soft, comfortable ease and cheer suffused them like the heat of a long, warm bath. A snatch of the train journey back to the castle flashed through his thoughts, a rattle of rails and the highland heath through cold glass. Excitement churned in his stomach, tinged with faint dread. Pink furnishings surrounded a bubbling envelope of thick, yellow pus. Fear lanced through him, then he found himself back in his bed in a deafening crack.

Harry broke the connection. *Dobby saved him...* He grimaced at the memory of the dangerous pus. *And Umbridge needs to go. She's already trying to harm students and Dumbledore's still here. She's unhinged.*

A huge book thumped down beside him. Nev slumped into the chair beside Harry.

\'Magical cacti... Looking for something interesting?\' Harry

asked.

\'Assyrian magical plants.\' Nev flicked through the pages. \'There\'s supposed to be very special types of soil that Hannah needs to survive.\'

\'Still calling it Hannah, then.\' Harry laughed. \'Has she found

out yet?\'

her?\'

\'She\'s only been back for a few days. Who would've told

\'Professor Sprout.\' Harry grinned. \'She\'s bound to mention

the prized possession of her favourite pupil to the best Herbology student in her house.\'

Nev's face turned red. \'Please stop.'

\'That bad?\' Harry smirked. \'Look on the bright side, at least now you know she'll be flattered you\'ve named it after her. Professor Sprout will say nothing but nice things about Hannah, your Hannah, the cactus Hannah, that is.\'

'What will it take for you to stop?'

'I\'ll stop, but only when you\'ve asked her to Hogsmeade, otherwise I\'ll just get worse and worse.\'

\'That\'s the most horrible way of making sure I ask her out,\' Nev muttered. \'You couldn\'t have just tried to convince me she would say yes, could you?\'

\'I didn\'t think it would be as fun,\' Harry quipped. \'Do you know anything about runes, Nev?\'

\'Nothing that you don\'t know.\' He shrugged. \'I don\'t even take the subject.\'

\'So I\'ll have to wait for Hermione to come down and start enthusing about her essay to figure out what I might've missed and can use to fill in the last inch or so.' He sighed. 'I don't miss her lecturing, or her constant condescension, but she *was* good at essays.'

\'I\'m not sure she\'s done it yet.' Nev lowered his voice. \'I heard Lavender tell Ron Hermione was up all night. Apparently, she'd some kind of nightmare. She definitely wasn\'t taking anywhere near as many notes as normal today, so she must've been tired. Ron\'s been pretty withdrawn, too, I\'ve only seen him voluntarily speaking to the guys in our dorm, Hermione, and Lavender.\'

\'Ron\'s father died just before Christmas.\'

\'I didn\'t know.\' Nev grimaced. 'Bloody hell. I didn't even tell him I was sorry.'

\'It\'s not exactly something to shout about.' Harry frowned. 'And telling him you're sorry wouldn't help him feel better anyway.'

\'No. It doesn't.' Nev closed his book. 'It explains what he

said to Romilda Vane, though.\' Harry raised an eyebrow.

\'She was asking about your earlier adventures. Romilda\'s well-known for having a bit of a crush on you. Ron told her that they\'re only adventures for the people who don\'t get hurt and walked off.\'

\'They\'re not adventures at all. Too many people nearly died.

Me, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, me again. Several times. Calling them adventures is naïve and thoughtless.\'

*But I was playing hero. Saving all the people who'd never*

*risk themselves for me.*

Nev returned to flicking through his giant Herbology tome.

His frown grew deeper and deeper with each turned page. \'Something wrong?\' Harry enquired.

\'I\'m going to have trouble re-potting Hannah.\' Harry stifled a laugh.

'Shut up.' Nev breezed through a few more pages. \'The silica content of the soil has to be just right or it becomes too alkaline and she\'ll die.\'

\'Can\'t you just order some special soil from wherever it\'s native to?\'

\'Hannah comes from Assyria. That\'s cheating, really, though. You\'re supposed to make your own blend of soil types, but I guess it *would* be better than letting her die.\'

\'What would Hannah think if you let her namesake wilt from neglect?\' Harry pulled a three centimetre roll of parchment from his pocket and unshrunk it. \'I\'m going to go and give this Arithmancy essay to Professor Vector and hope she doesn't read any of it. It\'s not due until tomorrow, but I don\'t want to see it anymore.\'

\'Fair enough.\' Nev chuckled. \'I\'ve got lots of things to research for taking care of Hannah, so I\'ll still be here for a while.\'

*I'll go down and see Salazar, then.*

\'I might go for a walk down near the lake instead of bothering with Binns,\' Harry said. \'Don\'t wait for me or anything after.\'

Nev shrugged, \'I wasn\'t going to. I\'ve got to run a DA

meeting. It's the first one since everyone\'s come back.\'

\'Enjoy.\'

*And he will.* The corner of his lips crooked. *It's good to see*

*him doing better.*

He passed Ron and Lavender on his way to Professor Vector's submissions shelf, catching Ron's gaze. A soft, constant ache, clouded flashes of sombre Weasley family moments and the glimpse of a slim, silver chain dropping from his fingers into Hermione's cleavage.

*Can't unsee that.* Harry broke the connection and slid his essay onto the shelf. *Lavender's going to be pissed if she finds out, though. That looked like an expensive present.*

He threw a glance up and down the corridor, then disillusioned himself and strode up the staircase and along the second floor corridor.

\'Hello, Myrtle.\' Harry glimpsed a flash of pearl-white

through the door of her cubicle. \'How've you been?\'

\'Harry.\' She floated over, blushing a deep silver. \'I\'ve been alright, just drifting around. I keep feeling like I've forgotten something important, though.\'

'If it's anything you saw in the Prefect\'s Bathroom, then I don't want to know,\' Harry quipped.

Myrtle giggled. \'Are you sure?\'

Harry laughed. \'If you must...'

\'Cedric Diggory was there yesterday for the first time since he came back after Christmas. He had a *really* long bath.\' Myrtle sighed. \'All the bubbles ran out.\'

\'You\'re incorrigible.\' Harry grinned. \'Didn\'t he see you?\' \'No. I can be sneaky if I want to.\'

\'Well, no peeking on me if I get made prefect next year.' He opened the chamber. 'I want to be able to bathe in peace.'

Myrtle watched the entrance to the chamber appear with a

strange gleam in her eye. \'No promises, Harry,' she murmured.

Cold, dense air closed over him as he descended the steps. Goosebumps prickled along his arms and he shivered as he stepped into the study

\'Cold?\' Salazar asked.

Harry cast a couple of warming charms on himself. \'It\'s not warm down here. Why couldn\'t you have included a fireplace or something?\'

\'Where would I put a chimney for the smoke?\' \'You\'re *Salazar Slytherin*.'

Salazar chortled. \'Nobody\'s turned that line around on me since Godric got himself killed chasing myths.\' He stroked the head of his snake. \'Why have you come?\'

\'To learn, of course,\' Harry said. \'And maybe discuss a few ideas with you.\'

'If you want to learn something, it would be best for it to be blood magic,\' Salazar said. \'That or you can try and improve your duelling skills.\'

\'Why not both?\' Harry gestured at the time-turner.

\'As long as you don\'t overuse it. You were using it *far* too much last year, but we didn\'t have much choice to make sure you were skilled enough to survive. Overuse causes severe mental strain.'

\'We wouldn\'t want that,\' Harry said. \'Then there\'d be two senile people in here.\'

\'That\'s why you should only use it sparingly,\' Salazar sniped. \'Best to only have one of you at any given time.\'

Harry chuckled. \'Blood magic first. I can learn here for a bit, while future me practises wand motions outside.\'

Salazar ran his fingers through his goatee. \'Before we start on blood magic, have you got anywhere with the mind arts?\'

\'I\'m capable of utilising passive legilimency now,\' Harry said. \'I haven\'t tried it on more than a handful of unprotected minds to avoid the risk of detection, but I *can* do it.\'

\'It shouldn\'t make too much difference,\' Salazar said. \'The connection is so faint and slight it takes a competent practitioner to detect or prevent it.\'

\'I noticed Dumbledore\'s.'

\'You\'re naturally gifted at this branch of magic, all our family is, you\'re more than just *competent.*\'

'Modest as ever.'

\'The truth is the truth,\' Salazar said. \'Now, blood magic. Do you remember what I taught you before?\'

\'You pretty much told me that it used blood as a medium and was often sacrificial,\' Harry said.

Salazar folded his arms and sniffed. \'I doubt I said it so inelegantly, but that is a very basic paraphrasing of a rudimentary understanding.\'

\'I\'m happy to listen to a more elegant definition.\'

'Blood magic is any magic that uses blood as a medium or tether, which's what I told you.\' Salazar drummed his fingers on the top of his serpent's head. 'Because of its power, it's usually used in ritualistic, sacrificial magic. However, it can be used for just about anything that magic can be used to do: rituals like you've done, warding, enchanting, if you've the imagination, you can do it.'

*Fleur might find this interesting.* A small smile slipped onto his lips. *I could do the blood bit and she could make so many clever things.*

retorted.

\'You\'re not listening,\' Salazar snapped.

\'I was considering the applications to enchanting,\' Harry

\'You were thinking about Fleur Delacour again.' A soft

gleam appeared in Salazar's eyes. 'You had that silly smile on your

face.\'

Harry fought down a flush. \'I\'m listening.'

\'Good.' Salazar's eyes darkened. 'We'll start with wards.

You may need to know about those soon.'

'Voldemort?'

'Tom shares our family enthusiasm for such magic. I can't speak for Voldemort, but I doubt he would abandon the use of powerful magic.'

'I can't imagine he would, either.'

'Obviously, you can use blood magic as a medium in sacrificial magic to create very powerful wards like those on this chamber. Other times, you might not need power so much as specificity. A sacrifice of blood can grant you access to wards, like a key for a lock. You can either choose the ward to only allow through those who sacrificed blood in the ward's creation, or you can allow anyone to sacrifice some of their blood to gain entry. The latter can be *very* useful in creating traps. If your enemy thinks that spattering a bit of blood will grant him entry, he might be tempted to risk it.

There're all *sorts* of nasty surprises in which you can catch an

overconfident wizard who's willingly given blood to you.'

\'Can they be broken?\'

'All wards can be broken if you've sufficient power.' He uncoiled his snake from his arm and wound it back 'round his forearm in a slow, thoughtful manner. 'However, it's often the worst way to break a ward, because it forces you into a direct conflict of power.

You have to expend at least as much magic as was put into the ward

to overcome it. There's almost always a better way.\'

\'What about the wards tied to this chamber?\' Harry enquired. \'How do they work?\'

\'More complex. I did both.' Pride coloured Salazar's tone. 'The wards of this chamber are bound to my blood. Only a parselmouth can speak the words to open the entrance and only

someone of my bloodline can pass through the other wards. It\'s why you can apparate in and out of here, but nobody else can.\'

\'Except Voldemort,\' Harry said.

\'Except Voldemort.' Salazar's gaze turned distant. 'But I knew Tom well and despite twisting himself into Voldemort, he likely retains much of the same character. He would not come here until it\'s worth the risk. He never came back after leaving the school, not once.\'

\'What about portkeys?\'

\'Only someone of my blood can portkey here through the wards, though anyone who has seen the inside can create a portkey here.\'

\'What would happen if *they* tried?\' Harry asked.

\'I don\'t know,\' Salazar mused. \'Maybe you should get someone to try, just to find out. I suppose the portkey would just fail, or they might bounce off and arrive nearby. They might even vanish completely!'

'Perhaps another time,\' Harry said. 'I'd like to save playing with experimental magic until I no longer want to live a long and fulfilling life. How did you make the wards?\'

'Sacrifice,' Salazar whispered. 'Magic like that requires will and intent that can't be measured with words, blood, runes, or anything so simple. It takes feeling. It takes pain. It takes *determination*. You have to know how much it will hurt to accomplish and you have to want it enough to do it anyway.'

'I don\'t understand how you bind the magic to your bloodline,' Harry said. 'It makes sense that the stronger the magic,

the further you must go, but I don't get how to actually attach the magic to a bloodline.'

\'It\'s abstract magic,\' Salazar murmured. 'I drew a runic description of my intent within the confines of the chamber using my blood as ink just as if it were a simple ritual. That sacrifice of blood allowed me to make my blood both the medium and the key to the piece of magic. You have to put it in the runes and hold it in your mind as you create it.\'

Harry turned that over in his head. \'I think I understand. I could probably draw the runes. In fact, I guess I could draw them all wrong as long as I didn't realise.\'

'Very true,' Salazar said. 'But it's best not to try that, something weird might happen if you noticed halfway through you'd done it wrong.'

'I'd just need something to sacrifice.\'

'You've sacrificed much already,' Salazar murmured. 'Everything you've given up to survive, all those things you've left behind to reach that lovely French sunset, they'll be with you in every piece of magic you cast.'

'Is *that* why Voldemort's so powerful?' Harry wondered. 'Has he sacrificed so much his intent is just that strong?'

A small smile curved Salazar's lips. 'I fear so. And, in a way, I'm still a little proud of the magic Tom has managed, but there are some things you shouldn't sacrifice, Harry. There comes a point when you've cut away so much of yourself that there's very little left.'

*There's only power.* The chalk-white face and red eyes protruding from the back of Quirrell's skull floated through Harry's mind. *Did Tom sacrifice everything else? Bloody hell.*

\'I see.' He buried thoughts of Tom and all the little, dear things that must've been left in the wake of his path to becoming Voldemort. \'So if I wanted to create blood wards around a house to protect someone important to me, I'd have to sacrifice something of approximately equal value.\'

\'Yes,\' Salazar said. \'Though it would be strengthened by everything you've already sacrificed and you can only make wards *so* strong before sacrificing more makes no difference.\'

Harry nodded. \'Makes sense. How would I enchant something using blood magic?\'

\'That\'s the simplest use.\' Salazar flapped a hand at him. \'Lots of wizards and witches did this to ensure only their bloodline could use their creations and, of course, blood's a powerful medium to use for the creation of the object itself.' Deep creases wrinkled Salazar's brow. 'Beyond that, I would wager a great deal that most of the legendary, magical artefacts were made using sacrificial magic of the greatest sort and blood as a medium.\'

\'A powerful sacrifice and a powerful medium to create the strongest possible enchantment,\' Harry said.

'More than that.\' Salazar released a long sigh. 'I never got my hands on one, despite searching for a very long time. They're few and far between, jealously guarded, too. Imagine, though, Harry, the sort of artefact you could create from the shared sacrifice and intent of a hundred wizards.'

*If a single wizard can create something like this chamber, then something created by a hundred would be unbelievably powerful.* A small shiver rippled down Harry's spine. *No wonder they're few and far between.*

'I don't know of any, really,' he said.

\'The Caduceus was one,\' Salazar said. \'I searched for it as my wife's health failed. It was created back before even the Classical Era, but was lost during the fall of Rome. It was reputed to be a staff of healing without comparison. An item so powerful that any magic cast through it with the intention to heal was almost always successful. Rumours were that it could even prevent death. It was so famous it remains well known even amongst muggles.\'

\'Any others?\' Harry asked.

\'A few.\' Salazar cracked a grin. \'I\'ll tell you about some of them in the future, but you have more important things to worry about now.\'

\'That\'s true.\' Harry nodded. 'Fudge, the current Minister, will jump at any chance to get rid of Dumbledore and earn some credibility back. His days are numbered, so Dumbledore will likely be back by next year, if he wants to be.\'

\'If his martyr is here, he will want to be,\' Salazar muttered. Harry scowled and swallowed a shard of cold rage. \'No

doubt.'

'Do you have a plan?'

\'Dumbledore gets ousted. Umbridge gets dealt with. Sirius

gets me into the Ministry. I get the prophecy, hear it, then destroy it.' Harry bounced his fingertips together. 'My cloak ought to get me through any wards at the Ministry.'

\'Yes.\' Salazar's gaze sharpened. \'Don\'t lose that cloak, Harry. If it truly makes your magic completely undetectable, then you have something on par with the Caduceus in your possession.\'

Harry's eyes snapped to the pool of silken material upon Salazar's desk. \'Really?\'

\'Oh yes. It\'s not a story for now, you have enough on your mind for the moment, but in the near future it might be prudent for you to learn a little more about that cloak.' A small, rueful smile curved his lips. \'You should always know exactly how much something means to you.\'

\'It\'s the only thing I have from my father,\' Harry said. \'But I'm less attached to it than I used to be. I've grown used to not having much family.\'

\'Well, I\'m not advocating sacrificing it for any reason. In fact, I advise against it other than to save your own life. It\'s likely very valuable.\'

\'How valuable?\'

\'Priceless,\' Salazar whispered. \'It\'s the sort of thing wizards spend lifetimes looking for.\'

\'How intriguing,\' Harry murmured.

\'Just don\'t lose it,\' Salazar snapped. 'If you do, I will find a way to claw myself free of this canvas and beat you to death with the pieces of my former frame.'

Harry snorted. 'I did wonder how good it was. Dumbledore did find me under it once, but I'm not sure if he could actually detect me, or if he just deduced it indirectly.'

'Indirectly, I suspect,' Salazar said. 'Death is not so easily

outdone.'

'What?\'

'Something for another time. You have enough to do without getting obsessed with old myths like Godric and I.'

*That's true enough.*

Harry reached for the time-turner, ducking his head through the thin gold chain. \'Any suggestions for what I should practice for my duelling?\'

\'Try casting your shield charm and your silly butterflies simultaneously. If you can manage that then you\'ll have a very powerful defence to fall back upon should you need to weather the storm for a bit.\'

\'How can I cast two pieces of magic at the same time without weakening one or both?\' Harry demanded. 'They have different intentions.'

'Not different intentions, different *mechanics*,' Salazar said. 'You're looking too closely at how the spells work*.* Forget that one is conjuring butterflies and another a shield. The broad intent behind them is the same, so once you're able to cast without incantation or wand motion, you can produce them simultaneously.'

\'How is it any better than deflecting hexes from within the butterflies?\'

\'It\'s safer,\' Salazar said. \'You won\'t be able to attack and it\'s less flexible than duelling while your animated defence protects you, but defensively it's stronger.\'

\'I\'ll practise it.\' Harry flipped the time-turner several times and strode out over the bridge. 'I'm getting the hang of bringing it all together.'

\'Practise chaining your wand motions too,\' Salazar called.

Harry shot him a thumbs up over his shoulder as the room blurred and time flowed backward around him.

# Point of Contract

The turrets, towers, galleries and stained glass windows of Beauxbatons clung to the mountains, poised across the summit of a small peak and framed between the pine-covered sides of its larger neighbours. A crisp, blue sky spread over the heavens.

*I am done with this place.* Fleur pulled her wand from her waist. She transfigured her uniform into a midnight-blue dress, her hat into a soft, white wool jumper, and her slim, half-smart shoes into something a little more chic. *Poor Gabby must endure it for a few more years.*

'Au revoir.' Fleur wrinkled her nose. 'Non. *Goodbye.*'

She pictured the home entrance hall and appeared amongst

Gabby's shoes, kicking her own into a spare space near the door.

\'Your final exam was this morning.\' Maman drifted in from the kitchen. \'Did it go well?\'

\'It went as well as I needed.\' Fleur shrugged. \'If not quite as well as I wanted.\'

\'Which one was it? Advanced Transfiguration and Conjuration?\'

\'Yes.\'

\'It was never your strongest subject.' Maman smiled. Little lines crinkled at the corners of her eyes and mouth. \'But you are still good at it. You got all the best bits of your Papa and I. We're so very proud of you.\'

\'Transfiguration is more Harry\'s gift than mine,\' Fleur said. 'I conjured a goose and turned it into a rather nice vase, which got me good marks, but not all of them.'

\'He can't be better than *you.*' Maman pursed her lips. 'Not when he's so much *younger*.'

Fleur narrowed her eyes.

Maman winced. 'Sorry, Fleur. I didn't mean that how it sounded.' She studied her thumbnail and turned a little pink. 'Although, I do hope you and he aren't *doing* anything.'

Fleur shot Maman an innocent smile. 'Not *yet...*' Maman twitched. 'Fleur. He's---'

'How old were you when you got pregnant with me again, Maman?' Fleur asked.

'Eighteen.' She pressed her lips together into a thin line. 'But just because I'm telling you to do something I couldn't manage to do, doesn't mean it's not a good idea. I was lucky with your Papa. He loved me very much and we just started that part of our life a little earlier than we'd planned.'

Fleur tucked her wand away. 'Well, Maman, I don't intend to get myself pregnant just yet, so don't panic.'

'It doesn't always happen when you *intend.*' Maman's face turned a little darker pink. 'I had every intention of applying certain spells the night you were conceived, but, as I'm beginning to suspect you already know, things like that can get forgotten in the heat of the moment.'

Fleur turned her nose up. 'I know what I'm doing.'

Maman grimaced. 'Yes, I'm sure you do. You've been

bookmarking certain *pages* in my books since you were fourteen.'

Heat crept on Fleur's cheeks. 'Can we not have this conversation?'

'I just want you to be safe,' Maman whispered. 'You're my little girl. Even though you're already better than me at nearly everything, I remember holding you when you first came into the world. You had this little tuft of blonde hair and big, bright, blue eyes. I'd never been so happy.'

'Was that before or after you set fire to Papa?' Fleur asked. 'After.' Maman scowled. 'He made a joke at a very foolish

moment.'

Fleur sighed. 'I will be careful, Maman. We've not gone that far anyway.'

Maman crooked her finger and drifted back toward the kitchen. 'Good. Not that you should be doing anything more than kissing him at his age.' She threw a sharp look back over her shoulder. 'I do not want your Papa to have to explain to the papers why his eldest daughter is in bed with someone who's legally a *child*.'

Fleur huffed. 'We're not talking about this anymore. If you want to worry about one of us, worry about Gabby*.* She's bookmarked all the same pages,and she probably reads them thinking about the same person as I would if I didn't already have him.'

'Gabby doesn't actually *have* a boyfriend.' Maman grimaced and waved her wand around the kitchen. Various cupboards fluttered and a steaming, white mug of coffee drew together in front of her. \'Have you thought about what you will do now?\'

\'I have.' Fleur pulled a letter from under her jumper. \'I applied to join the Bureau des Énigmes and Gringotts offered me a job checking and selling enchanted trinkets. I think some of their clients don't trust goblins.\'

\'Gringotts?\' Papa appeared at the kitchen door. \'That\'s an interesting coincidence.\'

*A good thing he didn't appear a few minutes earlier.* Fleur smothered her flush. *Maman's one thing. Papa's another altogether.*

\'You\'re home early, monChéri,\' Maman said. \'Was it a particularly good day, or a particularly bad one?\'

\'A good day.' Papa shuffled into the kitchen and stole a sip from Maman's coffee. \'There was a miscommunication with whomever was arranging the portkeys for the other heads of departments. They all ended up somewhere in Sardinia rather than in Paris and as I was the only one in the right place, they had it without me in Sardinia.'

Maman plucked her coffee out of his hands. \'Didn\'t you need

to be present?'

\'Oh not even slightly. I\'m only the vice-président for the Bureau des Affaires Internationales, it was Henri who had to go and sort things out. I'm glad that I'm not the président. He had to cancel his entire afternoon in the vineyards and hurry off to somewhere in Sardinia while I did some interesting research on English magical nobility.'

*\'Papa*.\' Fleur whirled on him. \'What *sort* of research?\'

Papa raised his hands. \'Harry clearly has little knowledge of his family and its history, he needs to know about things like this, especially as he's English. I did a little bit of investigating through the

outpost of Gringotts in Paris. The only wizarding bank in England is Gringotts, so they would have the most accurate records I could easily see.\'

\'The goblins do not share information on their clients for no

reason,' Maman said.

\'No...\' Papa edged away from Fleur. \'I may have had to follow through the first steps of legal action against him to find out what I wanted.\'

\'You *what?!*\' Feathers exploded out from under her skin and heat boiled in her bones; liquid flame shifted her chin and upper jaw forward into a sharp beak.

Papa flinched. 'I didn\'t take any action and the goblins will be discreet. They simply wanted me to pay them for the information by way of acting as legal advisors for a case that will never exist. I was rather hoping that you would invite Harry here to join us. I expect he would like to learn this and he should really be the first person I tell.\'

Fleur let the heat fade and the feathers slip back beneath her skin. \'He is in school, Papa.\'

Papa snorted. \'He\'s been visiting you at all hours of the day throughout your suspension and if even the merest fraction of what we've read is true, then I don't think breaking school rules will upset him.'

*It will be nice to see Harry again.*

\'I will ask.'

Fleur wandered out of the kitchen, drifted down the hall,

and pulled the acorn out of her cleavage. 'Azure.'

It sprouted into a mirror.

Harry's face appeared in it. \'Fleur? I was about to go to one

of my classes.\'

\'Can you come here instead? It\'s probably more important than some class you're already well ahead of.\' She let a small pout creep onto her lips. 'And you owe me a visit.'

His eyes turned soft and a small smile crept onto his lips. 'Our history teacher is a ghost and his lessons are always impossibly dull.\'

\'You will likely learn more important history by coming here.

Papa took it upon himself to investigate your family.\'

\'Oh?\' Harry quirked an eyebrow. \'I will see you in a few

moments.' He vanished.

Fleur poked her head back into the kitchen. \'He is coming.' She heard a soft snap echo from the hall. \'He is here.'

Harry appeared, adjusting his robes with one hand. His magic saturated the silk like water through a sponge.

\'Nice try, Harry,' Fleur teased. 'But I can sense they're transfigured.'

Harry's smile shrank a fraction. 'Mr and Mrs Delacour.' 'Harry,' Maman murmured.

Papa inclined his head.

'Fleur told me that you\'d been investigating my family?' The

slightest edge hovered in his tone.

'My interest got the best of me,' Papa confessed. 'I was surprised to learn that you knew so little of your family and I took it upon myself to determine whether or not we might discover some unpleasant surprises when you turn seventeen.'

Harry's eyebrows rose. 'Will we?'

'I made some inquiries through the Parisian branch of Gringotts,' Papa said. 'They were helpful in some regards, but without your presence I couldn't discover everything I wanted to.'

\'What did you want to learn?\' Harry asked.

*You and your secrets, monCœur.* Fleur slipped to his side and took his hand. *At least you trust me.*

\'I\'m going to have to explain a few things.' Papa gestured into the hall. \'It might be easier to sit.'

Harry followed him through and took a seat on the chocolate-stained sofa in the corner.

*Gabby's sofa.* Fleur squeezed in next to him and threw her legs over his.

\'Here in Europe things are done a bit differently than in Britain,\' Papa said. \'The German States, Spain, Italy, and most countries have lost the majority of the noble families that ruled in the last two centuries. Traditions and practices have moved on and been modernised. France is split, but every year a few more old laws are overturned by the growing pro-modern majority.\'

\'I take it this is not the case in Britain,\' Harry said.

\'No.' Maman smiled. \'As my husband is far too fond of mentioning, Britain has been the pre-eminent magical community for

three centuries, only growing relatively stronger since Grindelwald massacred his way across the mainland.\'

\'You're concerned about the pure-blooded mantra of some noble houses?\' Harry raised an eyebrow.

\'I am concerned about Britain\'s Dark Lord, but should he fall, then the pure-bloods will fall with him. Britain\'s revolution has finally come, two centuries after France\'s, and the effects are still felt in this country.\'

\'My family is one of the old pure-blood houses,\' Harry said. \'But we're not in any way associated with the bigoted nonsense Voldemort uses to lure in followers.\'

\'As a noble family in a traditionalist society, I was worried about the existence of any agreements your family might have that you were unaware of,\' Papa said. \'In France, these practices have mostly died out and those that do occur between the few surviving old pure-blood families are frowned upon. Those families are the ones that fled the disastrous attempts of Robespierre to unite magical and muggle societies under his control and survived the war that followed. They are unpopular for abandoning their country to shelter in Britain, as most of France\'s magical families, including mine, were created during or after that chaos and looked down on those that had not suffered as we did.\'

\'I take it these agreements still exist in Britain,\' Harry muttered. \'What *kind* of agreements?\'

*You're not going to like this.* Fleur wriggled her fingers through Harry's and gave a gentle squeeze. *Someone suddenly appearing on a piece of paper to snatch your sunset away.*

Papa rubbed his chin. \'They do. They can often be very specific and still binding even generations after they are created.\'

\'It was once normal practice in Britain and not *unlikely* that such agreements exist,\' Maman said. \'Since you are with Fleur and my daughter seems quite determined that you are who she wants, we wanted to make sure she wasn\'t going to suddenly be disappointed.\'

Harry's brow creased. 'I don\'t understand.'

'I went looking for several types of agreements,' Papa said. 'First and foremost on my list was any outstanding, accepted offers of marriage between your family and any others. Such an agreement would prevent you from having any future with Fleur should it be valid.'

Harry's face tightened. Every muscle in his body tensed

beneath Fleur.

He took a long, quiet, deep breath. \'Were there any?\'

Papa grimaced. \'I still do not know. The goblins would not help me without personally giving proof you were involved with a member of my family.\'

Harry's eyes hardened. \'How likely are these agreements?

What makes them valid?\'

\'Increasingly less. The old families are too closely intermarried in most cases.\' Papa massaged his fingertips into his chin. 'They're validated in certain circumstances, usually specific to each contract. Old families often have a couple of unusual ones knocking around. The best way to check is simply to ask. The goblins have mediated such disputes for millennia for one reason or another. They will know.

'Then I will ask.' Ice crept into Harry's eyes. A strange, desperate gleam lurked beneath. 'And if there is one, I will stop it however necessary.'

*However necessary...* The burnt corpse of Peter Pettigrew reared up among her thoughts and the Dark Mark swirled in the sky above Rita Skeeter's ruined house. *I hope there isn't one. Taking the one perfect thing away from someone who's never had anything like it is a dangerous thing to do.*

'If I return with your company, the goblins will be willing to answer,\' Papa said. 'You might also take the chance to learn about the state of your family's finances. It's best to keep on top of these things.'

'I have absolutely no idea about any of that.' Harry shrugged. 'I just assumed there wouldn't be anything.'

Fleur'sheartsank. *Mon Cœur.*

Papa exchanged a glance with Maman. \'The Potters are an old family, though never particularly prestigious until the fourteenth century, when the last member of a very old and famous family married into their family and suddenly elevated their status. They were originally from France, but were forced to choose a new name to escape the associations the other branch of their family made in Aguilar with the Cathar movement. It was a good thing they did---\'

\'The Cathars were rather prejudicially crusaded against in France and Italy over a century or so,\' Fleur said. \'They were a point where muggle religion met the magical world, and drew the ire of the muggle Papacy for it. It's not really *relevant,* Papa.\'

Papa twitched. \'Your family moved away and was forgotten long before the crusades of De Montfort, but they were renowned for being a neutral, conflict-wary family for many years and

consequently outlived and absorbed a lot of other magical families, some of which were quite prestigious. Eventually all the links with greater families made the Potters great too.\'

\'You were serious about inquiring about my family,\' Harry murmured.

\'I actually already knew all of that.'

Maman laughed. 'And finally, after all these years, it's

useful.'

Papa chuckled. 'I have a long list of names that might yield

something if the goblins are asked about their vaults, but they'll only do it if you're present and won\'t actually do anything but register a request has been made until you\'re seventeen or they get something out of it. The goblins aren't popular. They survive only by keeping a stranglehold on the wizarding economy.\'

\'I see...\' Harry's eyes turned distant. \'So you'd like me to

accompany you to Gringotts?\' \'I would---'

A silver eagle the height of a man burst into the room, flaring its wings to stop in front of Harry. Silver vapour trailed from the tips of its feathers.

Maman sat bolt upright. '*Anzu*...'

\'There\'s likely nothing left.\' Harry\'s voice emanated from the bird, echoing like he stood at the end of a long tunnel.

Maman gasped. 'That's your *patronus?*'

\'He suggests making a request just in case, but insisting it

remain a secret,\' the eagle said in Harry's voice.

Harry's face turned scarlet. \'Yes, it's my patronus.'

Maman's eyes went wide as coins, then she pressed her

hand to her mouth and covered a smile.

*She knows something.* Fleur narrowed her eyes, but

Maman's smile only widened.

\'I didn\'t know you could send messages using your patronus,\' Papa said. \'How do you do it?\'

\'I don\'t know.\' Harry banished his patronus without sparing it a glance. \'I suspect I\'ll find out sometime in the next six hours. Let's go. I need to know if anything's there.\'

*The time-turner.* Fleur grimaced. *I hope you're not overusing*

*it.*

She caught her mother's eye and motioned toward the

kitchen, then swung herself off the sofa. Harry's fingers flinched after

her.

\'We\'ll leave you two to talk about history,\' Maman said. \'Try not to be too enthusiastic about it, Laurent. These are the only conversations that explain how my youngest daughter ended up like she did.'

Harry glanced at Fleur.

'Beauxbatons,\' Fleur said. 'She's doing ok.'

Maman drifted into the kitchen.

Fleur strode after her. \'What was wrong with his patronus?\' she hissed.

\'Wrong?\' Maman shifted her weight from one foot to the other. \'There\'s nothing *wrong* with it at all. Far from it.'

'So you reacted like that for no reason...' Fleur wrinkled her nose. 'Try again, Maman.'

'Veela's origin myth is that they are the descendants of beautiful witches who were raised by Anzu, long extinct, magical birds.\' Maman shot Fleur a pointed look. 'We then migrated through Mesopotamia into eastern Europe and spread.'

*And the corporeal patronus is a manifestation of someone's*

*most positive emotions.* Fleur's heart squirmed. *How sweet of him.*

\'We\'re going to Gringotts,\' Papa called. \'Do you wish to come, Fleur, Apolline?\'

\'Go,\' Maman said.

\'Maman doesn\'t wish to come.' Fleur shot Harry a smirk. 'I can apparate with Harry.'

Harry raised his hands. \'It\'s fine.'

\'I insist.\' Fleur laughed, stepped close to him and wrapped her arms around his chest, then pictured the streets of Paris.

A soft snap echoed across the cobbles. Elegant, pale stone facades flanked them.

Harry sighed. \'Did you have to do that?\'

Fleur huffed. \'Yes. It was funny. I wanted to ask you a question, anyway.\'

\'Ask away. I\'m sure we have a moment while your father recovers from watching you throw yourself at me.\'

\'I did not throw myself at you.\' Fleur turned her nose up at him, then reached out and cupped his chin. \'What do we do if we find out there's some contract in there?\'

Harry's green eyes frosted over and his face hardened. 'I will avoid setting it off.'

'And if it's too late for that?' Fleur whispered. 'You would be legally bound, maybe even magically bound.'

That small, bright, desperate gleam welled back up in Harry's eyes. 'I'll find a way.' He took a deep breath. 'I'll kill them if I have to. I *can't* lose you. I *won't.*'

*Of course you would.* Warmth rushed through Fleur. The heat pooled in her eyes and glimmered on her lashes. *Your one perfect wish.*

She tugged him close and kissed him. '*We'll* find a way. No more of this I will, I can't, I won't, mon Rêve. You made me a promise. Don't break your promise.'

Something dark rose in Harry's eyes, a dazed, dire, hollow glint. 'You made me a promise, too,' he whispered. 'You promised you were *different.*'

Fleur cradled his head to her breast. 'I promise,' she breathed into his ear. 'I am not like the shallow little girls. You're not my hero. I don't want you to save me and I don't want you to vanish when I don't need saving. I. Just. Want. *You*.'

Papa appeared beside them with a loud crack. \'Am I interrupting?\'

\'I think she was about to let go of me,\' Harry said.

\'I was not.\' Fleur pressed her lips to his and leant to his ear.

'I will not. Not ever. You're *mine.*'

\'Shall we go?\' Papa suggested.

They strolled across the street and into the marble-floored, slim-pillared colonnade of the Parisian branch of Gringotts.

\'Mr Delacour.\' An old gnarled goblin stepped out from behind his desk to greet her father.

\'I\'ve returned with the aforementioned third party,\' Papa

said.

\'Ah...\' The goblin smiled, displaying a sharp set of teeth,

then plucked a thin, black briefcase from under its desk and ushered them toward a private meeting room. \'Step this way, please.\'

'Be polite, but firm,' Papa murmured.

\'I am Nagnok, Mr Potter.' The goblin set the case on the table and snapped it open. 'I assume that you're here to verify Mr Delacour\'s questions are legitimate inquiries.'

Harry studied the goblin. \'I am.\'

\'I take it this is the daughter with whom you're involved.' The goblin spared Fleur half a glance, then reached into the case and pulled out a sheet of paper. 'Here's a list of the current contracts a member of the Potter family might be able to fulfil.\'

Harry plucked it from the creature's grasp.

Fleur's stomach knotted and churned. *I will kill whoever\'s on it myself if I have to.*

\'What does it say?\' she asked.

Harry crumpled it up into a ball. 'Gabrielle Delacour. It

seems like Gabby will get her forbidden romance after all.'

Fleur's heart seized. She blinked, then caught the small curve at the corner of Harry's mouth. '*Idiot.* I should burn you to ashes for that joke.'

\'You can set fire to him later,\' Papa said.

\'Can I enquire about the status of my family\'s assets?\' Harry asked Nagnok.

\'You may.'

Harry rolled his eyes. \'Will you tell me when I do?\'

\'I will.'

\'Then consider that my inquiry,\' Harry said.

Nagnok turned back to his case and flicked through a stack of paperwork. \'As I am not the account manager for your family and not authorised to share the explicit details without their express permission, I can only tell you that the majority of the assets your family held were liquidated by Charlus Potter to try and limit losses in the escalating wizarding war, but after his death James Potter spent all but a small fraction of it. Since then there have been a multitude of wills bequeathing small amounts to you and no further action required other than maintaining your trust fund.\'

\'Are there any further details you could share?\' Harry asked.

Nagnok closed his case and snapped the catches. \'I can tell you that your trust fund cannot possibly be exhausted under any circumstances, but if you truly tried, you'd come close to wiping out half your family\'s remaining fortune.\'

\'Thank you,\' Harry said. \'I would ask that you investigate any claim I might have to these vaults.\'

Papa passed him a paper list. Harry glanced at it, then added a single name, using his wand as a quill.

*Charming writing onto a page.* Fleur pursed her lips.

*Impressive.*

Nagnok scanned the list. 'There's almost no assets attached

to these names, little more than an unpaid dowry and its interest.\'

Harry reached out and touched his wand tip to the list; it crumbled to dust. \'Make sure that inquiry remains discreet. I'd prefer that nobody learns of it.\'

\'I understand, Mr Potter.\' Nagnok's smile showed all his

sharp teeth. \'It might cause a bit of a stir.\'

Papa's frown deepened as they left the bank. \'Which family

did you add? I'm sure I didn't miss any.\'

Harry glanced around them. 'Slytherin.\'

Papa stopped dead in the street. \'That\'s not mentioned in

*any* of the books.\'

\'I have good reason to believe it,\' Harry murmured. \'Very good reason.\'

\'Parselmouth,\' Papa muttered. \'The Daily Prophet mentioned it, but I assumed it was simply more rumour-mongering.'

Fleur huffed. \'It was one of the few things that they got right. Shall we go back before Harry is recognised?\' She jumped at Harry and wrapped her legs 'round his waist.

He caught her 'round the small of her back, then slipped his

hands down to her thighs.

'That's me throwing myself at you,' Fleur whispered,

apparating them back.

They collapsed in the entrance hall, Fleur still wrapped around him.

\'How do I always end up on the bottom?\' Harry's muffled

voice drifted up from beneath her cleavage.

'I'm sure you didn't mind *that* much.' Fleur leant back, then

hopped to her feet.

*Maman won't like seeing me straddle him after our talk this morning.* She fought a pout. *Who cares how old he is? He's mine and that's all that matters.*

'I couldn't breathe,' Harry said. 'But there are definitely worse ways to die than that.' He stood up and dusted himself off. \'I should return to school, curfew starts soon.'

Maman edged out of the kitchen. 'It was lovely to see you,

Harry.'

\'You could stay until the morning.' Fleur shot Maman a

broad smirk. 'Nobody would ever know where you were and *what*

you were doing.'

Harry turned red. Fleur caught his eye and gave him a little pout. He quirked an eyebrow. She bit her lip, gave him a little wiggle, and watched Maman's lips flatten into a thin, white line.

He turned to Maman, scarlet-cheeked. 'If everyone's ok with it, then yes. I'll still have to apparate back briefly, just to make sure I

can send the patronus.\' He glanced up and down the hall and fixed a

bright smile on his face. 'Let me do that now.'

Harry vanished with a soft snap. Papa appeared with a loud crack, his nose in a battered, brown-covered book.

Maman glanced past Fleur's shoulder at him and folded her arms. 'Laurent?'

Papa glanced up. 'Yes?'

*Try it, Maman.* Fleur pushed a little heat into her bones until her face started to shift and her eyes turned dark. *See where putting yourself in between us gets you.*

'Fleur would like Harry to stay the night,' Maman said. 'Seems fine.' Papa kicked his shoes off and stumbled toward

the hall. 'We have space.'

'*Laurent!*'

Papa stuck his head back through the door. 'Yes, ma chérie?' 'I don't think Fleur's planning on Harry using a spare room.'

Maman's arms tightened a notch. 'Don't you have anything you'd like

to say?'

Papa shot a look at Fleur out of the corner of his eye and wrinkled his nose. 'He is a *bit* young, Fleur. Although, I must admit I find it hard to remember he's fifteen half the time---'

'Laurent,' Maman hissed.

'I have plenty of space for him right next to me.' Fleur folded her arms. 'And if *I* don't have space for *him* there, then I'm sure Harrywill find some space for me.'

'Right...' Papa sighed and drew himself up. 'We had this talk when you were a lot younger, because pretty girls attract a lot of attention in a certain sort of way and we wanted you to be safe. I *really* didn't want to have it again.'

Fleur turned her nose up. 'I haven't forgotten it and I

*definitely* haven't forgotten what age you two got started at.'

Papa grimaced. 'Yes. Right. Well, I mean, I think it's alright if you want to share a bed, but I don't want to hear about the two of you doing anything like *that* until he's older.'

'Fine.' Fleur shrugged. 'You won't.'

*I can ward my room more than well enough to keep any noise from getting in or out.*

Harry reappeared by the shoes. 'Was it ok?'

Maman dropped her arms. 'It's fine, Harry. You are family.'

Fleur whisked Harry up the stairs. 'Come on, before Maman changes her mind.'

\'Do you have a spare room I can stay in?\' Harry laughed. \'Of course you do, you live in a chateau.\'

Fleur plastered her most innocent expression across her

face. 'Non.'

\'You don\'t? Really?' Harry paused and studied her door. 'Isn't this one yours? It looks familiar...'

Fleur smirked and pushed her door open. 'No *spare* rooms,

monCœur.'

you?'

Harry froze, then managed half a grin. 'You don't snore, do

*Nervous?*

Fleur hid her smile and led him into her room, tugging the

door shut behind them. She tapped her wand on the lock, leaving a soft glow. 'My parents probably won't come in, but Gabby might forget to knock.'

Harry glanced at the glimmering door handle and managed a faint smile. 'You've trapped me again. Is there a particular word that will let me out?'

She smirked. 'There are no words that're going to let you out of here, monCœur. You're *mine*.'

He grinned and slid his arms 'round her waist. 'Not even *I love you*?'

Fleur's heart flopped about. 'A good start.' She slipped her hands into his hair and tugged his lips to hers. 'Say it again.'

His lips curved. 'Not until you say it back.' She pouted. 'You *know* I love you.'

'I like to hear you say it,' he murmured.

Fleur kissed the side of his neck and trailed her fingertips down his chest to his stomach. 'That's not the only thing you like to hear me say.' Her hand slipped beneath his shirt and her heartbeat quickened. Heat traced through her veins and coiled in her abdomen.

Harry's lips caught hers. His tongue traced over her lower lip and his hands curled 'round her waist. The tips of his fingers crept

beneath the hem of her underwear. 'Aren't you going to ask?' he

teased.

'No.' Fleur felt his hands slide lower. Her underwear strained over his knuckles, the silk tight and hot against her as his fingers curved over her derrière. She held her breath. '*Make* me ask.'

Harry's thumbs drew gentle circles over her thighs, then slipped up the inside of them until they pressed against the heat pooling between her legs. Silk brushed past her thigh and drifted to the floor.

Harry crushed his lips into hers until she moaned. Fire

smouldered in his green eyes. 'Make you, mon Rêve?' She released a shaky breath. 'If you *can*.'

Harry's thumb brushed over the heat between her thighs and a ripple of pleasure swept through her. 'You have no *idea* how beautiful you look right now.'

Fleur pushed the fire swirling in her abdomen into her hands and scorched the clothes from him. Her own crumbled into ash and wisps of smoke. 'What about now, monCœur?'

Harry's eyes held hers for a moment, then slid down. They

were full of flames when they flicked back up.

Fleur's heart lurched and her breath caught. *I'm not waiting*

*any more.*

He pressed his lips to the curve of her throat and slipped his hand down between her thighs to draw gentle circles over her with his thumb. Heat pooled in her stomach and curled between her thighs, washing through her in soft, pleasant shudders until her legs trembled and a gentle moan slipped from her mouth.

'You look like a dream,' he whispered in her ear. His left hand traced up her side to cup her breast. His palm brushed over her stiff nipple.

'Non,' Fleur murmured. She took hold of his right hand and drew his fingers from between her legs, then pulled him down onto the bed on top of her. 'Non.'

Harry's breath tickled her cheek as he pressed her forehead against hers. He was hot as fire and hard as stone against the inside of her thigh. 'Fleur...'

'Non.' She kissed him, put her finger to his lips, and eased her hips forward until he hissed and clenched his jaw. 'No more waiting, mon Cœur*.*'

# Umbridge too Far

A long, steep hill stretched up into the sky. The sun set behind it in a wash of pink and orange light, sending dark shadows stretching from the hill's crown to Harry's feet. The light upon the horizon hung as distant as a full winter moon and a desperate yearning lanced through Harry's heart.

*Fleur.* He took a step forward over cold, pale stones. A great weight hung upon him as if his limbs were made of lead, but he forced himself on. *Just keep going. One step at a time. Whatever it takes.*

Harry clawed his way over the smooth, cold surface on his hands and knees, hauling himself toward the summit.

The shadows faded away.

Dead, dull eyes gleamed beneath his feet and matted hair clung to his hands. His palms came away hot, daubed red, and dripping. White stone shifted to pale skin, cold limbs, and stiff fingers, a mound of corpses sprawled beneath his hands and feet. Red bubbled up between the bodies, trickling down to the foot of the mountain and spreading out like spilt ink across polished wood.

He stumbled over the top into the light of the sunset. She stood there, bathing in its glow, her silver hair fluttering over her bright blue eyes and small, precious smile. The shimmering dress she'd worn to the Yule Ball sparkled like spun silver in the sun.

Warmth flooded through Harry's body and the weight faded from his limbs. 'Fleur,' he breathed.

'Come to watch the sunset with me?' She stared off into the

distance where a slim curve of gold sank into the dark.

'Of course.' Harry staggered forward and reached out with

one red-stained hand. 'We---'

A chasm loomed between them.

He stood upon stiff corpses and stared at her through his crimson fingers. She hovered beyond the mountain's edge, her feet upon the fading golden rays.

*No...* Harry's heart sank down into the pit of his stomach and

he closed his eyes. *I know this sort of dream.*

Fleur sighed. 'You're missing the sunset, monCœur.'

*But you're not gone yet.* He forced open his eyes.

The dying rays bled crimson beyond Fleur's cascade of silver hair. The sea of red spreading from beneath Harry's mountain frothed, churned, then surged upward over the corpses.

Harry forced words past the thick, hot lump in his throat and the fistful of razors twisting in his chest. 'I'm going to lose it in a moment. I always do.'

'That's the trouble with sunsets, monCœur.' Fleur watched the blood bubble up beneath Harry's toes with soft, blue eyes and the small smile faded from her lips. 'They don't last forever.'

The mountain trembled. Harry's footing twisted out from beneath him and he slipped down to his waist in the pale, cold limbs. The red lapped at the summit, its heat creeping up to his knees.

Despair smothered him, strangling his heart like the long dark weeds of the Black Lake.

'Goodbye, monCœur.' Fleur faded with the last of the light.

Harry closed his eyes and let the corpses drag him down into the hot dark with pale, stiff fingers, then awoke with a gasp into a faceful of silver hair. Fleur's head rested on his shoulder, her warm arms and legs wrapped tight 'round him beneath a tangle of covers.

Harry took a deep breath. *Just a stupid dream.*

He stretched for his wand. 'Tempus.'

*Merde.*

'Fleur,' he murmured, pressing his lips to her forehead. 'I have to go.'

Her grip tightened. 'Non.'

'Fleur...' He eased himself free. 'I'll be back soon.'

Her eyes slid open and she blew a stray lock of her hair off her face. 'I suppose I need to shower.' One of her hands slid down beneath the covers and a small smirk curved her lips. 'I *definitely* need to shower.'

Harry glanced about the room. 'I have no clothes...' Fleur laughed. 'Oops.'

He sighed. 'I'm sure I can conjure some.'

'Not in the bed you can't,' she whispered in his ear. 'So at least I get a show before my shower...'

Harry chuckled. 'Oh no you don't.' He kissed her on the cheek, then twisted the world back past him until he stepped into Salazar's study with a soft snap.

Salazar cackled. \'Where're your clothes, Harry?\'

He pulled on a fresh set from his trunk behind the desk and buried the memory of Fleur\'s hands burning through his clothes and hers. 'They had an accident.'

\'An *accident.'* Salazar sniggered. 'You might want to take a look at your neck. Had a close run in with a toothless vampire, did you?\'

Harry flushed and glanced in Sirius\'s mirror. A vivid crimson mark sat under his jaw line and a scatter of similar, smaller ones trailed along his collarbone. A strange sense of pride welled up as he stared at them.

*She did that deliberately.* The glimmer of mischief in her eyes as her lips drifted to his neck flashed through his mind. *I guess she didn't like that marriage contract stuff.*

Harry raised his wand to his neck, the incantation of the healing spell on his lips, then pursed his lips and conjured himself a scarf instead.

Salazar cackled again. 'Fond of them, are you?' 'Shut up, you poorly-drawn desk-graffiti.'

'What did you learn at Gringotts?\' Salazar's broad grin didn't relent in the slightest. 'I'm assuming there weren't any nasty surprises, going by those marks and your lack of clothes.'

\'The fortune of my family was mostly spent by my father in the war with Voldemort,\' Harry said. \'The vaults I might've been able to claim from connected families don't exist, save for one under your name, but I received the impression it's a meagre amount.\'

\'Were there any alliances, agreements or such?\' Salazar asked. \'Gold can be earnt, stolen, or won. Your word is more important. When given, it must be kept.\'

Harry nodded. \'None.'

Salazar patted the head of his serpent. 'That's good. You're free to carve out your own path.'

\'Once Voldemort is dead,\' Harry muttered.

\'Well, yes. There\'s no avoiding that, but you've come so far from the weak, skinny child who first came into my study and couldn\'t even recognise his most famous ancestor.\'

\'I\'m still not strong enough.' The fading sunset and the mountain of corpses flickered through his thoughts. In his mind's eye, Fleur turned her back on him as the crimson light died. 'I need *more*.'

A faint smile graced Salazar's lips. \'You will get stronger, Harry. In two years you've transitioned from a child to a wizard that almost any opponent would have to take seriously to survive. More will come if you need it.\'

'I *will* need it.' Harry stared into the painting's eyes. 'Voldemort will not stop.'

'No.' Salazar bowed his head. 'Voldemort will not stop. Tom did not stop. I could not stop.' Shadows clustered in his eyes when he raised his gaze. 'Now it's your turn.'

Harry glanced toward the book on rituals, the time-turner and the stack of notes on horcruxes in Tom's handwriting. 'I can't stop. I can't lose.'

'Fleur,' Salazar murmured. 'Of course.'

Harry turned away. 'I *can't* lose.'

'I won't tell you to lose, Harry. Just be careful what you sacrifice to win.'

'I'll sacrifice whatever it takes.' Harry snatched the Marauder's Map up from the desk. 'Fudge is desperate. If I throw him something that looks like a lifeline, he'll hurl himself after it.'

\'Fudge?\' Salazar blinked. 'The Minister for Magic?' 'Yes.' Harry laughed. 'I had to explain to Fleur's sister,

Gabby, that the Ministry of Magic was not, in fact, run by animated

confectionery.' He snorted. 'Not that you'd notice the difference half the time.'

'And?' Salazar pressed.

'Fudge is clinging to power by a thread, but seems determined not to let go if he can avoid it.'

'And the moment this Umbridge woman gives him hope of a lifeline he will seize it with both hands.\' Salazar nodded. 'Good. Hang him with it. Hang that woman, too. In my day we would've killed her for what she's been trying to do to *children*.'

\'I don't care what happens to Fudge.\' Harry shrugged. 'But nobody will be looking very hard for an unpopular former undersecretary when Voldemort returns and war looms.\'

*And she deserves it. The moment she realises Voldemort has returned, she'll trade that pink cardigan for a Death Eater's mask. She's a spiteful bigot just like the rest of them.*

'Marietta...' He scanned the map, tracing his eyes across until he caught her name near the Owlery. 'My first breadcrumb.'

Harry stuffed the map into his pocket and sprinted for the steps. 'I'm leaving!'

'I'm a painting, not blind,\' Salazar called after him.

Harry banished the water on the floor across the bathroom with a flick of his wand and cast the disillusionment charm over himself as he hurtled into the corridor. He sprinted down the hall and slid down the rail of the stairs to avoid a pair of students, then cast a cushioning charm on the next set of steps and leapt to the ground floor. Pain lanced up his legs and Harry staggered, clenching his jaw, forcing his feet on past the classrooms until he skidded to a halt inside the entrance to the Owlery.

*Who else is about?* Harry checked the Marauder's Map, but saw only Marietta's name hovering over his. *We\'re the only two.*

He prowled up the steps to the Owlery itself. Marietta's red hair bounced along near the window as she hummed a soft, fast tune and her owl fluttered its wings, hopping along her wrist.

*Focus and intent. Like the mind arts.*

Harry slid his wand from his sleeve. 'Imperio.'

His magic connected them and Harry felt his will seep through her thoughts. His intentions swirled into hers like blood into water until everything was red and only his will remained.

Marietta released her owl, then hurried past Harry and down the steps. He watched on the Marauder's Map as she made a direct line for Umbridge's office.

*Perfect. And now to wait...*

He removed the spells concealing himself and drifted back to Gryffindor Tower, smiling at the Fat Lady as she let him in.

Neville, Ron, and Seamus laboured at one of the tables, pestering Hermione for assistance. She answered their questions with a roll of her eyes, toying with a slim, silver chain about her neck.

Harry spied Katie, Alicia, Angelina, and the twins. He walked over and squeezed into the chair beside Katie. 'Hi!' He glanced at her Transfiguration essay. 'That doesn't look very interesting.'

Katie pouted. \'It isn\'t.\' She squirmed 'round to drop her feet in Harry's lap. 'Do it for me?'

Angelina huffed under her breath and Alicia folded her arms. Fred and George gave Harry a pair of sharp nods.

\'Hush, you two,\' Katie said. \'You\'re leaving at the end of this year and Harry will be my closest friend.\'

Harry wiped away an imaginary tear. \'Am I not already your closest friend?\'

\'No.\' Katie grinned and patted him on the cheek. \'You\'re not cute or female enough.\'

\'Well that seems a bit sexist,\' Harry said. \'Do you want help with your essay?\'

Alicia smirked. \'With *NEWT level Transfiguration*? That\'s sweet of you, Harry, but Katie\'s one of the best in our year.\'

Harry rolled his eyes and conjured a single black butterfly. \'Sure?\' He directed the butterfly to land on Katie\'s face.

\'Get it off, Harry!\' She growled and swiped at it until it burst into a wisp of black smoke. \'Did you conjure that from the air?\'

\'Yes,\' Harry said. \'Figured out how last year.\'

\'I remember.\' Katie scowled. \'You showered the table in them at lunch. They couldn\'t fly properly.\'

\'That was then.\' Harry smiled and conjured another pair. \'What shall I turn them into?\'

\'Earrings,\' Angelina suggested.

\'A boyfriend for Katie,\' Alicia jibed.

Katie twitched and shot Alicia a glower. Harry caught Alicia's eye, then turned both butterflies into large spiders and dropped them into her lap. She shrieked and swatted them away onto the floor, and Ron swore from the far side of the common room.

Harry laughed, summoned the spiders, then transfigured them into a pair of glass earrings in the shape of broomsticks and deposited them in Angelina's hand. 'All yours.\'

Angelina poked them with her wand. \'Will you turn them into spiders if I put them on?

'Not if you're *nice*.'

Alicia edged back into her seat. 'Sorry,' she muttered. Katie nudged his elbow and shot him a hopeful look. *Fine.* Harry conjured another couple of pairs.

\'Now you can all have matching quidditch earrings,' he said.

Katie plucked both pairs out of his palm and tossed one set

to Alicia. 'These are really good, Harry.' 'Thanks, I made them my---\'

A distinct, irritating cough cut through the hum of the common room.

Umbridge waved the DA list in one pale, stubby-fingered hand, flanked by a pair of aurors. \'Mr Potter, Mr Longbottom, Miss Granger, and Mr Weasley.' She simpered. 'You will all be accompanying me to the Headmaster\'s Office.'

'What for?' Ron shouted.

A broad, gleeful smile spread across her face. 'We will be discussing your expulsion, Mr Weasley.'

Katie grabbed his arm. 'Harry,' she whispered.

Harry patted her on the cheek. 'I suppose we\'d better go and find out what this is actually about.' He cast a long look at Hermione, who chewed her lip, then nodded.

They followed the clicking of Umbridge's pink heels and the ringing of the aurors' boots to Dumbledore's office.

Harry's stomach knotted and swirled, his heart pounded,

and a cold thrill trickled through his veins. *Nearly there...*

'Wait here.' Umbridge disappeared upstairs with her escort. 'Don\'t say anything,' Harry hissed. 'Not a word.'

'She has the list,' Nev squeaked.

'Someone must've betrayed us,' Ron muttered. 'We\'ll soon see who it was, Hermione\'s jinx will make it pretty clear.'

Hermione gnawed her lower lip and rubbed at the dark rings beneath her eyes with the back of her hand. 'We're in *so* much trouble.'

'The list is dated,' Harry said. 'At the moment there\'s no proof we\'ve done anything but sign up the day *before* joining became illegal.'

Ron gaped. 'Clever.'

'It might not be enough,' Nev said. 'There are *aurors* here, it must be more serious than just an illegal club.'

*Much more serious.* Harry hid a small smile. *But hopefully*

*they're here for Dumbledore, not us.*

'Come up, children,' Umbridge snapped from the top of the

stairs.

Harry stepped into the Headmaster\'s Office and glanced

around. Silver instruments spun, twirled and swirled on the shelves, and Fawkes perched over the desk, his beady eyes on the bowl of sherbet lemons.

'The Minister will be here shortly,' Umbridge announced. 'He will pass sentence on these miscreants and expel them from this institution for good.'

'I\'m here, Dolores.' Fudge stepped from the flames. 'Dumbledore.'

'I\'m afraid that you have me at a loss, Cornelius.'

Dumbledore stood up and slid his chair back beneath the desk.

'Oh, I\'m sure I do, Dumbledore,' Fudge crowed. 'We\'ll deal with Potter and his co-conspirators after we get to the heart of the matter.'

*A good sign.* Harry smothered a small smile. *If we're not the heart of the matter, then Fudge thinks he's found his lifeline.*

'Of course, Minister.' Umbridge simpered. 'At the suggestion of one of Hogwarts\'s more conscientious students, I discovered this.' She proffered the DA list to Fudge, but clung on to it when the minister tried to take it. 'I've been aware of this group for some time, but I did not even begin to suspect what we were *truly* dealing with.'

'Dumbledore\'s Army?' Fudge gasped. '*Army?'*

Dumbledore remained unmoved.

Harry held his breath. *He won't attack Fudge and the aurors.*

*He can't, not with Voldemort lurking in the shadows.*

'Exactly, Minister.' Umbridge pulled a wide smile across her pale face. 'It\'s obvious what has been happening here. Potter and his friends have been recruiting to assist Albus Dumbledore in subverting the minds of young witches and wizards. He\'s been filling their heads with his nonsense and lies while he schemes to steal your seat.'

'Well,' Fudge breathed, spinning his hat in his hands. '*Well*.

You four will have to be expelled for your part in running a clearly

illegal organisation.'

'Illegal?' Dumbledore shot Harry a quick glance. 'This list is dated from *before* the relevant educational decree was passed; its existence is not proof of anything at all.'

'I suppose that hardly matters.' Fudge released the list. 'Your crimes are far worse, Dumbledore.'

Umbridge snatched the list and tucked it away inside her

cardigan.

*Good.* Harry smothered a flare of triumph. *Marietta*

*convinced her it was more important than just a list.*

'My crimes,' Dumbledore mused. 'My crimes, Cornelius?' 'You\'ve been plotting against me,' Fudge cried. 'Raising an

army to overthrow the Ministry by manipulating the Boy-Who-Lived

and your students.'

*Oh, now I'm a victim rather than a villain. Wonderful.*

'I have indeed been plotting against you,' Dumbledore said. 'That\'s a confession,' Fudge blustered. 'You will be taken

into custody, formally charged, and then sent to Azkaban to await a

trail.'

*Well,that\'s more than Sirius got. And it ought to keep Dumbledore away for long enough.*

'That sounds awfully tedious, Cornelius,' Dumbledore said. 'I can think of a very long list of things I would rather spend my time doing. Are you sure you want to insist on this foolishness?'

Fudge sputtered. 'Foolishness? *Foolishness?'*

'Dawlish,' Umbridge snapped, a mottled, crimson flush

rising up her neck.

One of the aurors, an average-looking man in a grey coat, shifted his footing and his hand drifted toward his chest.

'Don\'t be silly, Dawlish.' Dumbledore smiled at the man as though he were an errant first year. 'I remember you being an excellent student and I\'m sure you are a fabulous auror, but raising your wand against me would not be wise.'

'Do you intend to duel the Minister, myself, and two aurors?'

Umbridge demanded.

Dumbledore's eyes hardened. 'Only if you are insistent upon continuing with this madness.'

\'We\'re not intimidated,\' Umbridge spluttered.

Fudge's knuckles whitened around the brim of his hat. 'Now,

see here---'

Dawlish's hand shifted another inch and Dumbledore\'s wand appeared, releasing a series of blinding white flashes. Harry slipped his wand into his hand as Dawlish went flying, then tucked it away and held his breath, blinking away the bright, green spots swirling in his vision. Glass shattered and pieces of silver instruments clattered to the ground. Dawlish, the other auror, Umbridge, and Fudge sprawled across the wooden floor. Fawkes trilled and poked his head over the edge of the desk to peer down at them.

Dumbledore tucked away his pale wand. \'They will wake

soon.'

\'Will you go back to the headquarters?\' Ron blurted.

*Grimmauld Place.* Harry smothered a grimace. *He better not,*

*or I'll have to find a way around him again.*

\'No.\' Dumbledore shook his head. \'I will use this chance to take a little holiday. I might go visit the countryside or perhaps catch some sea air.\'

\'What do we do?\' Hermione asked.

\'You stay here, Miss Granger,\' Dumbledore said. \'Even if I am not headmaster, the castle\'s wards make it one of the safest places in Britain. Besides...\' He stepped over Fudge's limp form. \'I have little doubt that I will return to being headmaster soon enough.\'

\'Harry.\' Dumbledore's bright, electric-blue eyes fixed on Harry\'s own.

A faint connection formed between their thoughts. Harry batted it away.

\'You have made good progress.\' Dumbledore nodded. \'Continue practising, please, it is more important than you can imagine.\'

Fawkes trilled, leapt from his perch into the air, and clasped Dumbledore\'s left hand in his talons. Dawlish began to stir.

\'One moment, Fawkes.\' Dumbledore retrieved the bowl of sherbet lemons on his desk with a wink.

The phoenix warbled, then they both vanished in a flash of

red fire.

*And now I wait.* Harry pulled one of the chairs across next

to the wall and took a seat amongst the shattered glass and debris. A quiet, soft satisfaction coiled beneath his ribs, but he kept the smile from his face. *But not for long; trying and failing to capture Dumbledore means Fudge probably isn't going to last the week.*

\'Where is he?!\' Dawlish staggered to his feet and drew his wand. \'Proudfoot!\' He cast a gentle white spell on his partner.

Proudfoot stirred with a groan, dragging himself upright on the ruined bookshelf. \'He couldn\'t have apparated. Check the stairs.\'

Dawlish sprinted from the room, wand in hand. Proudfoot helped Fudge to his feet and retrieved his dented bowler hat.

Umbridge dusted her cardigan off, clutching at the list, then snatched her wand from the floor.

\'Return these children to their dormitories, Dolores,\' Fudge instructed. \'We will discuss the situation at length in your office when you return.\'

Umbridge tittered. \'I\'m sure they can make it back on their

own, Minister.'

\'Very well then.\' Fudge shooed them toward the door. \'Off to bed with you four. Let this be a lesson that not all figures of authority are to be blindly believed in.'

Harry uncurled from his seat and picked his way through the broken glass.

Fudge caught his arm. \'I\'m sorry about all that nonsense in the Prophet, my boy. Dolores has mentioned you haven't corroborated any of Dumbledore\'s absurd claims, but the papers tend to get carried away. Rita Skeeter made up all sorts of rubbish, it cost my friends their careers in some cases.\'

\'Thank you, Minister.\' Harry eased his arm free and paused

at the door. 'I appreciate your apology. All is forgiven.'

'Water under the bridge, my boy.' Fudge beamed. 'Hopefully, you can have a nice quiet year without any more of this nonsense.'

'Yes, Minister.' Harry hid a smile. 'Good luck with the Wizengamot.'

Fudge's face crumbled and he fiddled with the rim of his bowler hat. 'Yes. Well. I fear Dumbledore has managed to turn them against me. Still, the fight's not over yet. Dolores will do her best to discover what he's been up to here before it's too late.'

*Perfect.* A small smile spread across Harry's lips. *I'd probably be top of her hit list anyway, but let's make sure.*

'I wish Professor Umbridge luck, then.' He caught her eye and shot her his best imitation of Fleur's small smirk. 'She'll need it, knowing Dumbledore.'

# Status Quo Andi Bellum

The Dark Lord prowled the shadows beyond the ring of light spilling in through the oculus. The half-moon hovered in the sky amongst tattered wisps of cloud and veiled stars beyond the glass. A circle of silver-masked, dark-robed figures watched every step the Dark Lord took.

*One of them is playing games.* Bella glanced between the gleaming silver faces. *One of them thinks they can beat the Dark Lord, Bella.* She giggled under her breath. *One of them's going to die, Bell.*

'I am pleased.' The Dark Lord's whisper echoed beneath the pale frescoes and white marble. 'Our numbers begin to swell with those dissatisfied with European regimes. The alliances built by Grindelwald stir as we gather momentum. Our old allies, those magical creatures whose territories and lands have been stolen by swarming muggles, will flock to rejoin us. Soon, we will be ready.'

*Ready to play, Bell?* Bella ran a finger down the length of her wand. *The game never ends, Bella, not while we're alive.*

The Dark Lord's circling slowed and he paused on the balls of his feet in the moonlight. 'Once Britain is ours, we will have control over the pre-eminent magical power. We will halt its slow decline, then rebuild its strength. The rest of the magical world will follow or fall before us. And then, *finally*, we will be ready to save our world from the slow rot that's killing it. The powerful do not hide from the rabble. The superior do not let the inferior dictate their lives.'

*Muggles.* A little heat traced through Bella's veins. *Boring, useless, cattle who want to drag us all down into the mud to suffer with them.*

'Go forth, my followers. Be ready. Together we are going to accomplish something *great*.' The Dark Lord's murmur came soft as the shadows clinging to the room's corners and he crooked a finger. 'Bella.'

'Yes?' She bounced across.

An odd gleam flickered through the Dark Lord's eyes. 'Fetch Greyback for me. I promised him a boon in return for his loyalty.'

Bella cocked her head. 'A boon?'

'Something he thinks will give him the power he needs to defeat me and spread his curse across the country.' His lips curled into a cold grin. 'Greyback thinks I do not know his mind.'

'I'll fetch him.' She giggled. 'Maybe he'll try to do something he

shouldn't.'

'He is at the gates.' The Dark Lord closed his eyes for a moment. 'Nagini is keeping watch on him. Do *not* kill him, Bella. I will be *very* angry.'

Bella beamed. 'I'll only kill him if he tries to kill me.'

The Dark Lord's crimson irises and slitted pupils bored into hers. 'Not even then, Bella, but you may hurt him as much as you like *after* I'm finished with him, should he annoy you. It will make a good test of the boon I'm going to grant him.'

*Boring...* She pictured the tall wrought-iron gates, the gravel road and the harpy-topped pillars that flanked it. *All this skulking and scheming is so boring.*

Bella stepped out onto the gravel with a loud crack. 'What's the time, Mr Wolf?'

A talk, dark form loomed from the trees. Yellow eyes glinted from a face of dirt-crusted skin, tangled hair, and thick, crude features. 'Dinner time, little witch.'

She giggled. 'If you try to eat me, I'll eviscerate you and feed

you your own entrails, Mr Wolf.'

'I don't try to *eat* anything.' Greyback padded over the gravel. 'I

just bite *once*.'

Bella stuck her hand out. 'Come on, then. The Dark Lord is waiting.'

Greyback's huge hand seized hers in an iron grip. He bent and

sniffed her skin. 'No point in biting you anyway, you're too old for me.'

'Too old?' Bella huffed. Heat flashed through her veins. 'You're not supposed to talk about a lady's age, Mr Wolf!'

Greyback grunted as smoke curled from beneath his fingers

and the faint reek of burning hair and skin drifted to Bella's nose.

*But if we play with him, Bella, the Dark Lord will be cross with*

*us.*

'But I'll let you off with a scolding just this once,' she said. 'Just apparate me there, little witch.' Greyback's yellow eyes

flicked up to the moon and a broad grin of jagged, sharp teeth spread

across his face. 'I've plans for tonight.'

Bella rolled her eyes and apparated them back into the hall. 'Fetched him.' She paused and giggled. 'Really, though, he should've been the one doing the fetching. *He's* the dog.'

Greyback released a dull growl. 'I ripped the throat out of the last person who made a joke like that.'

She laughed. 'That's not how you play fetch, Mr Wolf. You're supposed to go get the stick for me.'

'Bella...' The Dark Lord's figure curled together in the centre of the room like smoke. 'Greyback will need all his strength to survive the bestowing of my gift. Go amuse yourself elsewhere.'

*Somewhere like Andi's house, Bella.*

'Ok.' She beamed and apparated away to the small, squat,

muggle dwelling.

Harsh, white, muggle light spilt through the gaps in the curtains into the street and the glass bubble at the end of the metal pole above her flickered with light, then died.

*We should knock, Bell.* She eyed the door and the neat, square garden. *But we don't want to be caught, Bella, or the Dark Lord will be cross.* Bella disillusioned herself and crept round the side of the house through a small gate.

Short grass stretched away to a thin, blue, wooden fence. A scatter of cheap, wooden chairs and a short patio overlooked a small pond before a large pair of glass doors. The mudblood she'd glimpsed with his arms 'round her sister sat in one of them, a glowing cigarette hanging from between his lips.

'What an ugly house,' she said.

'The fuck!' The mudblood leapt to his feet and tugged his

wand from his pocket.

Bella disarmed him and stuck his wand through the girdle of

her dress. 'Don't be annoying. Where's Andi?'

'Like hell I'm telling you where my wife is.'

Tonks.'

'Tell me.' Bella stamped her foot. 'I want to see my sister.' 'You Narcissa?' The mudblood eyed her. 'I'm Ted. Ted

'Don't care.' Bella peered through the windows. 'And no, I'm

not Cissy. Cissy's busy being sad and boring.'

The colour drained from the mudblood's face. '*Bellatrix*.' 'Just Bella!'

A strangled laugh escaped the mudblood's lips. 'Just Dora,' he muttered. '*Jesus*.'

'Where's Andi?' Bella demanded. 'She needs to come with me and help make Cissy fun again.'

'You're really nuts, aren't you?' The mudblood folded his arms and clenched his jaw. 'Well, I ain't telling you where Andi is. She doesn't want to see you or Narcissa. You can try whatever you want, but that's not changing.'

The glass door slid open and a familiar figure with long, dark curls and grey eyes stepped out onto the patio. The hem of her blue dress whispered around her knees. 'Teddy? Are you done smoking?'

'Andi!' Bella bounced on her feet and beamed. A flood of warmth rushed through her chest. 'I missed you, sister, but I'm back! We can play together again now!'

Andi twisted 'round and stared. A storm swirled in her grey eyes, its shadows bleeding out into the faint wrinkles of her face. 'My sister's dead. She died when she was nine. She fell four storeys and her skull shattered on the floor. I killed her. You're just a ghost.'

'I'm not a *ghost!*' Heat boiled up inside Bella.

A ripple of air burst from within her, stripping the neat grass from the dirt, shattering the cheap garden furniture and tearing through half the house. The mudblood tumbled across the ground and smacked into the wall, then crumpled to the floor like one of Cissy's dolls. Bricks and glass rained down into the mound of rubble behind Andi.

'We're sisters. Sisters forever.' Bella huffed and crossed her arms. 'The weird sisters, like the band you love.'

'You're not my sister, ghost. You've never been my sister.' Andi pulled her wand out, tears leaking down her face. 'But it's time you moved on.'

*You're not making any sense, Andi.* Bella stifled a knot of frustration and glanced down at her reflection in the pond. Her eyes glowed like violet stars. *Of course I'm your sister. We've always been sisters.*

Andi took a deep breath and raised her wand. 'I'll do it myself. It's all my fault to begin with.'

Bella tracked the tip of Andi's wand. *Maybe she's just playing, Bella.* The frustration faded. *Of course, Bell! It's another game! She's our sister, of course she wants to play with us!*

'A game!' She cocked her head and bounced on her feet, pulling her wand out of the waistband of her dress. 'I always beat you at these games, Andi!'

'It's not a game, ghost.' Red light flashed from Andi's wand

and splashed against the gatepost. 'I don't play games. Not anymore.'

*It's definitely a game.* Bella beamed. *She'd never call me 'ghost' like that for real.*

'It's all games.' She giggled. 'But okay. If you win, I'll go until you've calmed down, Andi, and we can play another time. And if I win, you have to come back to Cissy and I, and play with us again straight away.'

'Teddy.' Andi glanced over her shoulder. 'Get somewhere...'

Bella frowned at the still mudblood on the floor. Crimson seeped out from under his head. 'He's already lost, Andi. You should pay attention, you're not going to beat me if you're *distracted*.'

'Avadakedavra,' Andi hissed.

Green light flashed past Bella's shoulder. *High stakes, Bell!*

A pleasant thrill shivered through her.

'That's better!' Bella ducked another green beam and stuck

her tongue out. 'My turn.'

*Pretty purple. Bright pink. Shiny yellow.* She hurled all her colours at her sister.

Andi batted some of them away and threw up a bright shield. Flashes of colour burst against it, white sparks showering down into the wreckage, then the shield burst like a bubble. She transfigured the garden furniture into a steel mesh and hurled it forward. Bella unleashed a wave of bright pink fire, sending molten metal spattering over the dirt and across the patio.

'Avadakedavra,' Andi cried.

Green light arced past Bella's thigh.

Andi!'

Bella pouted and crossed her arms. 'That's not a nice spell,

Andi pointed her wand at Bella's chest and blinked tears

away. 'Avada kedavra.'

The green light splashed against her stomach without so much as singing the purple silk of her dress.

Bella sighed. 'You've got to *mean* it, Andi. It's not fun if you let me win.' Fire crawled through her veins. 'Don't *let* me win! It's cheating!'

A shimmer tore from her, throwing Andi back into the rubble of the house and tossing debris across the garden.

'Oops.' Bella clapped her hands to her mouth. 'Didn't mean to do that.' She skipped across the dirt and the steaming spots of cooling steel to stand over her sister.

Four iron rods stuck through Andi's chest like the pins from the butterflies in Cissy's collection. Blood trickled from the corner of her mouth and a red pool spread beneath her back. 'Guess you *won,* ghost,' she gasped. 'How does it feel?'

A horrible cold washed through Bella. 'Don't die, Andi.' Tears prickled at her eyes. 'You *can't* die. Who will play with me and Cissy?' Her magic roiled and churned beneath her skin like boiling water. 'I didn't die when *I* lost. *You* don't have to die either!'

Andi's grey eyes darkened. 'Better to be dead than to turn myself into something like you did, Bell.' She dribbled red down the front of her blue dress and brushed a hand against Bella's foot. 'But I *am* sorry, Bell. I'm so, *so* sorry I killed you. I ruined everything.'

Bella watched the light fade from Andi's eyes. 'You said we'd be sisters forever!' She poked Andi with her toe and stamped her foot. 'Don't die, little sister! You're not meant to lose yet!' Fire seared through her veins. 'Andi! *Andi!*'

A bubble of violet light crackled out from within her. Andi's body crumbled as the magic swept over her and the mudblood's corpse burst into flames. The remaining walls of the small house shivered, then crashed down into a pile of shattered brick and stone. Plaster dust hovered over it like a soft, thick veil of fog.

Bella watched it settle over her sister's ashes, wrestling with the knot of frustration and the tangle of thorns twisting up in her chest. *Who'll come play with me and Cissy now? I can't cheer Cissy up on my own!*

'I'm sorry you lost, Andi. I wanted to play with you again *so much*.' She stumbled away toward the gate and a tight, hot knot coiled in her throat and around her heart. Tears trickled down her cheeks. 'Bye bye, Andi,' she murmured. 'Bye bye.'

*Cissy's going to be even more sad now.* She paused and stared down at her reflection in the pond. White dust coloured her long curls, shining tear tracks traced her cheeks, and her violet eyes glowed bright as candle flames. *Everyone loses, Bella. Even we'll lose one day. This game's over, so we find another one. And another one. And another one. And we never get bored or sad again.*

# Umbridge's Own Diary

A calm, clear blue sky hung over the Great Hall. Umbridge presided over a subdued lunch from the headmaster's seat. A two metre gap stretched between her and the next teachers at the staff table.

Harry twirled his wand in his hand, enjoying the shivers of warmth that rushed up his arm. His picture smiled back from the front of the paper beneath a stark headline. *The Boy-Who-Was-Lied-To.*

Cedric Diggory swung in next to him and tapped the title

with a finger. 'You've been exonerated, I see.'

'For this week.' Harry shrugged. 'Hero one year, villain the next, victim the year after. I might manage a full cycle soon.'

*Stupid, shallow people. They love putting someone on a pedestal, then the moment that person acts human, they delight in tearing them down.* He swallowed a sour heat. *And then, then they remember that they needed them, and come crawling back to replace them on that pedestal all over again.*

Cedric waved Ron and Hermione a bit closer and Ron dragged his plate of food down the table, scattering carrots everywhere.

'*Ronald.'* Hermione flicked her wand at the carrots and sent

them zipping back onto his plate. 'Honestly. Don't be such a lout.'

\'I figured out who betrayed the DA,\' Cedric said. 'Wasn't even that tricky.'

*Oh?* Harry raised an eyebrow.

\'Who?' Nev clenched his fist around his fork.

\'Cho said her friend Marietta Edgecombe hasn\'t even received a rebuke from Umbridge or her squad of inquisitorial morons. Her mother works at the Ministry, too; she\'s one of the officials who helps to monitor the floo network and fireplaces at the castle.\'

\'Marietta isn\'t part of the DA,\' Hermione said. 'She couldn't have known.'

\'She was at the first meeting,\' Nev said. \'She left before signing the list. I\'d bet she told Umbridge and that\'s why she was looking for us in the first place.\'

Ron swallowed a mouthful of carrots. \'She still wouldn\'t

have known where to find the list.'

\'Where was it?\' Harry asked.

\'We hid it in the Room of Requirement,\' Hermione replied. \'I tested it. I was afraid something might go wrong. There was no way it could be found by anyone who didn\'t already know where it was.\'

\'Can you show me?\' Harry enquired. \'I\'m good at using the room, I might be able to figure out how Umbridge found it.\'

Hermione shook her head. \'We tried everything already.

Neville's an expert at using the Room of Requirement.\'

\'Let\'s go,\' Nev said. \'Harry taught me how to use the place, it\'s a good idea.\'

Hermione huffed under her breath and chewed at her lip, but trailed them out of the hall and up the stairs. 'There's a pair of inquisitors on the seventh floor all the time now.'

Harry pretended not to notice the dark glower Umbridge sent him from where she perched on the headteacher\'s chair, pink heels resting on a pink cushion half a metre above the floor.

\'Has anyone seen any hint of the jinx Hermione placed on the list?\' Cedric asked.

\'No.\' Ron shook his head. \'And we\'ve all double checked every face. None of our members have shown any sign of it, and none of them have been absent, ill, or gone home.\'

\'Could it have simply been removed?\' Harry asked.

\'No.\' Hermione smiled. \'Nobody could betray the group and avoid my jinx.\'

*Well, that\'s not quite true.You left too many loopholes in the intent of your enchantment, too focused on direct betrayal and not thinking of indirect ones.*

\'So Marietta seems likely,\' Cedric said.

\'Yeah,' Ron said. 'I\'ll set the twins on her if she did it, they\'ll

make her as miserable as everyone else is with Umbridge in charge.\'

\'I still don\'t see how Marietta could have told Umbridge about the list,\' Hermione muttered.

\'She knew it existed,\' Nev said. \'Maybe she followed us to the room.\'

They hurried up the stairs in silence, pausing on the sixth

floor.

Ron pulled out his wand. \'I\'ll distract them.\'

\'Let me change your hair first.' Hermione cast several enchantments on him. Ron\'s red hair darkened to a jet-black like Harry\'s own, his freckles faded, leaving his skin pale, and the bones of his face seemed to shift upward.

*He looks a bit like me now.*

Hermione tutted. 'I'd change your eye colour too, but I don't know enough to mess with them.'

*Me neither.* Harry grimaced. *Complicated things, eyes.*

Ron gaped at himself in the window. \'Blimey, Hermione.

How did you do this?\'

Hermione swelled up. 'I---'

'Later,' Harry said. 'There's not much left of lunch.'

Ron darted up the stairs, the echoes of his footsteps fading.

\'Stupefy,' he cried. 'Stupefy!'

They crept up after him, then out 'round the corner. Two students in green-edged robes sprawled in the corridor beneath the tap-dancing troll tapestry.

\'I thought you were going to *distract* them,\' Hermione

hissed.

Ron shrugged. \'Seemed easier to just stun them. They

weren't looking and they'll be fine.\'

Hermione cancelled her magic with a wave of her wand.

'There. Back to normal.'

Ron winced as his face rearranged itself. \'That\'s bloody

uncomfortable.'

Hermione shot him a glare. 'Don't swear, Ron.'

\'Let\'s go.' Nev strode forward and summoned the door to the Room of Hidden Things.

Mountains of discarded objects stretched off into the

distance.

\'Wow...\' Harry stared around him as if it were the first time

he'd seen it. \'You hid it here?\'

\'Yes.' Nev frowned. 'We thought she'd never find it.'

\'It seems like a lot of people have found this place,\' Cedric said, pointing at the endless stacks of stuff. \'If Marietta ever followed Cho, or any of us, she could well have stumbled across this place like everyone else must have done.\'

Nev's face darkened. 'I didn't think of that.'

Ron and Hermione led the way toward the bust of the warlock. Harry hung back staring into a pile of Grindelwald's leaflets until the others passed him by.

\'We left it here, under the bust,\' Hermione said.

Harry glanced at the ugly features of the warlock, then around at the stacks of chairs, books, magazines, and endless contraband. *Nothing's changed, really.*

\'It\'s not very far from the entrance,\' he said. \'Umbridge has had a month or so to search this place, possibly with help. She might have just come across it.'

\'You think she just got lucky?\' Ron asked.

\'What other explanation is there? Nobody on the list betrayed us, or whatever jinx Hermione used would have come into effect, and only the three of you knew where the list was in the room.\'

\'Harry has a point,\' Cedric said. \'Marietta\'s a smart girl, she could've easily followed us to the room if she wanted to. Cho says she didn't expect her to betray us back when the DA started, but she\'s not so sure now.\'

\'It hardly matters,\' Harry said. \'It was found. Dumbledore\'s gone. You heard what he said, though, Fudge isn\'t likely to be Minister for much longer and he\'ll be back.'

\'S\'pose you\'re right,\' Ron muttered. \'We\'ll just have to endure Umbridge.\'

'Dumbledore knows what he's doing,' Hermione said. 'He's

*Albus Dumbledore*.'

Harry bit back a sarcastic jibe. *He's off on holiday somewhere, probably trying to decide whether he ought to offer me up to Voldemort on a silver platter this summer or as some kind of Christmas present.*

\'Let\'s go back,\' Cedric suggested. \'Lessons start soon.\'

Hermione lingered before the bust, running her fingers over

the warlock's head with an odd expression.

\'Hermione?\' Harry caught her eye and formed a faint

connection between their minds. 'Are you ok?\'

She blinked, then turned away from the bust. 'I'm fine.'

Fear fluttered through her mind. Flashes of bad exam results, the quiet ache of loneliness and loss, and a flash of silver in her palm.

'If you say so.' He slipped out of the room, trailing the others back down the way they'd come.

One of the silver-badged Junior Inquisitors hurried across the Great Hall, his robes creased and a large purple bruise forming on the side of his face. He stopped in front of the staff table to speak to Umbridge, whose face turned a mottled red.

\'Tell me we don\'t have Defence Against the Dark Arts next,\' he muttered to Nev.

\'I could, but I\'d be lying.\'

\'Wonderful.' He tracked Umbridge's glare out of the corner of his eye. 'Be careful. Make sure nobody says anything.'

*I'm definitely going to be her first suspect.* Harry drifted toward the classroom. *Between the list, Fudge's desperation, and Dobby sticking all her furniture to the ceiling of her office, she should be reaching boiling point any day now.*

\'Ron won\'t listen,\' Nev said. \'Not if she makes him angry

enough.\'

\'He might listen to Hermione,\' Harry suggested.

\'It\'s worth a try.\' Nev hurried after the pair and pulled them

into a heated, whispered conversation as they entered the class.

\'Books out and wands away,' Umbridge snapped. 'We will be recapping the chapters on defensive theory from now until your exams. Study hard and you will succeed.\'

Harry opened his pristine copy of Wilbert Slinkhard\'s worst and only publication, pushing his hand along the spine to try and keep the book from closing itself. Hermione etched notes in the margins of her copy, crossing out parts of the text and squeezing in small paragraphs between the lines. Ron\'s eyes glazed over and Nev rested his chin on his elbow and his elbow on the desk.

*What an absolute waste of time.*

Harry caught Umbridge's malignant glare and brushed at her thoughts. The list of signatures hovered among them with a flash of silver and sapphire, a clear vial loomed beside his face and the members of the DA, the word *veritaserum*echoed from the back of her mind, and a twisted, sour heat throbbed in her heart, growing stronger the longer Harry held her gaze.

He broke the connection and glanced down at his book.

*That sort of hate can power some nasty spells. Maybe I ought to prod her into exploding at me before she tries to torture someone unable to endure.*

Nev fell off his stool with a muffled thump and a light titter ran around the room. Umbridge surveyed the room with a glower, then went back to poring over the DA list, clutching her wand in her short fingers.

\'Are you alright, Nev?\' Harry whispered.

\'Fell asleep.\' Nev rubbed his shoulder. 'Not the most exciting lesson, this.'

\'Shall I liven it up?\'

*Umbridge looks like she's only an incident or two away from snapping and trying something drastic to get the truth of the list.* He weighed up his options. *I need to make sure she goes for me.*

\'What will you do?\' Nev asked.

\'Watch.\' Harry smirked, flicked his wand into his palm under the desk, and pointed it toward Parvati\'s textbook at the far end of their row.

*An iguana, I think. Just like back in First Year.* He transfigured the book into the large reptile, chuckling under his breath at Parvati's shriek.

\'What's going on?\' Umbridge jumped to her feet and craned

her neck.

\'There\'s an iguana, professor,\' Harry announced, drawing his

wand and approaching the conjured lizard as if it were a dragon. \'I\'ll take care of it.\' He raised his wand, then paused, and placed it on the desk before retreating to the far side of the room.

\'What are you doing, Mr Potter?\' Umbridge demanded. '*Kill*

*it!'*

\'I'm avoiding conflict with a dark creature, professor.\' He

struggled to keep his face straight. \'Should I flee now?\'

Laughter burst from the class. The iguana dragged itself toward Nev, who surrendered his wand and backed away to the wall.

\'That\'s quite enough.\' Umbridge jabbed her wand at the

iguana.

A white flash burst from its tip, the iguana jerked as if on

visible strings, then exploded into chunks, spattering Parvati in blood, guts, and lumps of bone. She sat there, shaking like a leaf, her eyes squeezed shut.

'Out,' Umbridge hissed. 'Out! All of you!'

'Bloody hell,' Nev muttered. 'What the *fuck?*'

'Hold on, Nev.' Harry retrieved his wand and vanished the pieces of iguana off Parvati. 'It's gone, Parvati. Come on, we need to leave.'

Lavender shot Harry something between a glare and a thank you, then led her friend out by the hand.

\'What\'s veritaserum?\' Harry asked as they hurried down the

corridor. 'Some kind of truth potion?'

\'A very powerful truth potion,' Nev said. 'Gran told me that it couldn't be used for Death Eater trials in the Wizengamot though, because it can be resisted and the antidote's undetectable.'

\'How can you resist it?\' Harry asked.

*I'll probably have to resist it. Let's hope the Mind Arts help.*

*It seems like they should.*

\'I\'m not sure,\' Nev said. \'Gran said it produces a powerful compulsion to speak honestly, but nobody would know if you took the antidote beforehand.\'

\'Thanks,\' Harry murmured.

*If I could get my hands on the antidote, it'd be perfect.* He hid a grimace and pointed a hand toward the quidditch pitch.

*Otherwise, I'll just have to try and avoid drinking it or hope my skill at*

*the Mind Arts is strong enough to overcome the compulsion.*

'Katie?' Nev nodded and drifted off.

Harry strolled out into the stands and watched Katie flit through the hoops. Her tight, black quidditch jersey fluttered as she

corkscrewed past the goals, then she caught sight of him and arced her drive around to alight beside him.

'You did come!' She leant his firebolt against the stand and plucked the scarf off Harry's neck. 'Nice scarf. Did you conjure this?'

'I did.' He snatched it back and dropped into the seats in the

first row.

Katie's eyes flicked to the purple mark on his neck. 'What's

this, Harry? A *hickey?*'

Harry looped the scarf back 'round his neck. 'Just a bruise.' '*Sure*.' Katie laughed and clambered onto the bench beside

him. 'Frenchie give you that?'

He sighed. 'Yes. Go on, then, get it out of your system. I'm sure you've got a whole list of jokes.'

'Anyone else seen it?' Katie murmured. 'No.'

She stared down at her lap. 'Are you okay?'

'I'm fine...' Harry caught her eye and quirked an eyebrow at her. 'I was expecting more teasing, really.'

Katie shot him a weak smile. 'I mean, I would, but I was

actually a bit worried, you know.'

'Worried about what?' Harry poked the mark. 'It's not contagious. It's mostly faded now.'

'You, silly.' Katie nudged his leg with hers. 'You're a bit

young for the sort of thing that hickeys are meant to come with. Girls

grow up faster than guys and, well, I'd probably not be okay doing *that* a year ago with some older guy when my head had cooled down. If Frenchie's pressuring you to do stuff...' She squirmed. 'It's illegal for a reason, Harry. I know she's a bit older and you love her, but she should wait until you're ready.'

A little warmth soaked through Harry's chest and he gave her a small smile. 'Thanks, Katie, but it's nothing to worry about.'

'If you're sure.' Katie's face lit up. 'Want to practice to get

your revenge on her?'

Harry laughed. 'Practice *how?*'

She gave him a coy smile. 'You can always practice on me Harry, after giving me that firebolt, you can do *whatever* you want to me.'

He snorted. 'I thought I was too young...'

'Apparently not.' Katie beamed and shrugged, brushing her shoulder with his. 'How was Frenchie? She any good?'

Harry choked. 'I'm *not* telling you about that.'

Katie rolled her eyes. 'You have to talk about stuff like that

with *someone*. I'm your best friend, Harry.'

'I can talk about it with Fleur.' Harry raised a finger. 'And you said I wasn't female enough to be your best friend, you liar.'

'Someone who's *not* Frenchie,' she replied. 'Come on, spill.

It's good for you to talk about her with someone who won't say anything andI'm *really* curious to know what it's like for a guy. And she can't be perfect *all* the time, so when you need to vent about

some tiny, annoying thing, I'm here, just like I am for Alicia and Angelina.'

'Do you even know what it's like for a *girl*?' Harry asked.

Katie turned red. 'No.' She waved her hands in the air. 'I mean, I had *plans,* but they kind of fell apart a bit.' She shrugged. 'I can wait. It's worth waiting for the right person.'

'Definitely.' Harry smothered the recollection of Fleur's flushed face, her fingers digging into the skin of his back, and the feel of her against him.

'You've got a really dreamy look on your face, Harry...' He wiped the expression off. 'No I don't.'

'Too slow,' Katie sang. 'Now spill. How was it?' 'Good?' Harry grimaced. 'I mean. It was really good.' 'Better than when you're just by yourself?' Katie asked. 'Better than what?'

She made a crude gesture with her hand. 'When you're doing it yourself.'

Heat rushed to Harry's face. 'Er... yes. A lot better.'

'Huh.' A wicked glint welled up in Katie's eye. 'I've got a *very*

interesting image of you in my head right now.'

Harry felt the heat on his cheeks rise. 'Wonderful.'

'Ok, I'll play fair. Something embarrassing for something embarrassing.' Katie giggled and patted him on the thigh. '*You* were the first boy I thought about while doing that.'

Harry's image of Fleur shifted. Her silver hair and eyes turned brown and it was Katie's grin beneath him rather than Fleur's hot, hard kisses.

'Good image?' Katie teased. 'Better than me not wearing that seashell bra or anything much else?' She cast a glance down at his lap and grinned. 'Are you going to need a cushion, Harry? I can steal you one of Umbridge's nice pink ones.'

Harry smothered that image before it got going. 'I was thinking about Fleur.'

'*Suuuuuure*.' Katie pouted. 'Well, I don't blame you, Frenchie has me beat in the face, boobs, legs, *and* sexy accent department. It's not fair. The only way I'd be able to keep up would be being *really* kinky. Fulfil all those fantasies of yours.' She winked and smoothed out her tight, black jersey. 'Got any quidditch ones?'

'You only have yourself to blame,' Harry quipped. 'And Roger Davies, too.'

*And me, even if I thought I was doing the right thing stopping you from hexing Fleur.*

Katie's smile faded a fraction. 'That's true. I wonder, if you'd still been with me for the Yule Ball, would it be her sitting here while you thought about the two of us together?'

'Not a chance.' Harry laughed. 'She'd never come back to the

UK without a good reason, she hates the weather here.'

Katie's lips thinned and she reached across, tugging Harry's scarf up to his jaw. 'Of course she hates the weather. And the food. And the people. And just about everything else from what I heard.'

'Not really.' A small smile crept over Harry's lips. 'I mean, she's not fond of the food here, but she dislikes people in general, not because they're from the UK.'

Katie shrugged. 'Enough about Frenchie, have you heard about the new educational decree?'

'Another one?' Harry rolled his eyes. 'Really? Why even

bother?'

'It's not going to make it through the Wizengamot, but

Umbridge already told Filch he can use corporal punishment anyway. That vicious old bastard's probably getting his whips out as we speak.'

'I *have* always wanted to be whipped,' Harry muttered. '*Fantastic*.'

'You can whip me *whenever* you want.' Katie leant her head onto his shoulder and dropped her voice to a sultry whisper. 'If you were feeling in a certain sort of mood, and you caught me all alone on the quidditch pitch, I wouldn't object *at all*. You could tell me to do *anything* and I'd never tell *anyone* about the things you made me do. I'd just come crawling back for more.'

'Wow...' Harry laughed. 'You weren't kidding about kinky, were

you?'

Katie pulled back and laughed. 'Only way a normal girl like me

can keep up with someone like Frenchie is by being more fun than

she is.' She shrugged and the mirth drained from her face. 'If I'm not

fun, I'll never have a chance to spend time with you. You'll just vanish off to France instead.'

Guilt stabbed at his gut. *She's afraid we'll stop being friends, like Hermione was.* He smothered the niggling in his stomach and took a short breath. *But I've not forgotten, I've learnt from my mistake.*

Harry slipped an arm around Katie's shoulders. 'You're not just some *normal girl*. You are, despite you constantly teasing me about Fleur, our slightly disastrous date, and your refusal to admit I'm better than Alicia and Angelina, my best friend.'

Katie sniffed and turned away to swipe her sleeve over her eyes. 'Thanks, Harry.' She swivelled back 'round with liquid eyes and a small, quivering smile. 'I'm going to fly while it's still nice weather, *dark master*, so unless you really do want to have your way with me up here in the quidditch stands, I'll catch you later.'

Harry pulled her into a hug. 'Later, Katie. Don't break my firebolt.'

She clung to him, her fingers curling into his clothes, then jumped back and grabbed the broom. 'It's *my* firebolt now.' Katie dabbed her face on the shoulder of her quidditch jersey, then kicked off into the air.

Harry watched her soar back up into the sky and drift around above the pitch with a small smile. *I guess I'd better do some research on veritaserum.*

# True Freedom

A soft heat pulsed on his chest. Harry opened his eyes and yawned, then dragged the silver acorn out from under his shirt. 'Azure,' he muttered, sitting up and patting down his hair

The metal acorn bloomed into a tree, then shimmered into a

mirror.

Fleur's face appeared. 'Bonjour, mon Cœur.\' Her eyes swept

over him. 'You look good like that. Come see me, I have your Polyjuice and we need to talk.'

Harry's breath caught. \'That sounds ominous.' He dragged a smile onto his face; a bright, wide one. 'Have I done anything deserving of being scorched?\'

Fleur's eyes softened. 'Nothing to worry about, Harry. I meant my promise.'

Relief flooded through him. \'Coming, ma Princesse.'

'Be quick.' Fleur's face vanished and the mirror shrank back

into an acorn.

Harry dropped it onto his chest and pulled some clothes on, then disillusioned himself and slipped out of Gryffindor Tower. He bypassed Filch, who stalked the corridors with a horrid grin muttering about beatings to his vicious cat.

*You're on my to do list.* Harry paused to watch him shuffle along the corridor. *Dobby can't watch you and Umbridge at the same time.*

He hurried into the bathroom and gave Myrtle a wave. \'Hi!'

She half-raised a hand, an odd, distant look hovering in her

silver eyes. 'Have you ever been to London?'

'A few times.' Harry paused as the chamber opened. 'Why?' Myrtle shook her head. 'Was I there?'

Harry blinked. 'Er... no? I thought you couldn't leave the

castle grounds?'

'Right.' Myrtle drifted through the cubicle doors and stared down into the dark of the chamber. 'It must've been a memory from when I was alive, but I'm *sure* you were there with me.'

'I don't think so.' Harry shot her a rueful smile and stepped

into the passage. 'Sorry, Myrtle.'

A shiver rippled through her translucent, silver form. 'Don't worry about it, Tom.'

He froze on the step and a fist of ice clamped 'round his spine; its chill rushed through his blood. *Tom?!* Harry hurried down into the chamber and stared into the pool. *No.* He let the chill fade. *I must've misheard.*

Harry shot a grin at Salazar and snatched a sufficient handful of galleons from what remained of his Triwizard winnings.

'Enjoy yourself, Harry,' Salazar called.

'I will!' He spun the world back past him and stepped into

the atrium of the Delacours\' chateau.

Fleur sat on the bottom step of the stairs, her silver hair swept over one shoulder of her midnight blue dress. A single vial of Polyjuice rested on the ground between her feet.

\'I\'m here. How---\'

She surged to her feet and crushed her lips against his.

'Good. I missed you.'

Harry fought down a thick, hot lump in his throat and blinked back tears. *So that's what that's like.*

\'I have your Polyjuice.\' She scooped the vial off the floor.

Harry watched her bend over for it and felt a little heat trace through his veins.

She smirked as she stood up. 'I saw that.' 'Saw what?'

Fleur laughed and slipped her hand in his pocket, fishing out a handful of galleons. 'That'll do it.'

Harry took the vial and shook it. 'This looks an awful lot like badly cooked porridge. Why is it that potions are always so unappealing?\'

\'Not all of them are.\' Fleur tucked the galleons into her bra

with a wince. 'Why're these so cold?'

'They were in the chamber, it's chilly down here.' 'It feels like there's ice cubes on my nipples.'

Harry's gaze dipped to Fleur's cleavage. 'Why on earth do you know what that feels like?'

'I don't.' She shrugged. 'But it's supposed to be a thing...'

'Weird.' Harry tucked the vial away. 'What was so important?'

I was accepted by the Bureau des Énigmes,\' Fleur said. \'That\'s *brilliant*.\' Harry swept her into a hug and pressed her

against his chest. \'I *told you*you wouldn\'t fail.\'

Fleur rolled her eyes. 'You just hadto get your *I told you so*

in, didn't you?'

Harry chuckled. 'As if you'd've done anything different.'

A peal of laughter burst from Fleur's lips. 'I would've said it in a better French accent, monCœur.' She took a deep breath. 'I said no.'

'What?' Harry leant back and stared her in the eye. 'But that's what you've wanted for ages?!'

\'I asked to delay the beginning of my role there until I had

completed my contract at Gringotts,' she said.

'You have a contract at Gringotts?' Harry frowned. 'Why?

For what?'

\'I signed it a few days ago. I start in a few weeks as a liaison for Gringotts and the private magical artefact retrieval groups. I\'ll be based in London. This way, we won\'t have to endure another year like this one and I\'ll be there to help.\'

His heart seized. 'But it's *safer* in France.'

Fleur's eyes narrowed and darkened several hues. 'Have you forgotten your promise, monCœur?'

'No,' he whispered. 'But I still don't like it.'

'I would be upset if you did,' she murmured. 'But I will not be sitting here like some shiny, silver cup for you to win at the end of your fight.'

Harry clawed for a way around it. *Someone else might be able to persuade her to stay here.*

\'Did you speak to your parents?\' he asked.

\'I did.' Fleur's eyes shifted to midnight blue. \'They weren't ecstatic about it. They knew straight away the reason I'd taken the role, I've little interest in the enchanted trinkets they scrape out of holes in the ground and hike to fools; it\'s basically part time and not very challenging.\'

Harry's heart sank. \'What did they say?\'

'They told me to be careful in Britain. Maman suggested I

apply for a role at Hogwarts.\'

\'And your father?\'

'Papa asked what our plans were. I think he understands

anything we plan will be for the both of us now.\'

A warm glow and a tangle of fear wrestled back and forth

beneath Harry's ribs. 'So they don't mind.'

'They're not going to be able to stop me either.' Fleur's eyes flashed black. 'So stop trying to find a way to keep me here without breaking your promise!'

He sighed. 'I'm sorry, mon Rêve. I am, it's just---'

'I know.' Fleur kissed him on the cheek, then rested her forehead against his. Her eyes faded back to summer-sky-blue. 'The only perfect thing you've got. Something you can't bear to lose.'

He pulled her against him and tried to smooth out the

tangle of emotion. 'I can't lose. I *can't.*'

A small pout crept onto Fleur's lips. '*We* can't lose. I will work at Gringotts, it pays well enough to cover the cost of renting.\'

\'Have you chosen anywhere?\' Harry ran a hand through his hair. \'I could ward the place to make sure it\'s much safer.\'

\'How?\' Fleur cupped his chin and tilted his head up. \'I'm

better with wards than you are, remember?\'

\'Blood magic.\' Harry grinned. 'It's not the sort of thing I want to be caught doing, but it will keep you safe.'

\'Us,\' Fleur said. 'You're *not* living with your muggle relatives when you could be with me. You don't need them anymore, you have moi.'

\'You want us to *live* together?\'

She flinched. 'You don't want to?'

Harry shook his head and grabbed her hands. 'Nothing like that, I just didn\'t expect it. I\'ll only be sixteen in a couple of months. Although, thinking about it, the time-turner might actually mean I\'ve already made it.\'

\'We've been together for almost a year,\' Fleur murmured. 'It\'s not such a short time and, well, I *refuse* to let you go back to that place.\'

'I've never even talked about it.' Harry quirked an eyebrow. 'Why do you think it's so bad?'

Fleur's eyes flashed black as pitch. 'I know *because* you

don't speak about it. I know because you used to avoid even *touching*

me and because people don't cling to *one perfect wish* if they didn't spend all their lives wishing and never watching any of them come true.'

Harry grimaced and studied the vial of polyjuice. His heart sank down into his stomach. 'I guess I'm a bit weird, aren't I? I'm sorry.'

Fleur turned her nose up. 'Don't apologise for being yourself, monCœur.'

'I want to live with you,' he murmured. 'I do.'

\'Really?\' Her heart hovered in her blue eyes. \'I know it\'s a big step, but I - I would very much like it, monCœur. I would come home every day for the whole summer and you would just be there...\'

'I just, I don't want anyone to know about *us*.'

'Hiding me away, monCœur?' Fleur's lips curved into a smirk. 'Afraid all the girls at Hogwarts will realise you're just toying with their hearts?'

Harry snorted. 'More like I'm concerned about getting unexpected house calls from Dumbledore or Voldemort.'

\'So we do it in secret,\' Fleur said. \'You go back to your relatives, then you disappear and come live with me. We keep our distance in public, but that's fine, because we're not likely to cross paths anyway.\'

'Dumbledore will find me,\' Harry said. \'The Dursleys will tell him I left and that I\'m able to use magic outside of school. They've no reason to keep my secrets.\'

\'Memory Charm them,\' Fleur replied. \'I know most of the theory behind the Fidelius Charm, with a few months I\'m sure I can learn how to cast it, then we can\'t be found even if he knows you\'re gone.\'

'How does it work?' Harry asked. 'Because I'm fairly sure my

parents relied on that charm...'

'It can only be used to protect the permanent location of living, sentient, magical beings, and by permanent, I mean in almost constant residence. It has something to do with souls.' Fleur frowned. 'The book I read on it makes it sound as if the soul is something like an enchantment. Magic cast by subconscious intent or perception, like the belief you're alive.'

*The Killing Curse kills because it affects the soul, and dementors are meant to affect it, too. Perhaps they strip away part of that sense of self from the body, somehow. The Killing Curse does it so thoroughly a person can't endure it without an anchor elsewhere*. He turned it over in his head. *But how does the fidelius use that principle to work?*

Harry? Fleur poked him. 'You've gone very quiet.'

'Souls are tricky,' Harry murmured. 'A magic-powered sense

of self, I read.'

Fleur blinked. 'I would love to read whatever it was you read that in. It sounds very similar to what I read and the book I read wasn't intended to be read by students or teachers or anyone but the head of the school.' She wrinkled her nose. 'It was a gift from Grindelwald to the headmaster back when he was seeking support.'

'What did it say?'

'The Fidelius isn't something to be done lightly, monCœur. If we do it, we create a bubble within which our sense of self, as you called it, will be concealed beneath the secret keeper's own. While we're in the bubble, our existence, and the existence of anything within that bubble, requires the sense of self of our secret keeper to understand. Like a key, it unlocks the ability to perceive anything within the bubble. Our secret keeper can share that key with any deliberate action that confirms the existence and location of us and our bubble. The risk is that it requires a *lot* of trust. Without that trust, it simply *can\'t* be cast, because of the incompatibility of the souls.' She shook her hair out and tossed it over her shoulder. 'It also necessitates that the charm only be cast for things that take a great deal of trust to share. You can\'t just Fidelius your favourite library table, it has to be something important and secret.'

'Is it dangerous to cast?'

Fleur hummed. 'I don't think so. Just difficult. If you get it wrong, you can just cancel the bubble.'

'So we'd just need to choose a secret keeper we can trust

completely and who won't be in any danger whatsoever.'

\'I know just who to choose.\' Fleur smiled. \'Someone most don't even know exists, but who has no reason in the world to give us away. Someone who will be safely here in France.\'

*One of her parents?*

\'Who?\'

'Gabby, of course.\' Fleur laughed. \'Who knows about the two of us? And who of them knows about my baby sister? She's well protected here in France out of the eye of either Voldemort or Dumbledore.\' She pulled a face. \'Why *are* you so worried about Albus Dumbledore?\'

Harry swallowed a bitter heat. \'I am beginning to believe he

would rather make a martyr of me than anything else.'

Fleur's eyes flashed ink-black and swelled to twice their usual size. Her chin and nose thrust forward into a serrated beak and feathers sprouted through her skin everywhere Harry could see. Her magic tugged at his thoughts, pulling his gaze to the swell of her breasts and the curve of her hips. White-hot sparks danced over her hands and heat washed over Harry's face.

Harry swallowed. 'Fleur?'

She took a long deep breath and her face shifted back. 'Pardon,\' she murmured. \'I hope you don't find my other form *too* unattractive.\'

'Your magic makes that literally impossible.' He cupped her cheeks between his palms and kissed her soft, rose lips. 'And it's you. I love you, covered in feathers or not.'

Fleur's lips curved into a pout. 'But you'd probably prefer there was no beak.'

'It does look moderately terrifying.' He grinned. 'If a kiss goes wrong, you might bite off my nose and then I'd look like Voldemort.' Harry caught her eyes and tapped his temple. 'Besides, I'm more than a little weird myself.'

Fleur stared at him for a long moment, then crushed her lips against him, knocking him back against the wall. 'You are staying *mine*,\' she whispered between kisses. 'Weird or not.'

Harry smiled and pulled her tight to his chest. 'I can live with

that.'

\'You will have to. I am not letting you go.' She tucked her head into the crook of his neck. 'It's decided, then. We will find a place for ourselves, I will get Gabby to be our secret keeper, then we will ward the whole place. You will come join me as soon as the summer starts and we will go from there.'

\'I have a trust fund,\' Harry said. \'It\'s around fifty thousand galleons from memory.\'

\'That\'s *some* trust fund.\' Fleur shook her hair out of her face and swept it back over her shoulder. 'Enough for us to discreetly find a small place for ourselves if I help.\'

\'From what Nagnok said, I suspect that the Potter family fortune is around six times that.\' He grinned. \'Though I can\'t access any of it, except the trust fund, until I\'m seventeen.\'

\'Your fund tops up every year, doesn\'t it?\' \'Yes.\'

\'Good. That means we won\'t have to get a loan to buy somewhere, only combine what we have.\'

\'Have you looked at anywhere?\' Harry asked.

\'A few places that seemed like they might be affordable,\' she said. \'I saw a nice apartment I liked, but having muggle neighbours can cause a lot of problems. There was a small house in one of the magical villages in Dorset and a nice little place in Godric\'s Hollow...\'

Harry winced.

\'You don\'t like Godric\'s Hollow?\' Fleur asked.

\'I don\'t think I want to live in the village my parents were killed in,' he said. \'Every time I pop to the shops, I'd walk past the memorial to their deaths. Maybe the other small house?\'

\'It\'s in Budleigh Babberton,\' Fleur said. \'A charming place.

It\'s in the West Country. I could happily choose there.\'

\'I leave it up to you,\' Harry replied. \'Just not Godric\'s Hollow, or Ottery St Catchpole, the Weasley\'s live there and they'd alert Dumbledore.\'

\'You\'re going?\' Fleur narrowed her eyes. 'You're in that much of a hurry to get away from me, monCœur?'

'I would very much prefer to stay.\'

\'Then why do you have to go?\' Fleur moaned.

\'Now I have the Polyjuice, I can sort out a vicious old man with a broom, get rid of Umbridge before she hurts anyone else, and go prophecy hunting before Fudge gets thrown out of office and Dumbledore pops back up in the Great Hall like a giant, wrinkled, sherbet lemon sucking, bad penny.' He paused. 'Know anything about veritaserum? Or, more specifically, how to resist it?'

'Couldn't find a book?' Fleur jibed.

'You're much prettier than a book and you smell nicer.' Fleur's lips quirked. 'Flattery will get you everywhere,

monCœur. It's a *very* powerful compulsion, it sedates the mind to sap will and focus, and creates a sense of trust to get the person to talk. If you can fight the sedation and keep your wits, then you can resist it, but the best way is the antidote.'

'Which you just happen to conveniently have?'

Fleur laughed. 'It takes a long time to brew and Maman doesn't have the licence for it.'

'Damn.'

'You will be fine.' She slipped a hand into his hair and gave it

a light tug. 'Because if you are not, I will melt your face off.'

Harry winced. 'And on that tender, loving note, I need to go.'

\'Go on then.\' Fleur scowled. \'You come visit me as soon as

you can, and now you owe me cake, too.'

\'Oh I do, do I?\' A smile spread across his lips as her scowl

morphed into a huge pout. \'I'll find you something sweet, mon Rêve.\' 'Marzipan,' Fleur ordered. 'And plums.'

'Of course, ma Princesse.' He stood up and bent to kiss Fleur goodbye. 'I'm sure that'll be an easy combination for me to find.'

'The harder it is to get, the more satisfying it is to get it.' She tangled her hands in his hair and held his mouth against hers. \'I was expecting you to stay,\' she murmured. \'I had *plans*.\'

'Sorry.' He kissed her once more. 'But you've got the whole

summer for *plans* now.'

Fleur's pout curved into a smirk. 'What an excellent idea.'

Harry shot her a grin and twisted the world past himself, reappearing in the study.

\'No vampires this time?\' Salazar asked.

\'No.\' Harry activated the Marauder\'s Map. 'It's time to sort things out before Fudge is deposed and I run out of time.'

\'Up to something nefarious?\' Salazar peered at the map.

\'I\'m going to encourage the caretaker to be nicer to the students.\' Harry grimaced. 'It's a good opportunity to test out my ability to modify memories; I would rather practise on someone who deserves anything that goes wrong.'

*And if I hear about him hitting another eleven year old girl afterward, I'll feed him to the giant squid in small pieces.* He spotted Filch patrolling the third floor, his name marker floating up and down the corridor as if he was pacing.

Harry set off at a brisk pace, spinning his wand around on his palm. Filch's name drifted down the stairs, so he tucked away the map and waited halfway down them.

\'What\'s this?\' Filch cackled. \'A student out on his own? Up to no good, I reckon.\'

\'Hello, Filch,\' Harry said.

'What are you up to, Potter?\' He snarled and clutched at his

broom. \'You think I\'ve forgotten what you did to my Mrs Norris?\' \'Legilimens,\' Harry whispered.

Harry tore through his mind, following the trail of hatred and resentment back to its birth half a century ago. The beaming visage of a young, dark-haired, pale-eyed girl wielded a wand in Ollivander\'s, surrounded by yellow sparks. She bathed in the pride of her parents while Filch watched on, forgotten, forlorn, and furious.

\'Obliviate,\' Harry murmured.

He purged every moment of bitterness, forcing every memory of watching magic to shift from discontent to calm

acceptance. Harry twisted the resentment toward the parents who'd ignored him rather than the sister who'd been driven away, then drew all the small moments in which she'd tried to help her brother to the front of Filch's mind.

*Let's see if that works.* He severed the connection.

*Otherwise, I'll have to get rid of him.*

Filch\'s eyes rolled up into his head and he slumped to the floor. Harry flicked his wand back into his sleeve, turned on his heel, and strode back in the direction of the chamber.

Dobby stumbled into the puddle of Myrtle's bathroom with

a loud crack.

\'Dobby?\' Harry asked.

Dobby slumped to the floor. Threads of red twisted their way across the surface of the puddle.

*Merde!* Harry turned the elf over.

A trio of deep, gaping cuts ran from Dobby's collarbone to his waist. Bone gleamed beneath bright blood. Harry muttered the healing charm, but the cuts refused to close no matter how much magic he poured into them.

\'Master Harry Potter,\' Dobby whispered. \'Dobby saved the students. Dobby saved them all.\'

Crimson blossomed across the white tiles. Harry watched it spread through the lines of grout and choked on a knot of thorns. 'Well done, Dobby.'

\'Dobby did well?\' Dobby blinked and shifted. A fresh wave of red gushed across the puddle. \'Dobby tried to do what Harry

Potter would have done, but the nasty pink teacher was faster than before.\'

forget.'

'You did well, Dobby.' He caught Dobby's hand. 'I won't

*But everyone else will.* A spot of ice spread across his chest;

it screamed Umbridge\'s name like the distant shriek of foxes in the night. *They'll celebrate they were saved and never even notice you're gone. You'll be nothing.* Harry smothered the words.

\'You\'re free forever now, Dobby,\' he murmured.

\'Free...\' A small smile curved Dobby's lips as his fingers slipped from Harry's arm. \'Dobby is free.\'

# For the Greater Good...

A bright, sun-lit sky spread over a flat, still stretch of water.

The pines bristled away over the rolling hills beyond it.

*Quite a nice day.* Harry watched the smoke rise up and drift across the lake, then slipped his wand back into his sleeve. *Everyone will wake up, look outside and be happy. And nobody will even notice Dobby's vanished.*

Freezing fury swirled through his veins and clenched its fist around his heart.

'Goodbye Dobby.' He watched the breeze snatch the last of the ashes away. 'You died a hero.'

*And Fleur's right about heroes: they die.*

Harry took a deep breath, then apparated back to the study in the chamber. He honed the ice in his chest to a razor sharp edge and cradled it close to his heart.

Salazar watched him pace back and forth past the desk.

'You burnt him?'

'I didn't like the idea of him being trapped under the dirt and rotting away.' Harry grabbed the Polyjuice. 'Now I'm going to give Umbridge a reason to come after me.'

'I never understood why the muggles insist on burying themselves.' Salazar ran a finger along the back of his serpent. 'Get *rid* of this woman, Harry. House elves are selfless, loyal, creatures, to kill one out of spite alone...'

'She's already gone.' He stalked the length of the chamber

past the glinting eyes of the serpent effigies.

A thick pool of red covered the bathroom floor. Myrtle wrung her pearl-white hands over the crimson, floating in small circles around its edge.

He vanished the blood.

'Harry!\' Myrtle swooped over. \'I thought something terrible

had happened to you.\'

\'It\'s not my blood.'

\'A student?\' Myrtle asked. \'Will I have company?\'

'I don\'t think so,\' Harry murmured. \'He\'s free now, he\'d have no desire to linger here and be bound to this world.\'

'It depends,\' Myrtle whispered. 'All it takes is a reason to

stay.'

'I don't think he'd want to stay.'

'No regrets?' She drifted to the entrance of the chamber and

peered down into the dark. 'No strange echoes of emotion? Nothing

*missing?*'

'He wanted to be free.' Harry sighed. 'He is.'

'Free,' Myrtle breathed, drifting past to the top step down

into the chamber. 'Free to disappear.'

'Not to the next great adventure? No well-earnt rest?\'

'There\'s nothing after death, Tom.' Myrtle's form shivered and flickered as she slid away into the wall. 'Once you let go, you fade away like the light of dying embers.'

*Tom?* The hairs prickled across the back of Harry's neck. He pushed it from his mind and seized hold of the sharp cold beneath his ribs. *No time to worry about that now. Umbridge has to go.*

Harry prowled through the corridors beneath his disillusionment charm to the door of Umbridge's office. Wards thrummed on the doorframe; small, crude, misshapen runes notched the frame.

*You'll vanish.* He slid his wand from his sleeve, honing his hate to a sharp edge. *I'll eradicate every trace.*

Harry thrust his wand out and poured cherry-red fiendfyre into the room. The wards melted like frost. The lurid, pink carpet burst into flames, releasing billows of acrid smoke. He forced the fire hotter and scourged everything from the stone, then extinguished the flames with a slash of his wand.

Orange-glowing stones shimmered, wreathed in heat-haze, molten mortar wept from between them, and ashes drifted down to the floor. A soft satisfaction swelled within him. He bent and etched his message into the floor in purple flame.

*For the Greater Good*. Harry stared at the words. *And for revenge. Because it's people like you that ought to vanish, not ones like Dobby.*

'And now I wait.'

He strode back to the Great Hall and took a seat, watching Umbridge's smug smile out of the corner of his eye. *You're not going to be smiling for much longer.* He smothered the yearning to see the

moment arrive and sliced the pastry off a slice of chicken, ham, and leek pie with the very tip of his knife.

Malfoy slunk into the hall and approached the dais. The warped, scorched sole of his right boot let off little wisps of smoke as he bent to Umbridge's ear and whispered.

Her face turned bright red and a vein throbbed in her temple. 'Professor Snape! I want every last drop of veritaserum in my office. Immediately!' She sputtered and clutched at her handbag. 'And bring *Potter* with you. He's behind this. He and Dumbledore are behind all of it!'

\'Very well. Malfoy, escort Potter to Professor Umbridge's

office.\' Snape left in a swirl of black robes.

*Snape probably didn't even bat an eyelash at Filch beating*

*first years.*

\'Now, Mr Potter,\' Umbridge hissed.

Harry shot Katie a small smile as he stood. She frowned at him and squirmed on her seat, her lips pressed into a thin, white line. He gave her a little wave and strode back toward Umbridge's office.

Malfoy and the members of the Inquisitorial Squad flanked him, trailing after him with their wands in their hands.

Snape lurked by the entrance to the classroom holding a clear vial. A small smirk graced his lips as he stepped in ahead of them. \'There is enough veritaserum in this vial for every student on that list.\' He sneered. 'There are no children with the strength to fight off even a single drop.'

\'I have to be sure,\' Umbridge snapped. \'Will it be enough?\'

\'It takes considerable mental strength to fight the effects of veritaserum. It would be a very rare student who was capable of it.\' Snape threw a long look at Harry. 'Three drops ought to be more than enough.'

'Very well.' Umbridge snatched the vial from him and

poured three drops into a pewter goblet.

'May I ask what\'s happening?' Harry enquired.

'Drink up, Mr Potter,' Umbridge instructed. 'We shall discuss what\'s happening at length and in great detail.'

'I look forward to it.' Harry smothered a smile and tipped the veritaserum onto his tongue; it burnt like he\'d pressed his tongue against ice and an odd numb crept down his throat, then seeped through him.

*Emptiness.* Harry almost laughed. *This faint numb is*

*sedation? It has no hunger. No bite. It's nothing.* He crushed it.

'Allow a few seconds for it to take effect,' Snape said. 'A test question is advisable to begin with, something simple.'

'What is your name?' Umbridge demanded.

A strange sense of trust rose up, a desire to spill everything surging through him. 'Harry James Potter.'

\'Where were you this morning?\' She glanced at the blackened, heat-warped remnants of her office.

\'Hogwarts,\' Harry let the compulsion drive his tongue. \'Specifically?\' Snape drawled. A small smirk hovered at the

corner of his lips.

*Damn him. He suspects.* He squashed the compulsion.

\'Gryffindor Tower.' He kept his tone flat and even.

A broad grin spread across Umbridge's pallid face. \'Where's

Dumbledore?\'

Harry smothered a quiet sense of triumph. *It\'s almost too*

*easy*.

\'I have no idea,\' he said.

\'Have you attended any meetings of this *Dumbledore\'s*

*Army* organisation, since the first?\' \'No,\' he droned.

Umbridge\'s face fell. Snape\'s eyebrows rose into his

hairline.

*Not good. He knows I might be lying.*

\'Why did you not attend any meetings?\' Umbridge pressed.

'Surely these students are *your* sort.'

'I wasn't welcome, not after all the stuff that was written about me. They said it would put people off from joining.'

\'Did you destroy my office?\' Umbridge glowered. 'Did you?!'

*Yes. I razed every trace of you from the school but yourself.* He stilled his cold fury before it reached his face. *And I'll get rid of you soon, too.*

\'No,' he said.

\'You may go, Potter,\' she spat. \'Mr Malfoy, if you would be so kind as to fetch\... Mr Smith.'

Harry lingered outside the door for a moment.

\'You want to check Potter\'s answers against another, more insignificant member?\' Snape asked.

'I want to know what the list *really* is.' Umbridge's heels clicked back and forth beyond the wall. 'If Potter wasn't directly involved because the founders thought he was bad for their reputation, then I'll have to ask someone else who *was* there.'

'I can't imagine there's anything more to that piece of paper than the names and a particularly childish jinx to punish anyone who betrays the group.'

Harry pulled out the Marauder's Map. Zacharias Smith's

name floated at one end of the Hufflepuff table.

*Polyjuice time.* He set off at a brisk pace. *I'll have to go out into the forest as myself, I won't be able to impersonate an auror or something similarly clever.*

He paused at the doors to the Great Hall. \'Imperio.' His will

seeped through Smith.

The boy rose, drifted from the end of his table, then followed Harry into a broom closet. Harry stunned and disillusioned him, then tugged a couple of hairs out of his head and dropped them into the vial of Polyjuice; it shifted to a sludge-like brown. Pinching his nose, he downed the potion.

A fierce heat spread across his body, burning just beneath his skin. His bones twisted and shifted, his skin rippling like liquid

wax, and muscles melted away from under his skin. Harry clenched his jaw and waited it out.

*I hope Fleur's change doesn't hurt like this.*

He checked his reflection in the window. Then he charmed his robes, changing their size and colour to match Smith's.

Malfoy spotted him and dragged him off the bench before he'd managed to put his weight on it. \'The Headmistress wants to speak with you, Smith.'

Crabbe and Goyle took an arm each and half-marched, half- carried him down the corridor.

\'Mr Smith.' Umbridge simpered and pushed a plain china

cup full of steaming tea in his direction.

*No doubt full of veritaserum.* He eyed the tea and picked out a thin, clear film of liquid over the top. *She didn't even mix it in to hide it. It's just been poured on top.*

\'Have a drink, Mr Smith. Relax, you\'re not in any trouble. I just want to ask you about some of the members of that group you were part of. They\'ve done a great deal of criminal damage to Hogwarts and my own possessions.\'

Harry picked up the tea cup and took a sip. Hot, sweet tea and the ice of the veritaserum slid down his throat.

\'What's your full name?\' Umbridge asked.

Harry pictured the name from the Marauders' Map. \'It\'s just Zacharias Smith.' He took another cautious sip of tea.

\'So how many meetings of this group did you go to?\' she

asked.

\'There was only one meeting.\'

\'That\'s good. What did you plan to do at the meetings?\' \'We wanted to practice magic,\' Harry said. \'I was afraid I

wouldn\'t be able to pass my OWLs otherwise.\'

\'You\'re right to be concerned, the exams are very important.\' Umbridge nodded. \'But you must be careful who you listen to.\'

'Of course, professor.' Harry took another gulp of the tea, which had cooled to reach that small window between scalding and icy.

'How was the group organised?'

'The DA was run by Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, and Ron Weasley, but several different students were going to teach; whoever could help, really.' He paused for a moment. 'They had a big list with all the names on.\'

\'What was the list?\' Umbridge purred.

\'It had all the names on and some magic to stop anyone from ratting us out.\' He wrinkled his brow as if in thought. 'But they were very careful with it. I think it was more important than that.' He glanced around, then took a sip of tea. 'I listened in when they were hiding it.'

Umbridge leant forward with baited breath. A gleam of

triumph hovered in her eyes. 'What did they say?'

*Good thing Snape left, he wouldn't believe any of this for a*

*second.*

'They said it was a map,' Harry whispered. 'There was a

phrase to reveal it, one Dumbledore gave them.'

\'Do you know the phrase?\' Umbridge pried open her handbag, clawing out her wand, the vial of veritaserum, a small notebook, the chittering diadem from the Room of Requirement, and the list.

\'I *think* so.' He screwed his face up. 'It was...'

\'Take your time,\' Umbridge cooed.

\'For the Greater Good,\' Harry murmured.

*And for revenge.*

\'For the Greater Good.\' Umbridge tapped her wand on the list. She scowled and flipped the page over. \'For the Greater Good.'

The rough map revealed itself.

\'Oh, yes,\' she breathed. \'Thank you, Mr Smith. You may go, just remember to be much more careful about who you listen to in the future.\'

*Oh I will.* He smothered a small, thin smile, stepped out and disillusioned himself, then crept back in. *Perhaps you should've done the same.*

Umbridge plucked the circlet from the floor and placed it on her brows, cocking her head. 'Yes. Yes...' She snatched a handful of floo powder and tossed it into the flames. 'Dawlish. Come at once and bring a partner.' She paused. 'No don\'t bother telling Amelia Bones, there\'s no time, this is of critical importance to the Minister.\'

Harry wandered back toward the Great Hall. The clicking of Umbridge's heels as she paced her classroom faded behind him. *One more step on the road, Umbridge. One more perceived victory. Then ruin.*

# ...But Mostly for Revenge

Harry poked around the floor of the broom closet with a foot, bumping a bucket and several mops before his toes brushed something soft and warm.

*Now, how to do this?* He dragged Smith up onto his shoulder. *I guess I'll have to improvise. It usually works.*

Harry stepped out of the broom closet and wandered down toward the Hufflepuff common room.

\'Zach.\' A tall, pompous-looking Hufflepuff gave him a nod, then wandered across. \'The whole school\'s being locked down, we\'ve got to go back to our common rooms and stay there until further notice. What\'s happening? What did Umbridge want?\'

\'She gave me a cup of tea and asked me some questions,\' Harry said.

\'Oh? What about? I heard she talked to Potter, too.\' \'Someone set fire to her office, burnt the whole thing

completely clean.\'

\'That explains why there're aurors here and we\'re all being shut in.\' Smith\'s friend frowned and knocked on a barrel a few times. \'Saw them come in through the hall a few minutes back. Went right after Umbridge without a word.\'

\'Well, if they find whoever did it, he or she\'s in trouble,\' Harry said. \'I daresay the only things Umbridge has left are in her handbag.\'

\'Good riddance to all that bloody pink. Did she actually make you take veritaserum?\'

\'The tea.\' Harry feigned shock. \'It could've been in the tea. It

did taste weird.\'

\'That *must* be illegal.\' Smith\'s friend paused before a cosy gathering of chairs and sofas. \'I\'m going to ask Cedric about it.\'

\'I think I\'m going to lie down,\' Harry said. \'I\'m starting to get a serious headache.\'

\'It\'s probably because of what that woman made you drink.

I\'m definitely talking to Cedric about it.\'

Harry nodded, hanging back until everyone\'s eyes moved away and slipping upstairs to hunt through the rooms for Smith's. He dumped Smith on the bed beneath his name and dispelled the disillusionment charm on him, drawing the hangings closed around the bed.

\'Obliviate,\' he murmured, feeding an abridged version of his memories of the conversation with Umbridge into the blank in Smith's mind after lunch.

He disillusioned himself, ducked out of the hangings on the far side, and crept out of the Hufflepuff common room.

Heat flared across his body, then everything began to shift.

Harry gritted his teeth, staggering out of the Hufflepuff Common Room and into the first dark corner, undoing the charms on his robes. He ground his forehead into the wall, holding his breath until his bones squirmed back into place and his muscles stopped writhing.

*I'm never doing that again.* He gulped down a mouthful of cold air. *I'd rather transfigure my entire body.*

Harry slipped back into Gryffindor Tower and joined the huddle of people 'round the fire. 'Someone set fire to Umbridge\'s office.'

\'She thought it was you?\' Nev asked.

Hermione pursed her lips. '*Was* it you?'

\'I wish it had been me, but I\'m tired and not feeling well. I don't know what's in Umbridge's teabags, but that cup of tea didn't agree with me at all.'

'You *drank* it.' Hermione's voice climbed an octave. 'It had

*veritaserum* in it, Harry. What did you tell her!'

'I don't remember it too well. She asked me where Dumbledore was, but I've no idea, so we kind of just went in circles.' Harry feigned a yawn. 'Now I'm going to go sleep.'

Nev nodded. 'Veritaserum's powerful stuff. Hope you feel better tomorrow, mate.'

Harry unfolded the Marauders\' Map and traced Umbridge\'s name drifting toward Hagrid\'s Hut, accompanied by two names whom he assumed were the pair of aurors she'd summoned. *It\'s finally time.*

Harry pulled the bed-curtains closed, cast a sticking charm on them, and opened the window. He eyed the drop. *This is a terrible idea.* He glanced around the wall for handholds, but there were only open windows. *My firebolt*.

He checked the dormitories for Katie and found her name in the common room. Umbridge and the aurors names' floated into the edge of the Forbidden Forest where the map ended.

Harry edged out onto the ledge. 'Accio Firebolt.'

His broom zipped out of the window a few floors up and slapped into his outstretched hand. He swung a leg over it, disillusioned himself, and dived. The wind rushed past him as he corkscrewed over the greenhouses and courtyards to Hagrid's pumpkin patch. He tucked the broom out of sight between two large pumpkins and hurried into the forest.

Dead pine needles and branches crunched under Umbridge\'s short, loud stomps, echoing beneath the branches. Twigs snapped beneath her aurors' boots as they crept along the forest path, casting beams of light through the gloom from their wands.

Dawlish's face appeared between the trees and Umbridge's pink

cardigan drifted a short distance behind.

*No need for me to tangle with the aurors. I just have to make sure they get separated from Umbridge.*

Harry tracked the three of them through the woods as the pines grew dense, the trunks thicker, and the arching roots rose up to his waist.

\'I\'m telling you this is a bad idea,' Dawlish's partner said.

\'We\'re aurors, King,\' Dawlish muttered. \'We follow our orders to keep people safe. If we don't follow orders, everything falls apart.\'

\'This isn\'t keeping anyone safe as far as I can see,\' King said. \'We\'ve been sent into an area well-known for being inhabited by some of the most dangerous magical creatures in Britain and she hasn\'t even told us *why*.\'

\'I\'m sure Dolores has a good reason, King.' Dawlish glanced back. 'I *hope* she has a good reason.'

\'What do *you* think we\'re doing out here, then?\'

\'If Dolores is risking herself to come out here, then it must be important,\' Dawlish said.

\'Important to her and Fudge,\' King replied.

\'Yes,\' Dawlish said. \'I\'m sure *you* would see it that way.\' \'What do you mean?\'

The pair split up to walk around one of the trees. Harry checked Umbridge's line of sight, then drifted a little closer.

\'We\'ve been working together for the best part of a decade, King,\' Dawlish said. \'I know whose ideals you follow. Don\'t think I haven\'t noticed you disappearing off at odd times.\'

\'I\'m afraid I have no idea what you\'re talking about,\' King

said.

\'Don\'t worry, King, you\'re an excellent auror. I don\'t care if

you\'re a member of Dumbledore's covert little group, anything to get Fudge out before Madam Bones decides to start a military coup just to be rid of his incompetence.\'

Harry cursed under his breath. *Of course, King had to be a member of the Order of the Phoenix.* He slipped ahead of them, hurrying along. *This has to look natural, then.*

'Time to improvise,' he murmured.

Harry picked his way through the trees, glancing back at the beams of light flashing over his shoulder until he reached the first span of spider webbing. He disillusioned it and all the webbing within sight, following Hagrid's path all the way to Aragog's hollow.

The shadows of acromantula crawled up and down the massive trunks above him.

*I may regret this.* A small smile crept across his lips. *Fleur may end up melting my face.*

He revealed himself. Furious clicking erupted around him and gargantuan arachnids descended to surround him.

\'So, friend of Hagrid, you've returned.\' The ancient, milk- eyed acromantula patriarch stalked out from the roots of the largest pine. \'I remember your last visit well.\'

*So do I.* Harry recalled the mad dash through the trees and the horde of man-eating spiders on his heels with a wry smile. *Let's hope it goes a bit better this time.*

\'Are you going to try and eat me again?\' he asked.

\'My children are always hungry,\' Aragog murmured. \'But no. My family owes you a great debt, slayer-of-the-creature-we-do-not- speak-of. Hagrid told me of your deed, you freed my old friend from his prison with your actions and saved my children from the creature\'s hunger.\'

\'A debt,\' Harry mused.

\'Yes,\' Aragog whispered. \'A debt. However, you did not know of it until now. Why have you come?\'

\'I have a deal for you and your children,\' Harry said.

\'A deal...\' Aragog clicked his pincers and stalked closer,

looming over Harry.

\'Fulfilment of your debt, if you like.'

\'What would you have from my family, friend of spiders?\' \'There was a wizard who was once known as Tom Riddle---\'

\'I know of Tom Riddle,\' Aragog hissed. \'He expelled me from my home, destroyed the future Hagrid had planned.\'

*Well, that makes things much easier.*

\'He unleashed the basilisk I slew and he goes by a new name now. He calls himself Voldemort and seeks to dominate Britain.\'

\'You would have us fight him,\' Aragog murmured. \'We are hunters and ambushers. We live amongst webs and shadows.

Outside our forest we'll be little more than a shield against spells. I

will not condemn my children to such a fate.\'

\'I ask you and your family to guard the forest against him, to agree never to aid or join with him, no matter what he offers or how long he lives.\' Harry slipped his wand away. \'If you agree, then I will hold your oath fulfilled... and as a gesture of friendship, I will hunt with you.\'

\'I agree.\' Aragog clicked his pincers. \'You ask for little in return for the freedom you have gifted us. When will you hunt with us?\'

Harry smiled. \'We already are.\' \'Where is our prey?\'

\'Walking toward us, lured into the middle of your web, into this very clearing. A trio whom I can offer one of to you and your children.\'

\'Only one?\' Aragog's pincers trembled. 'Why only one?'

\'The other two must live. They are unknowing allies.\' Harry watched the acromantula ascend back into the trees.

\'I have told my children that you are one of our family, just as Hagrid is,\' Aragog said. \'I accept your hunt.\'

Harry strode forward under the spider's belly and crouched in the shadows of the hollow beneath the largest pine. 'The female in pink is your prey. Scare the others off and I will ensure she is trapped here.'

Aragog rose onto his rear legs and waved both forelimbs and pincers in the air, clicking his mandibles together so fast it sounded almost like gunfire. 'My children will chase the others away, we will deal with the one in pink.'

Footsteps drew near through the trees. Harry's heart picked

up its beat and a great swell of anticipation rose within him.

*Almost there.* He peered out round the roots. *Withno more*

*Umbridge, I'm free to go after the prophecy.*

The two aurors spread out, pacing the edge of the clearing, their wands levelled at the shadows lying among the roots.

Umbridge stumbled to the clearing's centre, the map

clutched in one hand. \'For the Greater Good,\' she cried.

*Yes.* Harry watched the acromantula descend from above with a small, thin smile. *But mostly for revenge.*

King swore. 'Run! Dawlish! Umbridge!'

Dawlish banished a spider away into the trees and conjured a shining shield of magic. King threw up a gleaming barrier beside

him. Acromantula bounced off them and rolled across the ground and Umbridge shrieked, sprinting for the silver light.

\'Ossasula,\' Harry whispered.

The dark purple curse hissed through the air and struck Umbridge on the ankle. A loud snap echoed through the clearing and she dropped with a scream. The spiders swarmed over her. Dawlish and King exchanged a look, then turned and ran, the acromantula thundering after them.

\'Filthy spiders,\' Umbridge screeched, pressing her glowing wand tip to her leg. She fired red curses into the shadows around her, clutching at her ankle. 'Disgusting creatures!'

Harry strolled out from the hollow. \'I see you followed the

map I made.'

\'Dumbledore,\' she spat. \'You\'ll suffer for this, for consorting with such *things.*\'

\'Dumbledore?\' Harry drifted a little closer.

*\'Potter*,\' she breathed. \'I am the *headmistress* of Hogwarts, *undersecretary to the Minister for Magic.* You will be expelled, your wand snapped, and then you'll be sent to Azkaban for the rest of your life. It will only take a word from me and you will be *destroyed*.\'

A small, cold, thin smile curved Harry's lips. \'You seem to be under the delusion you\'re leaving this forest.'

A crazed, desperate gleam rose in her eyes and she snatched the tiara from her handbag, clapping it onto her head. 'Yes,' she muttered, dropping the bag to the dirt. 'Yes.'

Harry glanced at her handbag. *I'll leave it. Hagrid might find*

*it to prove she was eaten here.*

A white curse flashed past him and carved deep gashes into the trunk of a tree. Harry deflected the second curse away into the ground and stepped closer to her.

\'Crucio,\' she hissed.

A single butterfly fluttered from the tip of Harry's wand and

swallowed the red light, bursting in a wisp of dark vapour.

\'Lacero,\' he murmured, advancing over the ground. 'Lacero.'

The first purple curse ripped through her cardigan as Umbridge rolled away. The second tore a line across her forearm, splattering blood across the pine needles. Her short wand slipped from her stubby fingers.

'No,' she shrieked, grabbing her wand and dragging herself

away through the needles.

'Ossasula.' Harry's curse fractured her pelvis with a loud

snap.

Her hoarse scream tore through the trees and Umbridge

clawed her way through the dirt toward the path, sobbing and muttering beneath her breath. Her soiled pink cardigan and skirt dragged countless dead needles in their weave. A loud crack echoed through the trees and she reappeared a few metres away.

*Apparition.* A chill lanced through Harry.

He strode after her and stamped on her wand, crunching it to pieces beneath his heel, and flipped her over with his foot. Thick lines of tears dribbled down her pale, mud-smeared, flabby face.

'Please,' she whispered, clutching at the tiara with both hands, smearing blood from her wrist over her right cheek. 'Please, *help me*.'

'There\'s no help coming.' Harry pried the map from her and tapped it. \'Sometimes, when something seems too good to be true, it\'s because it is.\'

Her eyes widened, then the blood drained from her face.

Aragog stalked from the depths of the hollow. 'This is our

prey?'

her.'

'She\'s yours now.' Harry glanced back over his shoulder. 'Kill

\'We spiders don't kill our prey so quickly.\' Aragog's hoarse

laugh echoed through the clearing. \'We keep them still, warm, and breathing, feasting for as long as they last.\'

Umbridge whimpered and the sour smell of urine filled the hollow. The other acromantula returned, scuttling from the shadows.

'I thank you for your gift,\' Aragog whispered. A brief flurry of clicking echoed from the trees around the hollow. 'My children say the other two have fled the forest unharmed. Our hunt is successful, friend of spiders. I and my children will defend the forest from Tom Riddle and those who follow him.' He lunged past Harry and seized Umbridge in his pincers.

She gurgled, then flopped to the floor as limp as a drowned

worm, and the tiara slipped from her head, rolling to Harry's feet.

\'Curious...\' He bent down and retrieved it, brushing the dirt

and needles away.

Aragog smothered Umbridge in webbing, then dropped her to the floor and let another spider carry her up into the trees, dangling her on a single rope of spider silk.

*Are you worth keeping?* Harry polished the tiara on his robes and turned it over until he found writing etched in a ring around the sapphire. *Wit beyond measure is Man\'s greatest treasure*.

'Cute.'He weighed the circlet on his palm, letting its warmth soak into his hand, and it shuddered, letting out a soft chitter. 'Silver and sapphire.' Fleur's bright blue eyes and her shimmering Yule dress flashed through his mind and the tiara hummed. 'I think I'll keep you.'

# Resilience

Whispers filled the Great Hall from the floor to the grey, overcast clouds floating across the ceiling, growing louder with each teacher that drifted to the staff table without the loathed click of pink heels.

'I heard the curse got her,' Seamus muttered.

'Maybe someone pushed her off the moving staircases,' Dean suggested. 'Like Sally-Anne Perks.'

'Sally-Anne *left.'* Hermione sighed. 'The aurors almost certainly came after Umbridge started using veritaserum on students.' She glanced at Harry. 'Being given too much can do some nasty things to you. I read about it last night...'

Katie took his wrist. 'How much did she make you drink?' 'Three drops.' He patted her hand. 'I'm fine.'

Katie's lips twisted. 'I'm keeping an eye on you.'

'You just want an excuse to ogle me.' He grinned at her. 'I'm onto you.'

She twitched. 'Oh?' Katie reached for the jug and knocked

her goblet over. 'You are, are you?'

'Definitely. All those jokes\... The teasing... You're an

*incorrigible* flirt.'

She laughed and stood her goblet back up. 'Congratulations, Harry. You've seen right through me.'

'You know what I think.' Lavender tucked her lip gloss into her cleavage and giggled when Ron's eyes followed it down. 'I think Professor Umbridge left her office to meet up in the greenhouses with Filch for a midnight tryst, only to be snatched and consumed by the Venomous Tentacula.'

'Some girls are into that sort of thing,' Katie whispered in Harry's ear. 'All those snaky green vines everywhere. Could be a lot of fun...'

'Doesn't it digest things while they're still alive?' Harry asked. 'Can't imagine *that's* fun.'

Katie shrugged. 'No idea. I hate Herbology.'

Professor McGonagall rose to her feet. \'As you are all aware, Professor Umbridge is no longer at the school. She is unlikely to be returning, so I will be stepping in as headmistress until the summer.\'

A cheer rose from the four tables, sparks were launched into the air from upraised wands, and Katie's elbow sent her goblet flying, splashing water over Harry's breakfast.

'What deep-seated issue do you have with goblets?' he

asked.

'None.' Katie beamed, then stole the one slice of bacon she

hadn't drenched. 'I'm *all* daddy issues.'

Harry snorted. 'Is that why you're such a tomboy? Trying to be the son he never got?'

Katie cocked her head. 'You know, that might actually be

true. He did want a boy to begin with.'

'Sorry.' Harry grimaced.

'What're best friends for, if not diagnosing psychological issues?' Katie offered him the toast rack.

Harry shook his head. 'I don't think I have any.'

Katie's eyes lingered on him, then she snagged a slice of

toast. 'Harry, my love, you have *loads*.'

'My love?' He raised his eyebrows. 'Shall I call you darling, Katie dearest?'

'I don't mind.' She turned a little red and lowered her voice to a whisper. 'Not if Frenchie won't set you on fire for it.' She took a huge bite out of her toast and munched on it. 'And who's going to tell her, me? Nope. My lips are sealed. I'm *your* best friend, not hers.'

'Fair enough.' Harry poked her in the cheek. 'You have butter on your nose, Katie darling.'

\'So what do you think happened, Harry?\' Ron asked.

\'Hermione's usually right,\' he said. \'The use of veritaserum on children would've probably earnt her a long and unpleasant holiday in Azkaban once Magical Law Enforcement heard about it.\'

\'It\'s no less than she deserves,\' Ron muttered, clenching his fist 'round his fork so tight it turned white. \'If scum like her weren\'t corrupting the Ministry...\'

*And if Dumbledore hadn't sent him into danger for no reason.* Harry sighed. *He doesn't want or need my pity, it changes nothing.*

'What are you up to today?' Katie asked. 'Want to make use

of your sudden freedom and come to Hogsmeade with me? I need

someone to carry stuff for me since Alicia and Angelina are ditching

me for their boyfriends.'

'So I'm your stand-in?' Harry laughed. 'No, I'm going to dust off my reputation as a dark wizard and do some creepy ritual magic.'

Katie beamed. 'Can I come?'

'It's a date...' He drummed his fingers on the table. 'No, I think I might nip off elsewhere today.'

She pouted. 'I just can't win, can I?' 'Next time.'

*I need to ask Salazar about healing magic and do the next ritual.* Harry counted the days. *I should have enough time to recover before it's time to go after the prophecy.*

'Fine.' Katie shoved the rest of her toast into her mouth. 'You can all ditch me to go mess around, I'll go flying.' She swung her legs over the bench and stormed off.

*Oops.* A small knot tightened in his stomach as he watched her go. *I'll make it up to her by going next weekend.*

Harry headed for the chamber.

Myrtle drifted in circles through the cubicles, her hands pressed to her temples and her eyes screwed shut. 'Don't keep a lady waiting,' she whispered. 'Don't keep a lady waiting.'

Harry frowned, then shook his head and hurried down into the chamber. \'Salazar, I\'m back.'

\'How is the *illustrious* headmistress?\'

\'She\'s a little tied up.\' Harry recalled her tear-streaked, pale face peeking out through the cocoon of webbing as she'd been hauled up into the trees with a grin. 'Very tied up.'

Salazar scowled. \'Not dead? That woman ought to be dead. A spiteful, slimy creature like that will only stick a knife in your back if you show her mercy, and even if she never gets the chance to hurt *you,* she'll manage to hurt someone else.'

\'Acromantula keep their prey alive while they eat,\' Harry replied. 'Aragog and his family will leave little more than bones and that lurid pink cardigan.\'

\'Good.' Salazar steered the head of his serpent away from under his chin. \'Now there's no obstacle between you and the Department of Mysteries.\'

\'I intend to complete the next ritual before going,\' Harry said.

\'I'll speak to Sirius, too.\'

'Come to make another small sacrifice...' Salazar's eyes darkened. 'Remember, Harry, to measure the price of victory before you commit to paying it.'

Harry rolled his eyes. 'You *recommended* this ritual, you senile self-portrait.' He levitated the ingredients for the ritual off the desk, then grabbed the time-turner. 'I can start to recover from the ritual before I even do it.'

Salazar nodded. 'Take me with you, too. I can't help you with the runes, but if you have questions....'

Harry hauled him off the wall and carried him over the bridge into the main chamber. The jar of salamander\'s blood, the gryphon\'s claw, and the shimmering unicorn tail hair floated after him.

\'Three triangles,\' Salazar instructed. \'Draw them so each triangle has two points shared with the other triangles. That way your three triangles form another triangle between them at the centre.\'

Harry inscribed the design on the floor in purple flames.

'Simpler than the other one?'

\'It\'s actually a less complex ritual,\' Salazar said. \'You\'re improving the existing template of your body by increasing what\'s already there. It\'s like having a number, then tripling it. The other ritual required you to rewrite the template of your body to fix your eyes. You had to erase the number and make a new one.\'

*Makes sense.*

\'Before I do this, can you teach me how to heal myself?\' Harry asked. \'I don\'t want to stagger down to see Madam Pomfrey again. She might start to worry if I keep turning up with the same injury on my forearm all the time.\'

\'Of course.' Salazar frowned. \'I should've made sure you

could do this a long time ago.\'

\'Where do I begin?\'

\'The first thing you need to know is the better your grasp of human biology the better your healing spell will be. You can intend to heal someone, but the more you know about what you actually want your magic to do, the better your focus will be and the more efficient the spell.\'

Harry flicked his wand into his palm.

Salazar shook his head. \'No point practising now, you\'re about to injure yourself anyway. The incantation you want to heal cuts or lacerations is vulnerasanentur, for bones, use ossiosanentur.\'

\'What're they capable of healing?\' Harry enquired.

\'For you, probably all but the worst cuts or breaks. You've strong intent and focus, but I'd still suggest reading up on anatomy. These spells won\'t do much for burns, though, nor injuries that are resistant to magic.\'

\'Best to avoid them all in the first place, really.' \'Exactly. And I'd suggest improving your knowledge of

human biology if you want to be able to competently heal anyone

other than yourself. Your mind and magic have a subconscious, inherent image of how you should be which can act as a focus, so strong intent is often enough. It\'s a lot less effective on others without that subliminal source of focus to direct your magic.\'

\'I see.' Harry scratched his chin. \'For now, I\'m happy just

being able to fix myself after this ritual.\'

\'It\'s something I pursued for the same reason,\' Salazar said. \'Blood magic is always expensive and I did more than dabble.\'

Harry etched the runes for the ritual in three concentric circles around the triangle, glancing back and forth at the page. *Some of these have different meanings in this book than they do in my books.*

mused.

\'There're a lot of threes for this ritual, but no sevens,\' Harry

\'Three threes is a very powerful magical combination,\'

Salazar replied. \'It\'s one of the most powerful combinations feasible,

exceeded only by seven threes, three sevens, and seven sevens in that order.\'

\'Feasible?\' Harry stepped back to admire his handiwork, pausing to correct a few less than perfectly drawn glyphs.

\'Every time you increase the number combinations the effects are also improved. Having three threes of three would be more powerful than three threes, but the difference quickly becomes negligible when compared to your objective.'

\'So if I were to draw another three triangles around this, then it would be more powerful.\'

\'That would be six threes,\' Salazar said. \'You\'d have to create a three-sided pyramid by drawing those runes in the air around you and levitating your blood.' He cracked a wide grin. \'I tried it once. Took me a fair few days to recover, but I was never hungover again. The look on Godric\'s face the next morning after I woke up as usual was *patronus-worthy.*\'

\'Is it worth doing for this ritual?' Harry asked.

\'No. There aren't many rituals where the end result *needs* it.

Maybe next time,\' Salazar consoled him.

A faint stab of disappointment struck him. *Maybe.*

\'I\'d best get on with this ritual, then.' Harry placed his

ingredients at the apex of every triangle.

\'I\'d suggest not carrying the time-turner during the ritual,\' Salazar said.

Harry slipped the small, golden hourglass out of his pocket and placed it on the floor well out of the way, then drew his wand.

'And you should speak to your godfather before doing this, just in case you collapse afterwards.\'

\'Any other suggestions,\' Harry muttered. \'Or would you like to wait and list them one at a time to annoy me as much as possible.\'

\'Ungrateful child,\' Salazar snapped. \'If you weren\'t family, I\'d have half a mind to let you carry out the ritual with a time-turner on you to see what happened.\'

\'I\'d probably end up in my eleven year old body,\' Harry quipped. \'Forewarned and vastly more powerful than I was before. Voldemort wouldn\'t stand a chance.\'

Salazar snorted. \'Get on with it, you don\'t have all day.\' Harry stuck out one hand and summoned the mirror with a

grin.

'You get far too much joy out of being able to do that,'

Salazar muttered. 'Godric used to do the exact same thing. The idiot tried to use it on a gryphon and it dragged him through the lake because it was more powerful than his spell.'

\'Sirius,\' Harry murmured, angling the mirror away from

Salazar's portrait.

Sirius's grey eyes appeared. Dark bags hung beneath them. \'Harry. You\'re okay. We were all worried.\'

\'You were?\'

\'Of course!\' Sirius frowned. \'With Dumbledore gone,

nobody's been able to keep Dolores Umbridge in check.\'

\'She\'s gone,\' Harry said. \'McGonagall didn\'t say why, but she openly used veritaserum on children, and even Fudge can\'t condone or ignore that.\'

\'What Fudge does or doesn\'t condone scarcely matters now, the Wizengamot is fighting over who will take his place according to our sources.\' Sirius's lips curled back into a sneer. 'If I ever find myself near that absolute *cunt*, I will rip his lungs out with my bare teeth.\'

Harry blinked. 'Are *you* okay?'

Sirius let out a sharp sigh. 'My cousin and her husband were killed a few days ago. It was covered up as an accident by the Ministry, but even without the Dark Mark we all fucking know what happened. Little Nym puts on a brave face, but she's falling apart.'

Harry grimaced. 'I don't know if Dumbledore doesn't realise putting people in harm's way gets them killed or if he just doesn't care.'

'I don't give a flying fuck at this point.' Sirius took a deep breath. \'I've planned our trip to the Ministry, Harry. You\'ll come to Grimmauld Place, if Umbridge is really gone then you can just floo here. I can apparate us to the entrance of the Ministry and then we can go in with me under James\'s cloak. The door probably isn\'t easy to get past, but I'm sure we'll manage something.\'

\'What about the guard from the Order?\' Harry asked. \'Old Mundungus has the evening shift, stops him getting

into trouble in bars or down Knockturn Alley after dark. We wouldn't

use him for important stuff, normally, but we're low on members.\'

\'So any evening,\' Harry said.

\'As long as it\'s after six,\' Sirius replied. \'It\'s Emmeline Vance before then and I can\'t bribe her. But the sooner the better. Arthur, Ted, Andi... The longer Voldemort's left to slither about in hiding the more of us will start disappearing again.\'

\'Sooner? So if I came tomorrow, you'd be ready?\'

\'I would leave now if I could, Harry,\' Sirius muttered. \'I *hate* this place. I grew up here and my childhood is the only period of my life comparable to my time in Azkaban. The only thing Grimmauld Place needs to equal that place is dementors, and my mother\'s portrait is most of the way to being one.\'

\'You want to get out.\'

\'I *need* to get out,\' Sirius said. \'I can\'t stay here and let everyone else fight.\'

\'I understand.'

\'I know you do. You were right about Dumbledore. I feel more and more that he tells us only what he thinks we need to know when he thinks we need to know it. He's buggered off without telling us anything.' Sirius shook his head. A shadow lingered in his grey eyes, the same darkness that'd swirled there when Harry first met him. 'I make my own decisions and my own mistakes, I have since the day I was burnt off my family tree, and I won\'t stop now.\'

\'I\'ll floo over when I\'m ready.\' Harry glanced at the purple flames on the floor of the chamber and the time-turner. 'It won't be long, tomorrow or the day after.\'

*I can get two long uses of the time-turner in, plus the usual*

*day, that's almost thirty six hours.*

\'The sooner the better.'

\'Should I use the mirror to warn you?\' Harry asked.

\'I like surprises.\' Sirius shrugged. \'Nobody will be here except Kreacher and my mother\'s portrait. Nobody listens to my mother, they didn\'t listen when she was alive, either, and I\'ll order Kreacher not to speak about your visit.\'

'Then I\'ll be seeing you soon.' 'Be careful, Harry.'

Harry ended the connection and put the mirror down outside the runes. *I\'m so close.* The red sunset flashed through the front of his mind. Fleur's silver hair and blue eyes shone in the dappled light. Her small smile tied his heart in knots. *I won't lose. I can't.*

He flicked his wand into his palm and pressed its ebony tip against his wrist. \'Anything I\'ve forgotten?\'

\'No.\' Salazar smirked. \'Have fun.\'

Harry shot him a flat stare, then drew the tip of his wand across his wrist. A line of fire tore across his forearm. Rivulets of blood trickled down his skin and dripped to the floor. He pulled a ribbon of red from the wound with his wand and draped it across the pattern of purple flame.

*And now for the bit that hurts.* Harry blotted out the dull, ache in his wrist that throbbed to the beat of his heart. *But it's worth it. A perfect wish is worth any pain.*

The runes flared bright, searing at his eyes, and white sparks exploded from the triangles at his feet. Tiny pinpricks of heat welled up in his toes and fingertips, points of pain so small he wasn\'t

sure they hurt. The heat sank deep, as if needles had been driven into his fingers and toes.

*Merde.* He bit down on his lip and a hot, copper tang filled his mouth.

The sensation crept along his fingers, spreading over his body needle by needle, each one burning like bubotuber pus against his skin. The searing points of pain pierced his chest, his thighs, his face, and even his tongue, then a fluid heat washed through him and drained away like the tide. Harry opened his eyes.

\'You didn\'t collapse,\' Salazar said. \'How do you feel?\'

Harry watched the purple flames fade. \'Strange...' He opened and closed his hand. 'Everything's moving normally, but a part of me knows I can go faster.'

'Odd feeling, isn't it?' Salazar chuckled. 'Give it a test.'

Harry flicked his wand into his palm and cast a jinx in a seamless blur. His bright blue spell spattered against the effigy opposite him the moment the thought formed to move.

\'Oh my,\' Salazar murmured. \'That *was* fast.\'

Harry caught a gleam of pride in Salazar's eyes and

swallowed a small lump of emotion. 'Thanks.'

\'You should heal your arm,\' Salazar said.

Harry inspected the cut. The edges of the wound crept back together. He blinked and looked again. *Yeah, it's definitely healing by itself.*

'I'm healing already.'

\'Really?\' Salazar peered down at his arm, then at the runes.

'How *fascinating*. I can't see anything wrong with the runes...'

Harry glanced at them, then at the book. *The old ones.*

\'I think I might know why.' He pointed at a rune at the tip of a triangle. 'That means strength in your book, but means resilience in my new one, which I read first. I guess my intent was a bit off.\'

Salazar nodded. 'Be more careful, Harry. Time will tell if this is a boon or not. Next time you might not be so lucky.'

'I will see you five hours ago to take a nice nap.' Harry plucked the time-turner off the floor and flipped it round. It spun within its golden frame, over and over, then events blurred backwards past him and he closed his eyes with a small, tired smile.

# Man's Greatest Treasure

The sunset hovered beyond green fields and the swaying fronds of the willow tree. He stood on white pebbles and watched the light play across the heavens with a small smile.

The ground changed beneath his feet. White pebbles shifted to staring skulls below his heels. Harry struggled over them toward the sunset, but sank further in with each step until cold bone closed about his neck.

'You won't make it.' Fleur crouched on the roots of the tree. The azure silk of her dress stretched across her knees, her blue eyes unreadable behind a veil of silver hair, and a gleaming, sapphire- studded tiara perched upon her head. 'You don't just get to waltz off after your wishes, monCœur. There's a price to be paid. A pound of flesh.'

Harry struggled, but only sank further. 'I'm too heavy.' She stared down at him. 'A pound of flesh\...'

He slipped his wand from his sleeve and stared at the slim length of ebony, his stomach knotting and churning. 'A pound of flesh,' he whispered. 'Can't you pull me out?'

She shook her head, the red light flashing upon the silver tiara and its gemstones. 'I can't reach you.' Fleur looked back toward the sunset. 'We're missing it, monCœur.'

*I can't lose it.*

Harry steeled himself and brought his wand down like a blade. A bright green flash seared his eyes and his hand hung from his arm, half-severed. 'Sacrifices have to be made,' he muttered.

Harry cut again.

It dropped into the skulls and he rose a little higher.

'It's not enough,' Fleur murmured. 'Hurry, monCœur.'

Harry swallowed hard and raised his wand to his shoulder. The rest of his arm tumbled away and he clawed his way up until the skulls were only waist high.

'More,' she whispered. '*More*. We're losing the light.' Harry's stomach swirled like a storm, clenching into a thick,

hot, sick knot. 'Whatever it takes, mon Rêve.' He cast away his wand

and clawed the flesh from his ribs a fistful at a time, ripping bones free and tossing hot, red, organs away after them.

'Just a little more, monCœur,' Fleur murmured. 'We're almost there.'

He curled his fingers round his heart; it throbbed in his hand.

'Even this?' A fierce unease seized him. 'I think I might need this.'

She extended her hand. 'Hurry, Harry. The sunset's disappearing.'

He closed his eyes, tore it out and cast it away, hauling himself out of the skulls and stumbling up onto the bank. A sliver of red lingered over the curve of the horizon. Fleur sat upon the branch in a dress of midnight blue silk, swinging her legs as the light faded.

'I made it,' he said.

'Made it?' She twisted about and stared down at him with cold, pitch-black eyes; her fingers curled 'round the silver and sapphire circlet shining upon her brow. 'You didn't *makeit*. There's nothing of you left.'

Harry jolted awake and stared at the ceiling of the chamber. The golden hourglass swung back and forth over his sternum. *I don't think using the time-turner a lot is a good idea from now on. These dreams seem to come when I use it.* He grimaced and pulled the slim gold chain over his head. *Awful things happen to wizards who mess with time.*

He ran a finger along the thread-thin pink line on his forearm and rolled out of bed, transfiguring it back into a stone serpent. *It'll be gone by tomorrow at this rate.* Harry rummaged through his pockets for a scrap of parchment. His fingers met warm, smooth metal.

'The circlet...' Harry pulled it out and balanced it on its palm.

Silver gleamed as bright as moonlight, the sapphires shone like sunlight off the soft waves of a summer sea. He ran a fingertip along the gentle curve; smiling as it grew warmer and released a quiet chitter.

*Such a strange thing.*

It drew his touch like a sore tooth drew the tip of his tongue.

Thick, sticky pine-sap smeared one sapphire and he wrinkled his

nose, heading up toward Myrtle's Bathroom.

Harry weighed it in his hand, then slid it back into his pocket.

*A shame it's too girly to wear.* He ran his fingers along it. *Maybe I should give it to Fleur once it's clean. She doesn't wear much jewellery, though.*

The circlet twittered in his pocket and the metal flared warm under his fingertips.

'You like that, huh,' Harry murmured. 'Of course, she might take you apart to see how you work, which would be a shame.'

He strode into the girl\'s bathroom and swept the water- covered floor clean with his wand, grabbing a few damp paper towels and scrubbing the pine sap off the sapphires. The entrance to the chamber slid shut as he stuffed the paper towels in the bin and polished the circlet clean on his robes.

'Open,\' he whispered.

The diadem chittered and turned hot in his pocket.

'Yeah, I can make odd noises, too.' He stroked the edge of his thumb across the sapphire. 'Only people would think that you're cute and that I'm some kind of budding mass-murderer, which isn't exactly fair.'

*Although, I have killed a few people now...* He paused on the last step and spun the circlet in his fingers. *But they were pretty awful people and it wasn't like I had much choice.*

Harry drifted into the study, bouncing the tiara on his palms. \'Where did you find *that!?*\' Salazar hissed. \'It was *lost!*\'

'Lost?' Harry stroked the shining, silver curve. 'Well it's found now. I think I quite like it.'

'It's Rowena's diadem!' Salazar ripped the serpent from around his neck and tossed it away into the background of his painting. His wand sprayed silver sparks to the edges of his frame.

'Her foolish daughter stole it and fled. A young man went out to

rescue her, but neither returned.\'

\'I found it in the Room of Requirement,' Harry said. 'Not sure how it ended up there. Umbridge pinched it and I nearly left it in the Forbidden Forest, but it's kind of beautiful.'

Salazar stared at the silver diadem. 'Rowena and Godric made that. Rowena loved it. She used to put it on little Helena when she was just a child and watch her totter around with it on her head.' He sighed. 'Helena always loved that diadem, but Rowena was better with magic than motherhood.'

*And so she took it and ran away.* Harry grimaced; it was Privet drive that flickered through his thoughts, Petunia's cold indifference. *And I bet she never came back.*

\'How does it work?\' he asked.

\'You wear it,\' Salazar muttered. \'It\'s a tiara, what were you expecting?\'

\'I thought it might have a phrase to activate it.'

\'Keep it,\' Salazar said. \'Like all the best pieces of Godric and Rowena's work, it's *art*. They based it on the sorting hat Godric made, only Rowena made sure it's less... *eccentric.*'

\'I\'m going to use it.' Harry stared into the shining sapphire. 'I want to use it.'

*It must be amazing.* He placed it on his head. Warmth seeped into his scalp and a soft chitter drifted to his ear.

\'Wit beyond measure is man\'s greatest treasure*,\'* a soft, smooth, high, male voice murmured. \'Such a neat little saying, but we know it isn\'t true, don\'t we, Harry?'

Red eyes gleamed in the back of Harry's mind.

\'We know there's only power,\' Voldemort hissed.

Harry tore the tiara from his head and kicked it away. It skittered across the floor, screeching and screaming like metal nails down glass.

\'What are you *doing?!*\' Salazar snapped. 'That's *Rowena's*

*diadem!*'

\'It has Voldemort's voice. It whispers back.' Harry

swallowed and slid his wand from his sleeve. 'Like the diary *wrote*

back.'

'A horcrux,' Salazar breathed. 'Tom made a horcrux of Rowena's Diadem...' Black fury burnt in his green eyes. 'I told him how precious it was to her and he *defiled* it.'

'I can't rip the soul fragment out.' Harry met Salazar's glare. 'It can't be done.'

\'Destroy it,\' he spat.

Harry conjured a long, thin piece of metal and flicked the tiara out onto the bridge with it. *I'm not here to be used. Not by Dumbledore. Not by Voldemort. Not by anyone.* He buried the diadem in a stream of red Fiendfyre as thick as his arm and forced the heat higher until the circlet screamed.

'Is it destroyed?' Salazar asked.

Harry dispelled the flames and nudged the blackened, cracked circlet with his toe. A thick, ink-black wisp of smoke belched forth from the cracks and dissipated with a faint whisper. \'It\'s destroyed.'

\'Good,\' Salazar snapped. 'That diadem was as precious to Rowena as my locket was to me, it would've torn her heart to see it used so. Few things we deem precious survive,\' he murmured. \'That\'s why blood is important, little else of you lasts long after your death but your bloodline.\'

\'I don\'t know of any others who claim to be descended from your friends,\' Harry said.

\'I feared it would be so even before we died,\' Salazar said. \'Godric was too set on saving other people to ever do something so selfish as follow his own heart, Rowena had only one daughter, and it seems my only two descendants are trying their best to kill each other. Soon there will be nothing left of us but a divided school, Godric\'s scruffy hat, that ridiculous sword, and two forgotten, empty rooms.\'

\'What about Helga?\' Harry asked.

\'She had family,\' Salazar said. \'A big one, once, but if you don't know of them, I suspect they no longer exist. Perhaps some of her work survives, the plants she created, the potions, spells, or even that useless cup.\' He chuckled. \'She convinced Rowena to spend hours helping her enchant a cup to absorb the properties of her phoenix\'s tears, only to forget that phoenix tears don\'t actually do anything if you drink them. Only Helga could have made such a mistake.\' Salazar chortled and his serpent bobbed its head. \'Or Godric, but he would have chosen the perfect substance, then accidentally enchanted the cup to spew it out the bottom onto your lap when you tried to drink from it.\'

made?\'

Harry smiled. \'What mistakes would you and Rowena have

\'Rowena would have lost the thing.\' Salazar snorted, then

the humour faded from his face. \'I, well, if it was really important to me, I would've probably ended up sacrificing it for something I couldn't manage to do in the end.\'

'But you could've done it if you'd had more time.'

'Maybe.' Salazar pointed his wand at Harry. 'Don't repeat my mistakes. Some things are out of reach.'

'I just want Fleur,' Harry whispered. 'That's all. I can endure

without anything else. I have before. But not her. I need her.'

Salazar blinked and a faint shimmer rippled across his

canvas. 'I know, Tom.'

Harry snorted. 'You *are* going senile. I'm *Harry.* Tom was the

other one.'

Salazar blinked, a deep frown creasing brow as he retrieved his snake. \'You should go, Harry. You came here to go get the Prophecy, not to listen to me reminisce about our flaws, many though they were.\'

\'They make you seem human,\' Harry murmured. \'Without them you'd be just as distant and unreachable as the other names that've outlived the faces they were once associated with.\'

\'That sounded wise, like something I would say,\' Salazar

said.

retorted.

\'Wisdom can be found in the strangest of places,\' Harry

\'That *definitely* sounds like me. Now go, go and find out what\'s so important about this prophecy that both Dumbledore and Voldemort will sacrifice lives for it.\'

\'I will.\' Harry kicked the marred circlet into the pool and watched it sink into the dark water.

*It will remain lost.* He disillusioned himself and pictured the fireplace in Borgin and Burke\'s. *The floo network here will do. I doubt they'll run to the aurors to complain about a break in knowing who their customers are.*

He appeared before the fire with a soft snap, then took a pinch of powder from the open top of a human skull. \'Number Twelve Grimmauld Place,\' he whispered, tossing the powder into the fire.

The flames flared green. He stepped in, inhaled a lungful of smoke, and collapsed onto a cold, hard, stone floor.

'I hate floo travel.' He dragged himself to his feet and dusted off his robes.

Tattered wallpaper, rotting plaster, and crumbling mortar hung from bare, rough stone. Grime caked the corners and crannies. A leaning tower of soup tins and a collection of dirty mugs occupied the sink. He drifted out of the kitchen and into a narrow hall.

Scratched, scraped, and rotting hardwood floorboards creaked beneath his feet and the thick must of mildew reached his nose.

'Lovely place, this.' Harry glanced about. 'Who'd want to live here?'

Thick, velvet curtains flew open on his left. Harry flicked his wand into his hand and twisted 'round. A detailed, life-size painting stared at him. She had the same chin, nose, eyes, and ears as Sirius.

\'You\'re not my blood-traitor son.\' Her face twisted out of its expression of ugly disdain into something that would've been beautiful, had age not marred it.

*I should incinerate you.* Harry spun his wand in his hand.

*You've seen me. But it might be hard to explain that you're missing.*

\'You look like you come from a good family.\' The woman sniffed. \'Good bone-structure and nice-eyes. What\'s a proper pure- blood doing among the half-breeds and traitors my son consorts with?\'

*Maybe I don't have to burn you, then.* He slipped his wand back into his sleeve. *It doesn't seem like you're keen to talk to Dumbledore's lot.*

\'I\'m Harry. I\'m afraid I don\'t have the pleasure of knowing your name?\'

\'Walburga Black.\' She smiled and her face shed several decades. \'Do you have a family name?\'

*Sirius's mother. So not a Dumbledore supporter. Quite the*

*opposite.*

\'Slytherin,\' he said.

\'An honour.\' Walburga Black dipped her head. \'I assume you aren\'t here to join my son\'s little group of muggle-lovers.\'

\'No,\' Harry said. \'I have very different aims.\'

\'Do you follow the Dark Lord?\' Walburga Black enquired. \'My Regulus followed him, he was a proper pure-blood scion.\'

\'No. The Dark Lord has been unmasked. His real name is Tom Riddle, a muggle-raised, half-blooded wizard who doesn\'t even believe in blood purity.\'

\'He lied,\' Walburga Black whispered. \'But my Regulus *died*

for him.\'

\'So did many others,\' Harry said. \'So will many more.\' Walburga Black stared down into the bottom of her frame.

'Then why *are* you here? You didn\'t come to rip apart the last shreds of a long-dead woman\'s world.'

'I came to meet with Sirius.'

\'So you *are* one of the blood-traitors.\' She sniffed. 'Your noble ancestor would be ashamed.'

'No he wouldn't.' Harry let his tone harden. 'Neither he nor I not care about blood purity. There's only power, and the intent with which it's wielded.'

\'All powerful wizards are pure-bloods,\' Walburga Black replied. 'Just look at my family. My sons, even the *disappointment,* are powerful wizards, Cissy, Bella, and the *other one* are all powerful witches, even her half-blood girl is.'

\'Tell that to your Dark Lord. He\'s just a half-blood, too, remember.\'

\'I serve no half-blooded imposter,\' she hissed. \'That liar stole my Regulus from me and brought half a hundred old families and bloodlines to an end. He is *no* lord of mine.\'

\'He's a distant relative, as I\'m sure you\'ve realised.\' Harry swallowed a sour taste. 'But he's no friend of mine.'

'And what about you? You never actually said. I assumed you\'re pure-blooded if you truly carry the Slytherin name, but I made the same mistake with the Dark Lord.'

\'I\'m not sure,\' Harry said. \'I don\'t know the exact boundaries, but I don\'t particularly care, either. I\'m stronger than most my age or older, pure-blooded or not.\'

\'Very likely a pure-blood by my estimation.\' Walburga folded her arms. \'You have the feel of a pure-blood and the looks of one, too. I can\'t imagine you\'d be anything else. Not if you're using that name.\'

\'I don\'t use that name except in particular company,\' Harry

replied.

\'Understandable.\' Walburga scowled. 'There're many

muggle-lovers who'd like nothing more than to condemn us for being more than they are. We are not born equal, magic is in the blood, and our blood is the oldest and purest of them all.\'

\'You're not going to convince me to adopt the pure-blood agenda. I judge each individual on their own merit and make fewer mistakes because of it.\'

\'A pity.\' She sniffed. \'I'd hoped you might knock some sense into my son before he completely ruins this family by selling us out to blood-traitors.\'

\'If your family comes to ruin it will be the work of Voldemort and Dumbledore,\' Harry muttered.

\'It will be the work of *my eldest son*,\' she hissed. \'He is the *last* scion of the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black, he needs to find himself a suitable wife and an heir. Regulus would be married by now.\'

\'If only he wasn\'t dead,\' Harry muttered. 'Where *is* Sirius?'

\'I don\'t suppose you know any eligible girls from good families?\' Walburga asked.

\'Not off the top of my head.\' Harry laughed. 'I don't think Sirius will be keen, though.'

\'Kreacher,\' Walburga shrieked.

Harry flinched. A loud crack echoed through the hall and a hunched, withered house elf appeared next to Harry. Kreacher stared up at him with narrowed, washed-out, pale blue eyes.

\'Mistress called Kreacher.' Kreacher bowed so low before

the painting his nose brushed the floor.

\'This is... Harry,\' Walburga folded her arms. \'He is from a *very* respectable family, you will treat him as he deserves, not like the other blood traitors my shameful son has brought into my home. Find the family records, search for any other possible male heirs of the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black, my son cannot be trusted to take his duties to the family seriously. He never has had any love for us.\'

Kreacher grinned. \'Yes mistress.'

'Until next time.' The curtains swept closed.

Kreacher peered at Harry and wrung his hands. \'From a respectable family Mistress says, but Kreacher knows only nasty traitor Master\'s friends can come to Mistress\'s house. Blood traitors, filthy creatures, and mud-bloods all of them. But Mistress gave Kreacher orders and Kreacher will follow them.\'

\'Shut up, Kreacher, you\'ve got a decade of cleaning to catch up with.\' Sirius appeared at the other end of the hall. \'He\'s a miserable little house elf, malicious as the day I left this place and a whole lot less sane than I remember.\'

\'Yes, Master.' Kreacher shuffled away. \'Nasty blood-traitor master, abandoning Mistress Black and Master Regulus,\' he muttered.

Sirius shot a hot glare after the elf skulking up the stairs. \'I hate that elf. I hated him before I left this awful, miserable, blood- stained place, and I hate him even more now mother's portrait has driven him mad.'

\'I spoke with your mother.' Harry grinned. 'She seemed nice.' \'I didn\'t hear any screeching?'

\'She seemed convinced I was a pure-blood and tried to ask me about eligible girls for you to marry and produce a male heir with.\'

Sirius's face contorted. 'Oh *now* she wants me to consort with witches. If she\'d had her way, I would've been married to my cousin, Bella.' He shuddered. 'That's why I ran away, you know.

Bella's not been right since she had an accident as a little girl. Mother wanted me to marry and look after her, keep everything neatly in the family, and in return, Regulus would've been heir and done all the things I hated, but I would've rather slept on the streets than get dragged into that.'

'So you left?'

Sirius grimaced. 'Sounds bad, doesn't it.' He sighed. 'I ran away from here. I ran away from James. I ran away from Azkaban. Now, I'm stuck here, back where I started, and I can't even run away this time.'

Harry stared at him. \'I told your mother's picture Voldemort's a half-blood. She seemed quite upset about that.\'

\'She would be. She sent Regulus off to die for him.\' Sirius\'s frown darkened. \'After Bella's accident, they never let up on us for a second. Andi left the family the first moment she could. Cissy... She just gave in. I left. Regulus had a kind heart, he never had a chance.\'

\'So have you really been stuck in here all this time on your own?\' Harry asked.

\'This isn\'t even the worst bit.\' Sirius chuckled. \'Follow me, we haven\'t cleaned the top floor yet, I\'ll show you what the whole place was like when I came back.\'

Harry drifted up the stairs after him.

Sirius picked his way round a few dubious, dark stains. \'I\'m not always on my own, though. During the school holidays, some of the Order members come to stay here. This is the headquarters, after all, my father had the whole place warded as extensively as possible and after Dumbledore cast the Fidelius Charm, it became all but impossible for anyone to come here without invitation. Still, you've no *idea* how much I\'ve been looking forward to getting out of here.\'

The scoured walls and floors gave way to rot, mildew, damp, mould, and dark, stained, smeared, dust-coated wall- hangings.

\'Beautiful, isn\'t it?\' Sirius quipped.

\'The whole place was like this?\' Harry swallowed a flare of anger. 'And Dumbledore just left you here?'

\'Until this summer,\' Sirius replied. \'I didn\'t really notice after Azkaban and living on the run, but Molly wasn\'t having any of it and

started everyone on cleaning the moment she arrived. Ron, Hermione, and the other Weasleys helped a bit at Christmas, but the top floor has the library, my father\'s study, and the attic. Nobody wants to use any of them, so I\'ve had Kreacher start cleaning them.\'

\'He doesn\'t seem to have got very far.'

\'I know.\' Sirius shrugged. \'I was hoping there would be doxies, another boggart, or something that would finish him off, but sadly, the horrible wretch lingers on to irritate me.\'

A loud rattle came from the room at the end of the corridor. \'That\'s probably him now,\' Sirius muttered. \'He\'s likely trying

to *save* everything he can find that belonged to my family before

doing any actual cleaning. I\'d better go and stop him before he manages to hide anything away again. He had a whole stash of treasures, you know. It took Hermione and Ron a whole day to get rid of his little hoard.\'

Sirius pushed the door open, the metal lock tearing straight through the rotted wooden frame.

Harry\'s parents stood on the other side of the desk, their arms folded across their chests, their faces twisted in anger. They leant away from each other as if they were joined at the hip.

\'You failed us,\' James hissed. \'You left our Harry and threw yourself in prison. Now you hide in here. You should be out fighting! We fought, Remus is fighting, even Peter fought for *someone*. You\'re a *coward* Black, a pitiful, terrified coward. You sicken us.\'

*A boggart.* Harry pulled out his wand.

His mother's hair darkened, slipping across her face to cover

it as his father melted away into her side and they shrunk into the

skeletal, cloaked form of a dementor. A cold, creeping chill slid across the room. The dementor tugged back its hood a fraction to bare grey, withered lips and a gaping orifice.

Sirius moaned and yanked at his hair. \'I escaped,\' he whispered. \'I\'m free, they\'re gone, they\'re gone, they\'re *gone*. I\'m not a coward,\' he yelled, swinging his fist at the dementor.

Harry pushed him out of the way. He struck the bookshelf and collapsed to the floor, curling up into a shivering ball.

The dementor twisted about and melted into a slim shadow. 'Au revoir,' it whispered in Fleur's voice, a ring of burning gold shining upon her left hand. 'Au revoir, Harry. I'm afraid perfect wishes just don't come true.'

Harry's heart sank down into the dark. *No.* He clawed it back and clutched for the cold rage; it came with fragmented images. Fleur arm in arm with a shadow, embracing, entwined, ecstatic, its dark hands where only Harry's had been. *How dare it. How dare it show me that.*

Fiendfyre gushed from his wand tip. Crimson flames swallowed the boggart and the desk. Harry watched it writhe and burn, still shifting. Red eyes gleamed through the bright flames, Fleur's silver hair smouldered and sprang into flame. He stared until it fell still and crumbled to ash, then extinguished the Fiendfyre.

*Nothing will send me back to how I was. I won't lose her.*

*She promised.*

'Is it gone?' Sirius croaked.

'Yes. It showed me something I didn't want to see and is probably very much regretting it.' Harry slid his wand back up his sleeve. 'Are you ok?'

'I don't like dementors.' Sirius uncurled from the floor and opened his eyes. 'Or boggarts.'

'Me neither.' Harry kicked the ashes away. 'Let's go, Sirius.

We need to get that prophecy.'

# The Price of Prophesy

Flat paving stones stretched up and down the street, spotted with chewing gum and stalked by scabrous, feral pigeons. A lopsided red phone box stood on the pavement behind a row of chipped, marked bollards.

\'Cloak?\' Harry pulled it out from under his robes.

\'Just like old times.\' Sirius grinned and swept it over the two of them. \'Except this time we\'re stealing a very valuable magical object for Britain, not McGonagall\'s fire-whiskey for a party.' He chuckled. 'This is probably safer. Your mother was a cruelly strict prefect.\'

Harry snorted. 'So, where's the entrance?'

\'Expecting a giant building saying *The Ministry of Magic*?\' \'No,\' Harry said. \'But more than *this*.\'

\'It\'s grander on the inside. They don\'t want the muggles getting curious.\'

He stepped towards the phone box, opened the door and gestured for Harry to join him inside. The peeling, red-painted booth stank of weed and worse.

\'This is the informal visitors\' entrance,\' Sirius said. \'Normally everyone just floos in, but obviously we can\'t do that without getting caught. The Ministry does monitor the network fairly efficiently.\' He turned to the phone and poked a hand out from under the cloak to quickly dial a number. \'Emmeline will be on her way out by now, so we\'re within our window of opportunity.\'

\'Welcome to the Ministry of Magic,\' a female voice stated. \'Please state your name and business.\'

\'Sirius Black. And I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.\' Harry stared at him.

\'It\'s probably not a real person, the voice is still the same as it was before my stint in Azkaban.\'

A soft click came from the phone and a badge slid out of the phone's change dispenser. Sirius picked it up and pinned it to the front of his robes with a huge grin on his face.

*Sirius Black*. *Up to no good.* Harry laughed. *Excellent.*

\'I always wanted a badge like this. This is the best thing the Ministry has ever given me.\' He shrugged. \'It\'s the only thing they\'ve given me, actually, it\'s not like I received a trial.\'

The phone box lurched. Harry watched the pavement slide up past the window.

*I wonder how many times a muggle has dialled the number and ended up down here.*

An empty, marble-paved floor greeted them. Golden runes twisted around one another, flowing in ever-changing patterns across the royal blue ceiling.

\'This way.' Sirius took Harry\'s elbow and led him along the hall of empty fireplaces past the empty security desk. \'We\'re lucky, whoever\'s on duty must have snuck off somewhere, or Mundungus might've bribed him to be absent for a convenient moment so he can get in and out unobserved.\'

They hurried past the desk and the cheerful statues in a fountain who spouted water from the strangest places, then through the golden gates of the Ministry's true entrance.

\'In here.' Sirius tugged him across to the lift and tapped the down button until the doors opened. '*Finally*.' He stepped in and prodded the number nine button several times, then the doors clanked shut.

\'Floor thirteen,\' the same female voice announced.

\'It\'s on the lowest level,\' Sirius said. \'We\'re inside the wards now, so the only way out without breaking them is by floo, which is monitored, or back the way we came. Breaking those wards is no mean feat.\'

\'So don\'t get caught or we\'ll be trapped,\' Harry murmured. \'Exactly. We can dispense with the cloak, though.

Mundungus will be the only one down here.\'

Harry folded the cloak back up and stuffed it into his robes as the lift ground to a halt.

'Floor thirteen,\' the voice said.

\'It\'s just around the corner,' Sirius said. 'Voldemort's not supposed to be up to anything for a bit, so we should be in the clear there, too.'

'How do you know that?'

\'Snape.' Sirius scowled. \'He\'s Dumbledore\'s spy within the Death Eaters. Not much gets past him, apparently. He\'s always been a sneaky, clever sort, but I think he can be trusted...\'

The plain, black door at the end of the corridor had been melted back to the hinges by fire fierce enough to scar the floor and ceiling above.

*Fiendfyre...*

\'Not much gets past him...\' Harry flicked his wand into his palm. 'We have company.'

\'Apparently he\'s not as sneaky and clever as I hoped. I\'m calling for the rest of the Order.\' Sirius reached inside his robes and pulled out a battered, bronze phoenix amulet. 'Voldemort *can't* get hold of that prophecy, Harry. We can deal with Dumbledore afterward.'

Harry advanced down the corridor a bit, stepping over a dark, crimson smear and the broken halves of a wand. 'How long will it be?'

\'They\'ll be coming as soon as they can.\' Sirius peered into

the dark beyond the door. 'A few minutes, most likely.'

\'We should keep going,\' Harry said. \'If they\'re already inside, then someone has to stop them.\'

*And I need to hear that prophecy.*

Sirius drew his wand and nodded. He pressed the back of his hand to the frame of the door, hissed and flinched away. 'Still hot. They can't be more than a few minutes ahead of us.'

\'Let\'s go.\' Harry slipped past Sirius into the department.

The corridor continued on beyond the ruined door, a long hallway tiled and paved in gleaming, black slabs that reflected the

light of the torches like glass. Harry followed the lights, his footsteps echoing in the cramped space.

Sirius swore and yanked him to a halt. \'It\'s a circle. A loop. It just seems like a straight line. We\'ve been walking around the same ten feet of corridor.\' His godfather swept his wand at the nearest torch.

The white flames guttered out all along the corridor, plunging them into the dark.

Sirius ran his fingers along the wall. 'Let\'s try this door.' A perfect circle of benches ringed a tall, gleaming mirror. *The Mirror of Erised.*

\'This isn\'t it,\' Harry said. 'Let's go.'

Sirius pressed his fingertips against the glass of the mirror. 'We\'re all together again. I can see us all together: Remus, James, Lily, me, even Peter.\' He pressed his forehead against the mirror\'s surface. \'He\'s not a Death Eater! He never betrayed us.\'

\'Sirius.\' Harry dragged his godfather back from the mirror.

\'It\'s a *lie*.\'

*there*.\'

\'A lie,\' his godfather murmured, \'but I can *see* them, they\'re

\'No. You just *want* to see them.\'

\'Oh.\' The lines in Sirius\'s face sunk deep and the shadow of

Azkaban spread over his features. \'I thought, I hoped, it might be real.\' \'It isn\'t.\' Harry glanced into the mirror.

His reflection smiled back, one arm around Fleur's waist; she had a small, warm, smile on her face and the sun set behind them in a wash of orange and red.

*Perfect.* He took a step closer.

A silver-haired girl leapt across to take Fleur\'s hand, clutching at her arm.

*Gabby?*

Gabby turned to glance up at him and bright emerald eyes gleamed beneath her silver hair. The bottom dropped out of Harry's stomach and his heart lurched.

*Not Gabby*. *A daughter. Our daughter.* Warmth rushed through him and hot tears welled up. He raised a hand to pull the little girl out through the glass and into reality, then sighed and let his arm drop. *It's not real. Not yet.*

\'It only shows you what you want most.\' Harry tore his gaze away from the girl\'s vivid green eyes and the little smile she'd inherited from her mother. 'Leave it.'

He strode out into the darkness and trailed his fingertips along the wall of the corridor, bumping over each line in between the tiles until he touched something warmer.

\'Sirius,\' Harry murmured. \'I found another door.\' His godfather nodded.

Harry pushed it open. Worn, weathered, ancient stone benches enclosed a simple, single arch of stone upon a raised dais in concentric circles. The gap between the two pillars rippled and shimmered like heat haze.

\'What is it?\' Sirius whispered.

\'I\'m not sure.'

He drifted past the benches and ran his hand down the left pillar. His fingertips dragged over thousands of tiny runes that stretched back and forth across the stone in a dizzying swirl of patterns. The veil shifted and a soft, low whisper rose from the far side as if a crowd of hundreds murmured beyond it.

*This is more complex magic than even the wards on the*

*chamber...*

Grindelwald's sigil marked the summit of the arch, etched into the stone just as it'd been into the worn, weathered, faded graves at Godric's Hollow. He traced a fingertip over the cold stone, tracing the faint scratches of countless runes.

\'Harry,\' Sirius hissed. \'We need to keep going.\'

Harry snatched his fingers back and stepped away from the

whispering arch. 'It was just a few seconds.'

\'You were standing there for ages.\'

Harry blinked. \'It only felt like moments,\' he muttered. \'I hope the next door is the one we need, this place is far more dangerous than I expected.\'

\'There've been no proper Unspeakables since Grindelwald killed them all years ago, but the most abstract, dangerous, and mysterious aspects of magic are studied here,\' Sirius muttered. 'Shouldn't've ever expected to be able to waltz through to the prophecy.\'

'Where's the rest of the Order?\'

\'Coming,\' Sirius said. \'Don\'t worry about the prophecy, Dumbledore told us that only you can remove it from the shelf.'

They edged along the corridor in the gloom. Their steps echoed through the dark like stones tossed down a well.

\'I\'ve found another door,\' Sirius whispered. \'Let\'s hope this is the right one,\' Harry said.

Towering shelves of glowing, swirling white orbs stretched into the distance. Blue flames burnt at every junction, bathing the cathedral of prophecies in ethereal light. A small, dark plaque hung on the wall by the door.

*The Hall of Prophecies.*

\'How do we find the right one?\' he asked. 'There're thousands.'

Sirius inspected the nearest shelf. \'They\'re labelled. These are all this year. We need to go further in. The prophecy had to have been made at least sixteen years ago, that was when Dumbledore said Lily and James needed to go into hiding. We\'ll start there.\' He strode off down through the shelves, keeping an eye on the labels.

Harry slipped his wand out of his sleeve and trailed after him. Endless rows of white orbs passed by.

Sirius paused before a shelf and scanned it. \'Here. It was made to Dumbledore, he\'s the only one with so many initials, and it\'s about you and Voldemort. Grab it. I can't. You can only take it if it's about you.\'

A fist of ice clamped 'round Harry's heart. \'Me and

Voldemort. Nobody else?\'

\'Just the two of you.\'

\'If it\'s about Voldemort and I, then he wouldn\'t have sent

Death Eaters to retrieve it. He would've sent them to *clear the way*.\' \'Shit,\' Sirius muttered.

\'Let\'s get out of here.\' Harry plucked the small, glowing orb off the shelf and tucked it into his pocket.

They hurried back through the shelves toward the door, then stepped out into the black of the corridor. Brisk footsteps and the click of metal on stone drifted through the gloom.

\'Where *is* this room, Lucius?\' A soft giggle echoed through

the dark. 'I can't see *anything*.'

Sirius froze. Harry dragged him back several steps and pulled him through the nearest door. Hundreds of time-turners hung on the walls and upon an old, blackened table at the room's centre, a bird within a bell jar was born over and over again.

*Time-turners.* Temptation stabbed at him, then faded.

*They'll all be warded. I won't be able to take one.*

\'The next door.\' Lucius Malfoy\'s smooth voice slipped through the shadows. \'If you hadn\'t spent ages messing with the Veil and trying to get through the sealed door at the far end, we'd be done by now.\'

'Shush.\' The witch clapped her hands together. \'We\'re not

alone.\'

\'My Lord?\' Lucius called.

Harry shook Sirius back to life. \'They\'re between us and the

exit,\' he whispered. \'There\'s no room to sneak past under the cloak.\'

\'Perhaps the Order has another guard within the Department of Mysteries,\' Lucius Malfoy suggested. \'One that prefers to hide rather than do his duty.\'

\'A wise one.\' The witch giggled. \'HomenumRevelio. Ahead on the left, two of them.\'

\'We\'ll have to fight.\' Sirius looked like he might be sick. \'I\'ll go out first.\'

He drew his wand and stepped out into the corridor. White flames sprang up in the torches.

Harry glanced around, hoping for another door. *Nothing.* He eyed the time-turners. *I can\'t leave a whole room of time-turners here, warded or not*. *Voldemort would be unstoppable.*

Fiendfyre swirled from the tip of his wand, coalescing into a smouldering, white-hot basilisk. Harry sent it coiling around the room. The shelves, racks, and tiny, golden hourglasses melted, trickling down the walls. The room shook and shivered, and dust floated down from the ceiling.

*Merde.* Harry extinguished his fiendfyre. *The whole*

*building's enchanted. No more Fiendfyre, then.*

'Sirius!' Cheerful giggling echoed down the corridor. \'It\'s a reunion! Let's play a game!\'

Harry stepped out into the corridor.

\'Potter.\' Lucius Malfoy's voice came from behind the intricate lines carved on a skull-shaped, silver mask. \'The Dark Lord will be pleased when we bring him you.\'

\'He\'s here for the prophecy.' The witch cocked her head, sending dark curls tumbling over her purple dress. Her violet irises shone like rings of flame. 'Have you hidden it? Is it like hide and seek?'

\'You\'ll never hear it, Bella,\' Sirius spat. \'It\'s too late.\'

*So that\'s Bellatrix Lestrange, the witch who tortured Neville\'s parents into insanity.* Harry studied the pale skin of her cheekbones, nose, and jaw. *She looks just like Narcissa Malfoy, only with dark hair, purple eyes, and fuller lips.*

\'Give it to us,\' Lucius Malfoy snapped. \'It belongs to the Dark

Lord.\'

\'It belongs to *me*.' Harry raised his wand. 'If he wanted it, he

should've been faster.'

Bellatrix laughed. 'It's one thing to win the round, but *another* to win the game!' Her wand sprang into her hand and bright, yellow curses smashed into the tiles above Harry's head.

\'Protego,\' he murmured, shielding himself and Sirius from the next barrage of curses. \'We need to get back to the lift and the atrium.'

\'We\'ll have to get 'round them somehow,\' Sirius said. \'Stick together, we stand a better chance if we fight them at the same time than if we\'re separated. Bella\'s not all that good at playing as part of a team.\'

them.

\'Crucio,\' Lestrange cried.

A red beam of light splashed against the tiles between

\'Papilionis.\' Harry surrounded them with a sphere of butterflies.

\'Oooh, pretty!\' Bellatrix's laughter drifted through the

swirling cloud of dark wings. \'Avada kedavra!'

A single butterfly burst into black smoke.

\'Clever little Potter,\' she sang. 'Come play with Bella for a

bit!\'

Lucius Malfoy sighed. 'Bellatrix...'

Harry flicked his wand, transfiguring one of the butterflies

into a sharp steel spike and sending it hissing towards Malfoy. He tore the black tiles from the walls with a flick of his wand and drew them into a dense shield. Harry transfigured the rest and sent them after the first. Steel spikes smashed into the tiles, spraying shards down the corridor.

Sirius hurled bright orange curses at Bellatrix. She deflected them into the walls, giggling and twirling down the corridor.

\'Reducto,\' Harry murmured, whipping his wand through the motion for the blasting curse, then blending it into the action for the bone-splintering curse, flicking his wrist so fast his fingers blurred.

The tiles disintegrated. Malfoy dived across the corridor behind Bellatrix and his walking cane exploded into splinters, the silver handle skittering away down the floor.

Sirius laughed. 'You okay down there, Lucy?'

Bellatrix giggled and unleashed a barrage of bright- coloured spells. They ricocheted off each other, hammering into the tiles and the ceiling, sending dust swirling down the corridor. Harry

deflected the few he recognised and twisted away from the rest. The shattered tile fragments sprang to life between them, shifting into a swarm of scorpions. They scuttled down the corridor toward them as Malfoy swept his wand forward.

\'Incendio,\' Sirius spat.

The scorpions vanished beneath a gout of orange flame, burning with a series of cracks and pops. Harry stepped 'round Sirius and threw as many spells as he could at Bellatrix. She laughed and returned fire. His spells buried hers. Flashes of bright pink, yellow, and orange burst amidst his hail of white and purple curses. Bellatrix huffed, swatting his spells back at him.

The first hissed past his ear, scorching deep marks into the floor, and a flash of maroon whispered past his ribs. Harry deflected them away and ducked the spells Bellatrix slipped into the mix.

\'Switch!' Sirius transfigured the tiles behind Bellatrix into ropes. 'Time out, cousin!'

The ropes seized Bellatrix's limbs, wrapping around her like snakes. A faint shimmer of magic rippled over her and they burnt away into wisps of dark smoke.

\'Expulso,\' Harry hissed.

The explosion tore the floor open beneath Bellatrix and Malfoy, tossing them down the corridor. Harry grabbed Sirius's arm and dragged him past the sprawled pair, twisting to rain bone- splintering curses over his shoulder as they ran towards the lift.

Malfoy snatched his wand up from the floor and ripped every tile off the wall, sending a hail of them flying across the corridor. They hammered into Harry's ribs and white-hot pain burst

across his chest. He hauled Sirius through the first doorway and leapt behind the stone benches.

\'Lacero,\' he whispered, sending purple curses tearing through the wall.

A hiss of pain came from the other side and a dishevelled Bellatrix stumbled through the door, one hand pressed to the gash on her thigh. 'You ruined my dress!' She let out a little shriek and a faint shimmer of magic washed off her like heat haze. 'It was a *present!'*

Malfoy ducked in through the hole in the wall. Dust coated his long blond hair and robes.

\'AvadaKedavra,\' Bellatrixcried.

A flash of green vanished into the archway behind Harry. He transfigured the bench nearest them into a stone serpent and sent it lunging toward Bellatrix and Malfoy.

\''*Booooooring!* Confringo!\' Bellatrix shattered the stone serpent with a wave of her wand.

Stone fragments sprayed across the room. Harry banished them away from himself and Malfoy doubled over with a low grunt. His hand came away crimson.

\'You never could play well with others,\' Sirius taunted. 'No

wonder Andi left and never looked back.'

Bella's eyes lit up with purple flame. 'Silly cousin Sirius. I'm going to win our little game, then the Dark Lord will purge all the stupid, useless cattle from our world. The only people *left* will be the ones that can play with me!\'

Sirius swept his wand 'round in a wide arc. \'Ardens flagella.'

A dark, shimmering line of purple fire melted through the ceiling, tiles, and benches like boiling water through snow. Bellatrix ducked and did a little pirouette around the violet fire. The flames seared across Malfoy's left side, melting his flesh like wax, and the reek of burnt meat filled Harry's nostrils. Malfoy screamed, dropping his wand and clutching his face, and Sirius\'s spell caught Malfoy in the chest, knocking him back into the ruined wall.

\'Such pretty magic.\' Bellatrix giggled, dodging Harry\'s blasting curses and deflecting Sirius\'s second stunner away. \'I know that spell too! Ardens flagella!\'

Bright, vivid pink flames burst from the tip of her wand. Harry hurled himself sideways and Sirius flinched from the heat of the fire as it splashed off the arch like water, covering his face with his arm. The veil shimmered in the corner of his eye and soft whispers rose up like smoke.

\'Expelliarmus,' Bella cried.

Harry's wand slipped from his fingers. He dived left and rolled to his feet, thrusting out his hand and summoning his wand. It slapped back into his palm.

\'Crucio.' Bella danced onto the benches and thrust her wand

out.

Harry tensed; the red beam sailed past him and hit Sirius

square in the chest.

# The Queen of Spades

The veil trembled; its surface flared forward to brush against Sirius's back as he crumpled to the floor, his mouth stretched in a soundless scream. Sirius shook and shivered on the cold stone of the dais.

Bellatrix giggled and twirled upon the top of the bench. 'I win!' She cheered. 'I win you mangy mutt! That'll teach you to sneak out of Azkaban without saying goodbye to me!'

*Mad bitch.* A tight, sharp cold closed about Harry's heart

and he hurled a trio of banishing spells at her.

The first smashed the bench away from beneath her feet, the second hammered Bellatrix out of the air and threw her back into the wall, the third sent the bench after her.

\'Sirius!\' Harry shouted.

Sirius groaned, crawling across the floor toward his wand, and slumped onto his face. Harry summoned him with one hand, dragging Sirius after him as he leapt up the steps and sprinted for the lift, throwing spells at Bellatrix and Malfoy.

A barrage of yellow curses sprayed past him, shattering the tiles and ripping ragged holes into the walls around the lift. Harry dropped Sirius to the floor, deflecting any spells he recognised and jabbing his elbow into the button until the door slid open.

\'Avada kedavra!\' Lucius Malfoy's weeping, ruined face twisted into a vicious sneer.

\'Papilionis,\' Harry whispered.

A single butterfly darted into the path of the curse and burst into a wisp of smoke. Harry hauled Sirius into the lift and mashed the button for the atrium. Bella's vivid pink curses spattered against the back of the lift. He transfigured the pieces of broken tile and masonry into glass shards and banished them down the corridor, but Bella shrieked and a ripple of magic swept the glass away.

\'Osassula!\' Harry shot one last curse through the doors and sagged against the wall, gasping for breath. A deep ache throbbed in his wand arm and a cold weariness crept into his limbs.

The lift jerked up and the lower half of the doors exploded.

Fragments of metal drew hot lines of pain across his legs and abdomen and steel shards jutted through tears in his clothes.

Harry tugged them out and tossed them away. \'Rennervate.'

He jabbed his wand at Sirius.

Sirius\'s eyes snapped open, his chest heaved, and he scrambled through his robes for his wand.

\'It\'s not there,\' Harry said. 'I couldn't summon it *and* you.'

Sirius nodded and grimaced, casting an eye over himself and pulling out the pieces of the lift door embedded in his left side. \'Any particular reason I feel like a pincushion?\'

\'They destroyed the door.\' Harry gestured to the gaping hole in the door of the lift. \'I doubt we\'ve seen the last of them, either.\'

\'They\'ll come up the shaft once we\'re out of the way. We\'re not out of this yet.\'

\'You should get out,\' Harry said. \'Without a wand, you\'ll be an easy target. I\'ll cover our backs as we go.\'

\'I\'m not leaving you.\' Sirius pushed himself up on the wall. \'I don't run away*.* I'm *not* a coward*.* The Order will be here soon, anyway.\'

Harry frowned and cast a quick tempus. *It's been almost*

*half an hour. Where are they?*

'Are you sure they got your message?\' he asked. \'They got it,\' Sirius said. \'They should be here by now.'

\'Vulnerasanentur,\' Harry whispered, pointing his wand at Sirius until the slim lacerations crept closed. 'There you go.'

\'How did you come away unscathed?\' Sirius poked his finger through the holes in his robes.

\'Luck.\' Harry glanced at the thin pink lines beneath the tears

in his clothes. 'Mostly.'

\'You\'re worse than James.\' Sirius grinned and shook his head. \'He always came out of scrapes like this without so much as a scratch.\'

\'Atrium,\' the dispassionate female voice announced as the lift ground to a halt.

Harry stepped out and Sirius staggered after him. The lift shuddered, crumpled like a crushed can and collapsed back into the dark shaft.

\'Go,\' Harry snapped.

*At least I can use more powerful spells here without bringing the building down.*

Sirius threw himself against the wall by the lift entrance and shot Harry a thumbs up.

\'Clever little Potter thought he\'d escaped.\' Bellatrix danced out of the empty shaft with a giggle. \'But you\'ll have to do more than that to beat me, only the Dark Lord ever beats me.\'

\'No more games, Bella,\' Malfoy hissed, pressing his leather- gloved fingertips against the ruined side of his face.

She laughed and shook her dark curls out in little ripples. \'It\'s *all* games,\' she cooed, her violet eyes shining like stars. 'And we *all* lose in the end.\'

Sirius hurled himself at Malfoy, driving a fist into his wounded ribs and hammering an elbow into the burnt half of his face. Malfoy's wand snapped beneath them as they rolled across the floor.

\'I guess I\'ll play with cousin Sirius later.' Bella watched them

wrestle on the floor. \'It will be fun! Sirius is good, he won't be *boring*.'

*You won't touch him or anyone else.*

Harry slashed his wand forward. The faint form of the basilisk lunged, tearing the floor apart as it swept through the atrium.

Bella rolled her eyes. \'Confringo.\'

Her spell dissipated and she flung herself across the floor with a squeak of surprise. The basilisk hammered into the lift entrance, obliterating the golden gates and the wall behind. Masonry and metal showered Sirius and Malfoy as they grappled across the floor.

\'Potter knows how to play,\' Bellatrix breathed, a little shudder rippling through her and purple light dancing in her eyes. Her wand streaked up and an array of coloured curses sliced through the air.

Harry flicked them away, sending them curving back toward her as they spiralled around one another in the centre of the atrium.

Sirius drove his fist into Malfoy's face over and over. 'You. Worthless. Fuck.' He lifted Malfoy's head and smashed it against the floor. 'Cissy. Deserved. Better!'

Bellatrix cocked her head and glanced behind her. 'You tell him, cousin Sirius! He made itty bitty baby Cissy all sad!'

\'Lacero,\' Harry whispered, melding the wand motion into a small string of other spells, pushing himself as fast as he could go.

Bellatrix deflected a few and threw up a faint, glowing bubble of white magic. Harry's spells tore through it and slashed her cheek open to the bone.

\'You got me!\' She giggled and shuddered, pressing a finger to the cut and licking the blood from the tip of it. \'I never could understand shielding.\' She sighed. \'Why hide and be boring when you can just attack?\'

A fresh volley of bright, yellow spells streaked from the tip of her wand.

*I can deflect those. Sirius did.* He sent all five hissing back at

her.

The first three splattered into the floor, leaving deep,

scorched craters at Bella\'s feet. She leant aside from the other two

and they arced past her hip and shoulder, striking Sirius in the back.

He slumped over Malfoy's prone figure.

\'Ooops!\' Bella giggled. \'Were you expecting me to deflect

them back?' She beamed. 'This is the most fun I've had in *years!*' *Fun.* The ice in his chest closed its fist. *I'll show you fun.*

Fiendfyre swirled past Bella, forcing her to the edge of the fountain. She poured her own against his and the inferno gushed across the floor, swallowing up the ground between them as it seared toward Sirius and Malfoy.

Harry extinguished them both with a grunt of effort. *That was clever.*

\'Don\'t worry little cousin Harry.\' She laughed. \'We'll be nice

to Sirius, won't we, Bell! Just give us the prophecy. Accept defeat. We'll only play with Sirius a little bit, tormenting people after they've lost gets boring, like pulling the wings off caged butterflies.\'

Harry wrapped his magic 'round the golden centaur in the fountain. It shuddered and drove its arrow through the back of Bellatrix's knee.

She hissed and shattered every stature with a swing of her wand. \'Crucio,\' she shrieked, sending a crackling red beam at Harry.

A butterfly burst from Harry's wand, swallowing the red spell in a wisp of dark mist.

\'Osassula,\' Harry whispered.

The curse tore through her desperate shield and struck her fingers, sending her wand spinning into the water behind her.

\'Perhaps Bella would like a taste of her own medicine.\' Harry summoned her wand and snapped it in front of her.

She screeched and uncontrolled magic smashed into him, tearing across the atrium floor. A wave of violet flame crashed against his shield and guttered out, knocking him back hard enough to drive the wind out of him. Shattered glass poured from his pocket onto the floor.

\'The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches\...' A hoarse, rasping voice echoed through the atrium. 'Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies\... And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not\... And either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives\... The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...*\'*

\'Equal?\' Bellatrix bounced on her feet. \'The Dark Lord has no equals, he\'s the best player in the game, but better safe than sorry, better to still be playing than to lose, better to play than to be dead, so no more little Potter, and no more little Longbottom either, Bella saw to that.\' She giggled. \'That was a fun game. They clung on for *ages*.\'

centaur.

Cold fury streaked through Harry's veins. \'Crucio,\' he spat.

A pale, red beam dissipated on the severed torso of the

\'You\'ve got to mean it, little cousin Harry.' She cocked her

head. 'If you want to beat Voldemort, then you'll *need* to mean it. He always wins. *Always*.'

*A game.* The icy thing in Harry's chest stirred. A bottomless,

freezing hunger coiled beneath his ribs, baring a maw filled with a

thousand, needle-like teeth. *She's as cruel as all the children were at*

*primary school, but capable of much more than words and bruises.*

'Crucio,' he whispered.

Bellatrix flopped and thrashed in the water of the fountain. Her eyes smouldered and her lips quivered as she clawed her way back to her feet, licking her lips. 'That burnt so *good*.'

'You're mad.' The words slipped through Harry's lips. 'No wonder Voldemort likes you. He just winds you up, then points you in the right direction and lets you go.'

'You shouldn't *try* to beat him.' Bellatrix screwed up her face. 'We're going to get rid of all the *boring* creatures. The ones who've got no magic and just lumber around in their awful world of clay and dirt.' She stuck her hand out. 'Come and play with us! You're fun!' The violet in her eyes glowed bright as the full moon. 'Andi wouldn't play with us. Andi died. Cissy's all sad and boring, like a little caged bird. But *you're* family, too! *You* can play with me instead! And we'll never be bored or sad or lonely again!'

Harry's stomach wrenched. *Lonely...*

\'Voldemort,\' Bellatrix breathed.

Harry spun, half-crouching in front of the tall, pale figure.

\'Bella\'s sorry.' She waved her broken fingers in the air. \'Bella lost. Little cousin Harry was better than Bella, and he doesn't want to come and play with us yet, but Bella heard the prophecy---\'

\'Avada kedavra,\' Harry whispered.

A bright green flash snuffed out the violet light in Bellatrix's

eyes.

\'Harry.\' Voldemort's crimson eyes watched the body of Bellatrix sink into the fountain. \'Bella was one of my most useful servants.\'

\'Not anymore.' Harry glanced at the exit. 'She lost.\'

\'Yes.\' Voldemort\'s lips curled back in a cold grin. \'She lost her never-ending game at last, but I\'m sure she enjoyed every moment.\' He surveyed the ruins of the room, taking in the spell marks around the atrium, the shattered statues, and scorch marks.

\'What was so important about the prophecy?\' Harry threw a look at Sirius out of the corner of his eye and dragged his magic up to summon him.

\'The wards are still up.\' Voldemort released a soft laugh. \'The only way out is past me, I\'m afraid, and your chance of escape would be small enough if you were fresh to the fight.' He spun his wand on his palm. 'But I will humour you. The prophecy tells of a child born with the strength to eclipse me, a wizard I can\'t allow to live because he will always be a threat.\'

\'Me,\' Harry said.

\'Perhaps,\' Voldemort whispered. \'But I never heard the entire thing and now I *know* you; I wonder if there isn\'t more to this prediction than I originally thought.'

The pale, yew wand snapped into his hand. A trio of curses flashed at Harry and slammed into the floor, showering his feet in fragments of stone.

\'Avadakedavra,\' Voldemortmurmured. Harry threw his butterflies in the way.

Voldemort smiled. His curses tore great, gaping holes through Harry\'s swarm. Harry deflected back all the curses he could manage, but some slipped through, carving long, deep gouges in the floor.

*Let's turn him 'round so I can get out of here.* Harry retreated, circling past the fountain.

The golden statues melted and flowed across the floor into the shape of a vast serpent. It coiled before the entrance, a smooth- scaled, shining wall.

*Where the fuck is the Order of the Phoenix?*

\'Ardensflagello,\' Harry hissed.

A vast swathe of purple-edged, ebony flames lashed from the tip of his wand, melting the golden serpent as if it were butter. Voldemort conjured a swirling shield of silver snakes and unleashed a torrent of red, raging Fiendfyre tongues. They swept across the atrium from floor to ceiling, obliterating the elegant golden runes and gleaming green tiles.

Harry clenched his jaw and slashed his wand forward, pouring his own Fiendfyre into the mix. The crimson flames swirled into a great serpent and surged back down the atrium.

Voldemort laughed, a cold, high sound full of genuine delight, then the floor shuddered and vast spires of stone burst forth, nailing the basilisk to the ceiling. The flames guttered out even as the stone melted, showering the floor in hissing droplets of glowing, molten rock.

\'Ever you surpass my expectations, Harry.\' Voldemort

levelled the tip of his pale wand at Harry\'s forehead. \'Legilimens.'

Harry dragged the emptiness up from beneath the ice. He threw himself into it and let hollow teeth tear every flash and flicker of feeling from him.

Voldemort lowered his wand, a fascinated smile upon his lipless mouth. \'Interesting. Even I cannot claim to exceed your gift for occlumency, not when you defend your mind as perfectly as I guard my own.\'

*He still wants the prophecy...*

\'Then you know that the knowledge of the prophecy dies

with me.'

\'If you die, I will have no need to fear it.\' Voldemort's wand

flicked back up, tracing a small semi-circle in the air. \'Contusio.'

A scatter of bright, silver pinpricks flared from Voldemort\'s wand, soaring through the air. Harry mustered the dregs of his magic, sweeping the water from the fountain across the atrium to shield himself.

Explosions tore through the air, hammering at his ears as the delicate, silver drops of light exploded against the veil of water, spraying Harry with scalding liquid.

Green flames flared in all the fireplaces.

*The Order?*

'What if I told you the prophecy?\' Harry watched the

emerald flames flicker. 'That's why you came, right?'

Voldemort watched them too. 'I wouldn't need you alive.' \'You would have no reason to kill me.'

\'The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord,\' Voldemort echoed, reforming the golden serpent Harry\'s fire had destroyed and sending it careening down the atrium, smashing through the fireplaces on the opposite wall.

\'Power's directed by intent.\' Harry drew himself up and buried the dull throb and the ache in his limbs. The weight of his life hung on his tongue.

\'I should trust in your intent, then?\' Voldemort laughed. \'A foolish risk to take; those who trust are betrayed, aren\'t they, Harry? Lord Voldemort doesn't forget his mistakes, he *learns* from them.\'

\'A trade, then,\' Harry proposed as the fireplaces\' emerald flames billowed and the floo network flared to life. \'I'll take Sirius Black and leave, you'll learn the last line of the prophecy.\'

\'Tempting,\' Voldemort mused. \'You *are* interesting.\' He twirled his wand in his fingers, just as the shade of Tom had in the chamber. Silver sparks trailed from its tip and fountained down onto the ruined floor, then the wand vanished into his sleeve. 'I accept.'

Harry flicked his wand back into its holster and summoned Sirius to him. The last dregs of his magic tugged Sirius across the floor in slow jerks.

\'The prophecy, Harry,\' Voldemort said.

*As if I'd give you all of it. I'd be dead the moment you heard*

*it.*

\'And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal,\' Harry said.

\'But he will have power the Dark Lord knows not.\'

\'Interesting. It does not say if you're able to defeat me.'

\'No,\' Harry lied. \'It doesn\'t, though I *do* wonder what the power you know not is.\'

Voldemort\'s wand appeared in his hand. Harry tensed and raised his own.

\'I was going to kill you anyway,\' Voldemort said. \'But I\'m curious, Harry, to see what you'll become. Someone once told me I should find an equal, though I never really believed it would come true. I wonder, though, if there might have been a chance after all.\'

*Salazar...* Harry kept a straight face.

\'You did mark me as an equal.\' He ran his forefinger along his faded scar.

\'Self-fulfilling prophecy,\' Voldemort murmured. \'And now there is this power I know not. Until next time we meet, and I\'m sure our paths *will* cross again, Dumbledore will insist upon it. He is the only other who knows the full prophecy.\'

*Especially if he knows the whole thing.* Harry smothered a grimace. *Either must die at the hand of the other... No wonder he wants to make a martyr of me.*

A pair of soft snaps echoed through the atrium as Voldemort flickered from one side of the room to where Malfoy lay and vanished, ripping through the anti-apparition wards like wet paper.

Harry glanced around. A thick silence hung over the ruined room and Bellatrix\'s pale body floated among the shattered statues and rubble in the fountain.

*If this doesn't convince the Ministry something's going on,*

*then there\'s no point in continuing to try.*

He took a firm grip on Sirius, then focused on the Chamber of Secrets and twisted the world back away from him. A flash of phoenix-red flame seared his eyes and Dumbledore's soft sigh echoed through the atrium as he vanished with a soft snap.

Harry staggered across the smooth stone of the chamber and dropped Sirius\'s body on the floor. Ragged gasps tore from his throat and he pressed his forehead into the cold stone wall. *The Order of the Phoenix never came.Another of Dumbledore's attempts to make a martyr of me, no doubt.*

'Don't say anything, Salazar!' Harry clawed a little magic up from within and forced the tongue bridge to sink into the pool and the study\'s door to close. \'Rennervate.'

\'What hit me this time?\' Sirius shot him a weak grin. \'Bellatrix tricked me. She manoeuvred herself between us

and when I sent her spells back at her she let them go on to strike

you.\'

\'She was always dangerous,\' Sirius said. \'What about the prophecy? And the Order?\' He glanced around. \'This isn\'t Grimmauld Place, either.\'

\'I\'ll tell you the story from when you started your impromptu nap,\' Harry quipped, sagging down against one of the serpent effigies. He tried to blot out the deep ache and the weight tugging at his eyelids. 'If I can keep my eyes open.'

\'Go ahead.' Sirius rolled over onto his back. 'I might fall asleep, too.'

\'After you were knocked out, I duelled Bellatrix in the atrium and disarmed her, but the orb containing the prophecy was broken and we both heard the words.\'

\'So Voldemort will know what it says,\' Sirius said. \'What *did*

it say?\'

\'The birth of the one with the power to defeat Voldemort.

My birth. And then, *either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives*. Bellatrix heard the whole thing, but when Voldemort turned up, I killed her before she could tell him.\'

Sirius flinched. 'You killed her.'

\'She deserved to die, if not worse.'

Sirius's grey eyes darkened. 'My favourite cousin died a very long time ago, I just didn\'t expect you to be capable of it. James and Lily never were.\'

'What choice was there?' Harry shrugged. 'If I let her live, she might've cost me something much more important later.'

*Someone\...* He stifled a groan. *Fleur's going to be really*

*pissed.*

\'So what happened then?\' Sirius asked.

\'We duelled again in the atrium, made a bit of a mess of it,

actually.\' Harry grinned. \'Somehow he knew the first lines of it already, but I told him most of the rest in return for being able to leave with you. The Order of the Phoenix didn't turn up, though I\'m sure I saw Dumbledore just as I apparated us away.'

\'I sent the warning,\' Sirius muttered. \'They should've come, they all know what it means.\'

\'The last line of the prophecy,\' Harry murmured. 'That's why they didn't come. Either must die at the hand of the other...'

\'But Dumbledore *must* know you're not ready to face Voldemort alone and kill him yet!'

\'That\'s not very pure of heart,\' Harry whispered. \'Surely a martyr\'s death to ensure Voldemort\'s end is preferable. A noble sacrifice, just like my mother's\...'

Sirius's grey eyes flashed. \'That absolute cunt! *That\'s* why he won\'t let me take custody of you, *that\'s* why he sends you back to your relatives, why he pushes you into acts of heroism and pretends you risking your life for others is the best you could ever hope to do!\'

\'He wants a malleable, naive child to throw into Voldemort\'s path,\' Harry said. \'No doubt he believes that the power the Dark Lord knows not is something abstract, pure-hearted, and perfectly heroic.\'

\'Love,\' Sirius snapped. \'He has often made reference to your ability to love and risk yourself for others. He expects you to die like Lily did, only with a more permanent effect.\'

'I have no intention of dying.'

*If I die, I'll never see Fleur again.* He shuddered. *And the emptiness will have me forever.*

'I\'m going to tear that wrinkled shit-stain apart with my bare hands. I\'m *done* with his Order of the Phoenix. I bet Snape knew about the attack tonight and poor Mundungus was just another *sacrifice*.\'

\'No.\' Harry shook his head. \'We need to know what he\'s doing if he intends to make a martyr of me.\'

\'So I should stay and spy.\' Sirius took several long, deep

breaths. 'Like Snape.'

\'I don\'t trust Dumbledore or his Order and I don\'t need them, either,\' Harry said. \'I was strong enough to defeat Bellatrix. I\'ve survived Voldemort alone twice. We\'ll be fine without him.\'

'You can\'t stay with your relatives or come to Grimmauld.

He'll be able to find you.\' Sirius glanced around. 'What about here?'

\'The Chamber of Secrets?\' Harry chuckled at Sirius's gobsmacked expression. \'It\'s one of two rooms in this castle not on the Marauders\' Map and my backdoor in and out of the castle, but it's not very comfortable.\'

*I promised Fleur, but I'm not telling him unless I have to. The*

*longer nobody knows, the safer Fleur is.* \'I\'ll sort something out,\' he said. \'Do you promise?\' Sirius asked.

\'I promise. I won\'t spend a single night with the Dursleys.\'

\'I guess I should go back to Grimmauld Place, then.\' Sirius sighed. \'What do I tell Dumbledore?\'

'Tell him as little as possible about what really happened. It

helps that you were unconscious.\'

\'I\'ll tell him that I felt something was wrong, snuck in, and destroyed the prophecy when I found Voldemort coming to take it,\' Sirius decided. \'Will he know you were there?\'

\'He will. If Voldemort didn't take the prophecy, it must've been me. Lie to him, though. He won't be surprised you're defending me and I can answer his questions myself when he comes to me.'

\'I\'ll say nothing I don\'t know he already knows.\' Sirius grinned. \'It\'s like trying to avoid detention with McGonagall.\'

Harry laughed. \'Only you would compare getting out of detention to lying to the strongest wizard alive.'

\'They\'re not that different when you get right down to it.\' Sirius struggled to his feet. \'I should go. This Chamber of Secrets of yours is creepy, it\'s the sort of place my mother would dream about. You should go to bed,\' he quipped. \'Don\'t you have exams this year?\'

*I actually do.* Brief amusement flickered through Harry's

tired body. *And I better beat Fleur, or she'll never let me forget it.*

Sirius stuck out a foot and closed his eyes. 'What the...?' 'You can\'t apparate out of here.\' Harry chuckled. \'You\'ll have

to sneak out via Hogsmeade in your animagus form. I\'ll open the

entrance into the castle for you, follow me.'

# Forgive Me, Madeira?

Harry staggered into the study and slumped into the chair,

leaning his head back and releasing a long sigh. 'I'm *still* tired.'

\'You slept for almost ten hours.\' Salazar cracked a broad grin and poked his snake's nose, snatching his finger out the way of its tongue. 'But you did *very* well, Harry. Well done.'

'Not well enough.' Harry dragged himself out of his chair. 'Fleur arrives in London today. I *really* need to find some sort of bribe to distract her until she's calmed down enough not to melt my face off.'

Salazar snorted. 'I like this girl of yours.'

'So do I.' Harry murmured. 'Enough to stake my face on the slim hope her love of cake will outweigh her desire to immediately immolate me.'

\'My wife would've understood.\' Salazar cackled. \'But she would've made sure I felt every iota of her anger all the same.\'

'You're enjoying this, aren't you?'

\'Yes,\' Slytherin snarked. 'Now, tell me about this witch you killed? How powerful was she?'

\'To use her own words, nobody had ever beaten her except Voldemort. She was probably weakened, having only just escaped from Azkaban, but there aren\'t many wizards or witches I'd confidently bet could beat her.\'

\'Good.' Salazar ran a finger down his snake's spine. 'Very

good. You will need all that strength, cunning and skill soon. And

you'll need that girl, too. You can't do it alone, Harry. Winning alone

is meaningless. *Don't lose her.*'

'I know,' Harry whispered. 'I won't lose her.' Salazar's eyes bored into Harry's. 'I do wonder why

Voldemort let you go. Tom would've never fallen for a trick like that.

He would've made an ally or a corpse of you.'

\'He wants to see what I will become.\' Harry recalled Voldemort's words in the atrium. \'You told him to find equals too, didn\'t you?\'

Shadows clustered in Salazar's eyes. 'Everything I've told you, I once told him.'

'He's *curious,* I think. About me. He remembers what you

told him.'

\'I think you're likely right,\' Salazar murmured. \'Voldemort is not Tom. The brilliant boy I taught has been twisted into something terrible. Was it me, I wonder? Or did something else gnaw at him until there was nothing left?'

'It's not your fault.' Harry stretched for some words. 'You taught me the same things and I haven't ended up like him.'

'Not yet,' Salazar whispered. 'That's why it's so important you keep hold of that girl, Harry. She's the one thing you have I don't remember him having.'

Harry crushed all thought of their similarities. 'My soul's healing. I have Fleur. I'll never end up like him.'

*I have something perfect. Voldemort has nothing.*

'Go to her, then.' Salazar stroked his goatee. 'I will muse about whether a prophecy that was told but never heard or learnt about would actually come to pass.\'

\'Is the answer to that immediately important?\' Harry asked. \'Just because it seems to have no relevance now does not

mean it will not be useful later.\' Salazar crossed his arms. 'And don't

think I don't know your disdain for interesting pieces of magic is completely feigned.'

'I'm going. Have fun.' Harry pictured Diagon Alley and

apparated into the doorway of Ollivander's.

A crowd of witches and wizards bustled back and forth along the street. Harry glanced toward Gringotts, then slipped through the hustle into a seat in one of the small cafes.

A slim, freckled witch walked to his table. Her eyes flicked

to Harry's forehead and she gulped. 'Er... What would you like?' 'Something sweet.' Harry ran his eyes down the menu.

*Madeira cake will work. She liked pound cake and they're not too dissimilar.* He double-checked the menu. *Nothing with plums or marzipan, unfortunately.*

'Sure.' She shuffled her feet. 'Anything to drink?'

'Not for me, thanks.' Harry put the menu down. 'Do you have any cake with plums in it?'

She blinked, then shook her head. 'Not today. The special's carrot cake.'

'No worries.' He flashed her a bright smile. 'The madeira cake will do for me, then.'

*And now to have my face melted off.* Harry pulled the acorn

from under his clothes. 'Azure.'

Fleur's pitch-black eyes glared from the polished surface. 'Bonjour, monCœur. I read a *very* interesting article this morning before I apparated to Gringotts. The atrium of your ministry looked like a *warzone* in the photo... Comment voulez-vousmourir?'

Harry grimaced. 'I'm just down the road at that café with the blue umbrellas you told me about, so you can come and set fire to me now, if you like.'

The mirror shrank back into a seed. Harry tucked it away and twisted around to watch the street. His stomach knotted and churned, sweat coated his palms, and his heart writhed beneath his ribs.

'Your cake.' The freckled witch slid a plate of madeira cake in front of him.

'Thanks.' He chuckled. 'You're a lifesaver.'

She flushed. 'Let me know if you need anything else.'

Soft, hot hands slipped into his hair and tugged to the point of pain. 'Flirting with the waitress is *not* a good idea, monCœur,' Fleur whispered in his ear.

Harry poked the plate of madeira cake toward the empty seat next to him with one finger. 'I was actually being completely literal.'

Fleur huffed and released him, dropping into the seat and stealing his fork. 'This is mine now.' Her eyes shifted from ink-black to midnight blue. 'All of it.'

A small smile crept onto Harry's lips. 'It was always all yours. I'm trying to bribe you into forgiving me.'

'It will not work.' She jabbed the fork at him and slapped a copy of the Daily Prophet onto the table. 'I am going to eat this cake. You are going to explain *this*.'

*Break-In at the Department of Mysteries.* Harry skimmed the front page. *Atrium Destroyed in Overnight Duel Between Intruders. Bellatrix Lestrange Found Dead.*

'Things didn\'t go as we planned. Voldemort went after it

too.'

you?'

\'Lestrange?\' Fleur lowered her voice to a faint whisper. 'Did

'Yes.' He managed a grin. 'It was a close thing, getting out.' Fleur's eyes flashed black and she drove her heel into the

top of his foot. Pain seared up his leg. \'It isn\'t funny,\' she hissed. \'I\'ve been on the verge of *panic*. I had to sit in France and wait to hear if you were still alive to meet me today!'

*She worried about me.* Gentle warmth flooded Harry's

heart. *She didn't just sit back and wait for me to save the day.*

\'Now I know how Gabby feels.\' He nursed his foot and cast a glance at her red heels. 'Did you choose the sharpest ones you own?'

'Yes.' Fleur crossed her arms. 'I did. You deserve it.' She took a forkful of cake. 'Now keep going, you have *not* finished your explanation.'

'Right\... Sirius and I duelled Malfoy and Lestrange after acquiring the prophecy, my godfather and Malfoy were unconscious, but Bellatrix and I both heard it. I killed her when Voldemort arrived so she couldn\'t tell him.\'

Fleur's eyes shifted to blue and she pulled her wand out

and traced it over him. The tip drew faint, gentle lines down his neck.

Harry shivered and twitched away. 'That tickles, Fleur.' 'Stay still.'

Harry let her run her wand over him. 'Done?'

'No magic but your own that I can find.' Fleur put her wand away and picked her fork back up. 'So you know the prophecy now?'

He nodded. 'Either I'm going to kill him or he's going to kill me.' Harry risked a glance into Fleur's blue eyes. 'Dumbledore knows the entire thing. He believes it requires me to sacrifice myself and take Voldemort with me like my mother almost did.\'

Fleur's slim shoulders tensed and her lip trembled. She tugged his hand across the table and slipped her fingers through his. 'I hope you're not even *considering* such a ridiculous idea.'

\'No.' Harry shook his head. \'It seems like he wants me to willingly walk to my death at Voldemort\'s hand, though, so he will at least not try anything beyond engineering opportunities for me to get myself killed.\'

'Like your little escapade yesterday.' Fleur's face tightened. 'You hurled yourself right into his trap, Harry!'

'Maybe,' Harry murmured. 'Dumbledore *did* arrive just as I

left and long after the duel should've ended based on what he knows

about my skill. I'd wager everything but you that Snape, his Death Eater spy, told him the prophecy was being stolen tonight and he intended to let me be lured there.\'

Fleur set her fork down with a sharp click and brushed crumbs off her cheek. 'So get rid of Voldemort, then Dumbledore can eat a huge slice of humble pie.'

*Merde.* Harry stifled a grimace. *There's no way around it*

*now.*

'That won't work,' he said.

\'Why?\' Fleur's grip on his hand tightened until Harry winced.

'Why not?!'

\'I told you about horcruxes,\' he murmured. 'I *didn't* tell you that any object can become one, *living* or otherwise.\'

The life drained from Fleur's face like the sunset's light faded from Harry's dreams.. \'You\'re a horcrux. *Another secret!*' The shape of her face shifted and her eyes swelled to near twice their usual size, short white feathers sprouting from her bare arms.

Harry's heart twisted beneath his ribs. \'I *was*. Not anymore.

That's why I didn't tell you.'

'But if you don't die, then Dumbledore won't believe Voldemort has,\' Fleur murmured, her features shifting back. \'I assume you've considered telling him.\'

'I don't trust him to stop.' Harry stared into the grain of the table. 'And if he knows I know, then who knows what he'll do. I'll have to try and trick him somehow, otherwise...'

Fleur dragged his arm into her lap, hauling Harry and his chair around the edge of the table. 'Was that *all* that happened at the Department of Mysteries?'

Their reflections in the shining glass of the Mirror of Erised and the clear dream of a silver-haired, green-eyed girl swirled through Harry's head. *Another perfect wish.* He buried the image. *One's more than I ever hoped for. Fleur might not even like it.*

\'That was pretty much everything.'

\'Then let\'s go to Gringotts.\' She stood. \'I've drawn up a contract to purchase the small home in Budleigh Babberton for around one hundred and ten thousand galleons, since you decided to vanish for the whole morning. Once we\'ve paid a certain percentage, it'll become binding, the house will be ours, and we\'ll have a decade to pay the rest off before the goblins get tetchy.\'

'Ah.' Harry hopped out of his chair and took her arm. 'You want me to empty my vault for you.' He feigned a serious face. 'You know this will greatly affect how much cake I'm able to buy you?'

'Not if you want me to keep forgiving you for doing stupid, reckless things, it won't,' Fleur murmured. 'It's good I'm here to keep a close eye on you now.'

Harry rummaged for a handful of sickles and put them beside the empty plate. He gave the waitress a wave as they left.

'Really?' Fleur's grip tightened. 'I'm *right here*.'

'I was just letting her know we were leaving,' Harry

protested. 'Are you secretly the jealous type?'

Fleur ground to a halt and tugged him 'round to face her. 'Not *secretly.* I *am* the jealous type.' A pout crept onto her lips. 'I do not share.'

Harry laughed. 'I guess it's a good thing I don't have loads of

female friends.'

'Just Katie Bell...' Fleur's eyes narrowed and darkened to ocean blue. 'Who I would *love* to meet, now I'm in England, monCœur.'

He grimaced. 'Really? You're not just going to pick a fight with her?'

Fleur huffed and stalked toward Gringotts. 'I'm just going to make sure she knows how things are. I doubt you've even told a single person about me. In fact, I'm certain you haven't.' She whirled on him. 'The painting doesn't count!'

*She doesn't trust me?* Harry flinched and a chill crept through him. *What did I do?*

'Not for *that* reason,' he murmured. 'I just---\'

Fleur's brow creased and she pressed a finger to his lips. 'I didn't mean it like that. I just want to make sure she's not up to anything devious. I *know* the sort of games some girls try to steal a boy's attention away from other girls. But nobody's stealing you from me.' Her eyes darkened. 'I will *burn* them.'

*Definitely the jealous sort.* Harry tried to remind himself that it was supposed to be a bad thing, but warmth swirled around his heart and a smile crept onto his lips. *Too late for logic, I suppose.*

They strode through the door of Gringotts and looked about for an empty desk.

Harry spotted one at the far end of the line of closed desks.

\'There\'s one on the far side.'

The goblin fixed them with a long stare as they approached.

'What do you need, humans?'

'I made an inquiry about inheriting a number of vaults from different families not long ago.' Harry glanced around him at the handful of other clients in the bank. 'I'd like to know if anything came of it.'

\'Mr Potter...\' The goblin's grin widened to reveal a set of very sharp teeth. \'You caused quite a stir with some of your claims; step this way and a spokes-goblin will be with you shortly.\'

The goblin ushered them into a small room in the corridor just behind his desk, then hurried off.

\'I seem to have caused trouble,\' Harry remarked.

\'You\'re quite gifted at it.\' Fleur leant her shoulder into his. \'Even worse than Gabby.\'

Harry laughed. \'That seems a little unfair. I've not stolen your cake, stained anything with chocolate, pretended to elope with your boyfriend, or hoarded an unreasonable number of shoes.'

Fleur turned her nose up. \'Perhaps, but my baby sister hasn\'t destroyed any centres of government in the last week.\'

\'Give her a few years,\' Harry said. 'She'll get there.'

A wrinkled, iron-haired goblin entered the room carrying a file half as thick as Harry\'s waist. \'I am Bodak.' He dropped the file on the table with a loud thud. \'The senior spokes-goblin for Gringotts in

Britain; it is a pleasure to meet you, Mr Potter. I presume this is Miss Delacour.\'

\'The pleasure is mine,\' Harry said.

'Oh no, Mr Potter.' Bodak grinned. \'The pleasure is *ours*, we've not had a request as *interesting* as yours in some time.\' He opened the file, pulling out the top piece of parchment, an ancient, worn thing covered in faded writing. It'd been torn in half, then taped together and stamped in gobbledegook.

*I hope that's not our property deed.*

\'This is the marriage agreement between one Selena Slytherin and Rufinius Gaunt; it was annulled after the former had a child out of wedlock with another man and died giving birth. Gaunt married Selena's sister under a separate agreement instead and the Slytherin name disappeared. The dowry has sat in a vault gathering dust since Gaunt refused it and there's never been a Slytherin not from the Gaunt line to accept his refusal so that the Gaunt family could then inherit the money anyway.' Bodak flicked through the paperwork beneath, showing off endless sheets of coat of arms. 'Wizarding law is so fascinatingly obtuse, sometimes... It took some searching to find the bastard son to corroborate *your* claim, Mr Potter, but it turns out he was quietly adopted by a member of the Potter family not long afterward. This wouldn't normally be enough to prove your lineage, but your ability to speak to serpents satisfies us and we'd much rather that gold was earning interest. Therefore, the dowry belongs to you. It's about sixty five thousand galleons, once adjusted for inflation.\'

*So the link to Salazar is old, but the Potter family hasn't been able to speak to snakes or everyone would know about it.* Harry frowned. *Perhaps Salazar's blood magic requires more than just his blood. I'll ask him.*

\'And the other inquiries?\'

\'Unsuccessful.\' Bodak pulled a thin sheet of paper out from inside the cover of the file. \'Though you would've had a claim on anything they had left, there's nothing to be claimed.\'

'Thank you.'

\'Should I transfer the money into the Potter family vault?\' Bodak asked.

\'No,\' Fleur said. \'There's a contract drawn up under our names for a property in Budleigh Babberton, we'd like to make the first payment on it.\'

*I suppose we might as well.*

Bodak looked between them, then nodded. \'I\'ll transfer the money straight from the dowry account to the former owner\'s. If I pay the rest of the cost of the property using the money from your trust vault, Mr Potter, you will have the house in your name before the stamp duty law changes. That will shave a few thousand galleons off the final price.\'

Harry raised an eyebrow at Fleur. She nodded. \'How much will be left in my trust vault?\' he asked.

\'Approximately three thousand galleons,\' Badok replied. \'It will be topped up in a few months\' time, though, and it remains impossible for you to exhaust more than half your inheritance until you come of age.\'

\'Do it,\' Harry said.

\'It will be done, Mr Potter.\' Badok extended one long- fingered hand in his direction.

Harry shook it, hiding his distaste at the cold, leathery texture of the goblin\'s skin.

\'I assume Gringotts will take its brokerage cut,\' Fleur said. \'The commission is included in the initial price on the

contract, Miss Delacour,\' Bodak said. \'The property will be yours in no

more time than it takes me to walk from this room to my office.\' Badok scooped up his enormous file and swept out.

\'I\'ll pay you back half the cost of the house when I can afford it,\' Fleur murmured. \'We can do it officially through Gringotts to ensure we have half each.\'

\'I don\'t mind,\' Harry said. 'As long as you're safe.' Fleur pouted. \'I don\'t like being in your debt.'

\'You\'re so *proud*.\' Harry fought the smile that threatened to spread across his face and lost horribly.

Fleur stuck her chin in the air and pushed her lower lip out a

little further. 'You love me.'

Harry pressed a gentle kiss to her pout. 'I definitely do.' 'You'd better.' Fleur dragged his mouth back to hers when

he pulled away and let out a quiet moan. 'The Fidelius Charm isn't easy to cast and Gabby's price for being the secret keeper is a small mountain of sweets and a private talk with you.'

'A *what* with me?' Harry grinned. 'Does that mean Gabby and I finally get to run away together to enjoy our forbidden romance?'

'I would be able to find you in less than five minutes.' Fleur's soft laugh echoed through the room. 'She'd take you straight to Paris

to buy her clafoutis again.' The smile faded from her face. 'I must go and finish my paperwork for my job, monCœur.'

*Leaving me.* Harry's stomach knotted.

'Don't flirt with any waitresses, mon Rêve,' he said.

She disappeared into the corridors with a quiet laugh.

Harry sighed as the cold crept in to take her place and strode back out to the street, twisting the world back past him until he stood in the Chamber of Secret's study.

'Well, your face seems fine. Better than mine, anyway.' Salazar pushed his serpent's tongue away from his cheek. 'Get *off*, you *wretched* creature.'

Harry snorted. 'I avoided a fiery death with some tactical

application of cake and now own a house for the summer.'

'Congratulations.' Salazar yawned. 'Make sure you ward it.

You don't want any uninvited guests.'

'I will.' Harry paused. 'Well, Fleur will. She's probably going to enjoy showing off how good she is.'

'She's living with you?' Salazar ran his fingers through his goatee. 'Good. That's very good. I don't want you spending the whole summer alone.'

'I don't dislike you quite so much as to avoid coming here for the whole summer,' Harry quipped.

Darkness crept into Salazar's eyes. 'Be careful with your wards, Harry. Don't leave any loopholes.'

Harry nodded. 'I won't.' He collapsed into the chair. 'I discovered how we're related, too. One of your descendants had a child out of wedlock with a Potter.'

'That explains why you didn't know.' Salazar wound his snake 'round his arm, then unwound it again. 'I guess they tried to be discreet.'

'Nobody seems to have been able to speak Parseltongue until me, though.' Harry raised an eyebrow at the painting. 'Why's that?'

'Magic.' Salazar sighed. 'All my blood have the ability, but only my *family* can speak to serpents. I was careful with my intent; I didn't want my descendants to be abducted and used for that power. At least one person of my blood with the ability must consider you family, or the gift never awakens when you start to learn to speak.'

'Tom?'

'His mother would've considered him family. Merope Gaunt.' Harry frowned. 'And me?'

Salazar's lips twisted. 'I'm unsure, but I suspect it may have been the horcrux within you. It is Voldemort's will and magic, but the fragment would've known you were family the moment it possessed you. Blood magics are not an easy thing to conceal from your own kin.'

'And he considered me *family*.' Harry's eyebrows shot up. 'I highly doubt that.'

'Tom considered his muggle father and relatives family too.' Salazar's tone turned bleak as the stark stone floor of the chamber. 'I'm fairly sure he killed them all.'

'I suppose it doesn't matter.' Harry toyed with the golden hourglass. 'There's something else I've been meaning to ask you... If I use this, what sort of side-effects might happen?'

Salazar frowned. 'Besides growing old a little bit faster? Your mind needs to sleep every so often to cope with the mental strain of everything you do, a little like resting after doing a lot of physical activity. Using the time-turner increases the mental strain between periods of rest.'

'Could it cause dreams?' Harry asked.

'Having nightmares, are you? Mental strain can present in all

sorts of ways, as far as I know, but it's not my area of expertise. You're already under plenty of stress, Harry.' Salazar pointed his wand at the time-turner. 'Use it sparingly. I said nothing and let you abuse it last year, because a bit more strain and stress was worth risking. This year, it's not.'

# Second Chances

Bellatrix's body bobbed like a cork in the photo of the atrium's fountain beneath where Hedwig's talons obscured the Daily Prophet's headline. Harry stacked up the copies of yesterday's Daily Prophet and dropped them onto the bench out of his way.

Hedwig fluffed her feathers and stared at Harry.

'There's no bacon yet.' He met Hedwig's amber gaze. 'You're worse than Katie.'

Harry pulled the menu of Madame Antoinette's out of this pocket and scanned it. *Aha, marzipan and plums. Finally.* He slid his wand from his sleeve and tapped the tart; it glowed a soft blue.

He folded it up and charmed it shut, passing it to Hedwig.

'Collect it and then deliver it to Fleur, please, Hedwig.'

Hedwig released a soft hoot, then fluttered out the window.

*That ought to make Fleur smile.*

'Anyone seen Hermione?' Ron asked, peering down the

table.

'Library,' Seamus said.

Parvati nodded. 'She's revising so much I don't think she's

slept this week. Every time I get up in the night to get a drink, she's reading by wand light in her bed.'

'Could be worse, Parv,' Seamus said. 'Mandy Brocklehurst's been in the infirmary three times for calming draughts today.'

*Hermione's going to beat all of us anyway*. Harry yawned.

*Don't know why she gets so wound up over it when she already knows everything you could possibly need for the exam.*

Katie swung herself in next to him, clattering his goblet to the floor. \'Morning Harry. Long time no see.\' She yawned. 'I'm so tired today. Can you do my transfiguration work for me?'

\'I\'ve been busy.' Harry retrieved his cup. 'And no, I'm definitely not doing your work for you.'

She made a noncommittal noise somewhere between a sigh and another yawn, then leant an elbow on his shoulder and used her arm as a pillow. \'Where\'s McGonagall?'

\'No idea.\' Harry displaced her onto the table with one hand.

'Haven't seen her.'

\'Food.\' Katie perked up and stole the toast rack out from

under Harry's nose.

He summoned it back into his hand.

\'You\'re annoying.\' She pouted and glowered at him from beneath a scatter of brown hair. \'First you all but disappear, then you steal my breakfast!\'

\'I would feel a great deal guiltier if I didn\'t know you considered the latter the more heinous crime.' Harry poked the toast rack back toward her.

\'Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.' Katie wagged her finger at him. 'Ron understands.\' She giggled and pointed down the table at Seamus and Dean's futile attempts to part Ron from the plate of sausages.

\'You should be encouraging me to eat, then.' Harry dragged the bacon across and draped a few slices over his toast. 'If it's so important.'

\'I am.\' She stuck out her tongue. \'Just not from my food.\' The twins slipped into the seats opposite. \'The bacon---\' 'Katie deariest---\'

\'Is for everyone on the table.\'

\'Nobody ever told me that.' Katie crossed her arms.

\'We tell you that every mealtime we\'re with you, don\'t we, George?\' the leftmost twin said.

\'We do.'

'Quidditch practice is tonight,' Fred said. 'Angelina organised

another one.\'

\'Right before exams?\' Katie asked.

\'Quidditch is far more important than OWLs or NEWTs,'

Harry quipped.

\'Harry.\' Both of the twins dipped their heads at him, then shuffled down the bench toward Alicia and Angelina.

\'Harry.\' Nev slid into a gap across from him. \'You\'re looking cheerful.\'

\'I am?\'

\'You will be in a moment if you've not already seen it. Your favourite politician has been forced to tender his resignation.\' Nev pulled today's paper out of his pocket. 'Gran sent me an early copy.'

*Fudge Resigns.* The headline sat above an unflattering photo of Fudge with his head in his hands and Bellatrix's body in the atrium's fountain. *All Educational Decrees Revoked.*

\'Gran said it was only a matter of time once it became obvious Voldemort had returned. The Wizengamot voted to show no confidence in him after half the Ministry\'s atrium was torn apart and the Department of Mysteries broken into. Apparently, only Dumbledore\'s appearance managed to prevent anything terrible from happening.\'

Harry borrowed Nev's paper and flicked through the first few pages. *Dumbledore duels He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in Ministry.* Harry clenched his jaw. *Or did he just set everyone else up to die and swoop in at the last moment to play hero?*

\'Is something wrong?\' Katie put a hand on his arm. 'Harry?' 'Just surprised the Daily Prophet managed to change its

tune so fast from slandering Dumbledore to this story.\'

*It doesn't matter*. *I've got what I need.*

'War\'s coming now,' Nev said. 'I\'m going to continue the DA

next year. We\'ll all need the practice.'

*I doubt any of you will be doing much fighting. Voldemort's*

*not after you.*

\'I\'ll help if you want,\' Harry offered. 'When I can.'

\'Maybe every now and then,\' Nev replied. 'I can handle it for the most part.'

'[Aw](http://www/)w[w.](http://www/)' Katie pouted. \'I enjoyed Harry teaching the Patronus Charm.\'

\'Only because you managed it so quickly.\' Nev said. \'In all the other meetings, you either sat around with Harry and did nothing, or sat around on your own and did nothing.\'

\'That\'s not true!' Katie monopolised the plate of bacon. 'I'm ninety nine percent sure.'

'I suppose you did transfigure Smith\'s robes into a short, pink dress after he called Harry a spiteful coward with no interest or care in anyone else\'s well being.\'

\'He didn\'t look very good in it.\' Katie wrinkled her nose. 'But he did deserve it.'

\'Maybe it was because of the colour,\' Nev suggested.

\'It was his legs,\' Katie said. \'He doesn\'t have the calves to pull off a dress like that, especially not with all that leg hair.\'

Nev shuddered. \'McGonagall still isn\'t here.'

\'Ominous.\' Katie eyed the empty spot on the teacher\'s table. \'Maybe Umbridge\'s back?\'

*I doubt it. Aragog doesn't seem the type to easily relinquish anything, least of all a live meal wrapped in webbing and suspended a hundred metres above the ground.*

\'I hope not.\' Nev chuckled. \'She hasn\'t exactly been missed.\'

\'Your gift of understatement is second to none, Nev.' Harry

helped himself to a bit more breakfast.

Nev watched him pile food onto his plate. \'Don't we have a

lesson now?\'

\'Nope.'

\'Well, we're *meant* to have a lesson, but I guess for you it's just extra breakfast.'

'If Katie leaves any for the rest of us,' Harry said.

She growled. \'There\'s plenty of toast, and eggs, and sausages---\'

\'But no bacon,' Harry teased.

\'Well I actually go to my lessons, so I need my energy.' Katie beamed. 'You just skive and for some reason nobody does anything.'

'I think the teachers mostly take pity on me.'

'Not Umbridge or Snape.' She laughed. 'I heard Snape

*smiled* when you stopped turning up.'

'That's obviously just a rumour,' Harry replied. 'If he'd actually smiled, he'd've given away the fact he's a vampire.'

Katie giggled. 'That explains a lot.'

\'McGonagall\'s here,\' Nev muttered. \'And she *is* smiling*.*\' Harry glanced up.

McGonagall moved to stand in front of her old seat, not the gold, gilt throne of the headteacher. \'It gives me great pleasure to

announce the return of Professor Dumbledore as headmaster again. He's just arrived at the castle and bids me to tell you that he greatly enjoyed his holiday, but simply couldn\'t stay away longer.\'

Harry's heart sank. *Damn him. I was so close to slipping free in the chaos. So bloody close.*

\'Gran will be happy, she wasn\'t expecting he\'d be able to come back until next year.\' Nev joined in the applause that rose from every table but the one in silver and green.

*Her and I both.* Harry smothered a scowl. *I bet I'll be*

*summoned to his office before the end of the day.*

McGonagall took her seat, beginning her own, belated breakfast and Harry went back to toying with the last piece of toast.

\'You don\'t seem particularly cheerful about Dumbledore\'s return, Harry,\' Katie murmured, setting her bacon sandwich down with a serious expression. \'Is there something I should know?\'

*No doubt.* A little warmth curled through Harry's chest. *I guess she really meant that promise about not letting me down.*

'Recently, I've started to feel something's not quite right,' Harry whispered in her ear. 'The greatest wizard in the world, but he can't figure out a basilisk is roaming the school when twelve year old Hermione can? Hiring a man possessed by Voldemort in my first year and not noticing anything? And don't even get me started on him allowing Umbridge to torture students with that bloody quill.'

Katie squirmed and gave Harry's knee a squeeze. 'I hope you're wrong.'

'So do I.' Harry leant back and vanished ketchup off his knee. 'You've ketchup on your hands, Katie dearest.'

She turned them over and flushed, then licked the ketchup off with the tip of her tongue. Harry raised an eyebrow. Katie gave him a wink and made a show of sucking the sauce off her other finger.

Nev groaned. 'Please not while I'm here, you two.'

\'I have to go, anyway.\' Katie sighed. \'McGonagall will notice if I\'m not in her lesson.\'

'You might get away with it,' Harry suggested.

'I\'ll see you later, Harry.' Katie shot him a mock glower. 'You owe me for vanishing.'

'I gave you my firebolt,' Harry said. 'If anything, *you* owe *me*.'

\'Bribery doesn\'t work on me.\' Katie beamed and grabbed her

bag. 'It's mine now.'

\'That\'s a lie.\' Angelina appeared, Alicia in tow. \'Have you tried offering her firewhiskey chocolates?\'

'No. Would that really work better than a firebolt?'

'Not for important stuff,' Katie shot over her shoulder. She pointed two fingers at him from the bridge of her nose. 'No running away. I will find you.'

Harry blew her a kiss and laughed at Alicia's scowl. *She's*

*never forgiven me for that Rita Skeeter article.*

Katie laughed, pretending to snatch it from the air and cup it to her chest, then vanished into the crowd.

\'Good,\' Nev muttered. \'We can talk freely now.\'

\'You can trust Katie, Nev,\' Harry said.

\'I know, but this isn\'t something I want to talk about with anyone else.\'

'Oh?'

'Dumbledore killed Bellatrix Lestrange,' Nev whispered. His

knuckles whitened around his fork. 'I used to *dream* of killing her.\'

Harry weighed his words. 'Albus Dumbledore doesn\'t believe in killing. He'd rather offer a second chance to those who've committed crimes, even those who have done something truly *unforgivable*. He'd have stuck her back in Azkaban if it'd been him.\'

\'She would've just escaped *again*,\' Nev hissed. 'Any Death

Eaters sent to Azkaban will simply escape and rejoin Voldemort.\'

'I'm sure they would,' Harry replied. 'But Dumbledore values the moral high ground more than that.'

'They'd carry on killing and torturing.\' Nev\'s voice went distant and faint, and his eyes simmered with rage. 'Doesn't he feel at *all* responsible?'

'I don\'t know.' Harry shrugged. 'A little blood on his hands in the last war and we'd not even be here---\'

A flash of red light rippled across the table and a wave of warmth settled through him in a pleasurable shiver. Nev relaxed back into his seat. Harry tensed and flicked his wand into his palm.

Fawkes fixed one dark eye on Harry and hopped closer over the plates as the whole hall turned to watch. Harry flicked his wand away. Fawkes trilled, stalking closed and scoffing half a plate of fried tomatoes.

*Those probably aren\'t good for him.*

Fawkes raised his beak, trilled and hopped onto Harry\'s shoulder. A flare of red fire flooded across the table, setting Neville\'s breakfast alight.

Harry dropped into the uncomfortable chair opposite Dumbledore with a wrench and shot the immortal bird a glare as cold shock washed through his veins.

\'Sorry, Harry,\' Dumbledore said. \'I should've known that Fawkes wouldn't have given a sufficient explanation.'

*Fawkes can't talk, so yes, you should've known.*

\'I assume you wished to speak with me, sir?\' Harry inspected the small wood box on the side of the desk.

Runes marked the pattern carved along the edges of the metal bands and lock.

*That looks very well warded.*

'Yes. Yes I did.' Dumbledore straightened the piles of letters, books, and papers on his desk, then produced an elegant, silver bowl full of bright, acid-yellow sweets from within the box and placed it on the desk between them. \'Sherbet lemon? I\'ve had ample opportunity to indulge my fondness for muggle sweets recently.\'

Harry resisted the urge to sigh. *Only Dumbledore would keep something as mundane as sherbet lemons inside such an interesting looking box.*

\'Harry?\' Dumbledore waggled the bowl.

\'Thank you, sir.\' Harry picked one. 'I\'m not usually a huge fan of boiled sweets, but recently I've started to develop a liking for sweet things.'

\'You\'re the first person to accept one since Gilderoy Lockhart. Most of the students seem very suspicious of them, something I find odd given they\'re perfectly prepared to eat Bertie Bott\'s Every Flavour Beans. Perhaps they've some strange idea I drug them with truth potions or compulsions to be good.\' Dumbledore chuckled into his beard. 'If only behaviour management was so easy as that.'

Harry slipped the sherbet lemon into his mouth. A strong, sour-edged sweetness swamped his tongue. *Fleur might like this, but they're probably a bit sour. Gabby would like them a lot.*

'How have you been?' Dumbledore crunched his sherbet lemon and swallowed. 'I see you've abandoned your glasses. An unusual solution to short-sightedness, that. I'd be most keen to learn who did it for you and how you found them?'

Harry smiled. 'How I've been since you... left, sir?' Dumbledore nodded. 'Indeed.'

'As well as could be expected, I suppose, sir. Umbridge

wasn\'t the best headteacher.\'

\'No.\' Dumbledore folded his hands and sighed. 'I imagine she might not have been. Dolores was an unfortunately short- sighted woman. Perhaps she should've attempted the same magic you had cast on your eyes, my boy.'

'At least she was arrested. Even Fudge couldn\'t let her get

away with using veritaserum on students.'

'Arrested?' Dumbledore pushed his half-moon glasses up

his nose. 'Why do you say that, Harry?'

'She used veritaserum on students, myself included, then aurors were seen at Hogwarts and she disappeared. I doubt Fudge would've wanted a public scandal, so he probably had her quietly sentenced, like how he tried to get rid of Sirius.'

'I'm afraid she inexplicably ventured into the Forbidden Forest, Harry. You know as well as I the dangers of the forest. That is not, however, what I brought you here to discuss.'

*Good.* Harry leant back in his chair and frowned when it dug into his spine. *This isn't a good seat.* He pulled his wand out and transfigured it into something more comfortable. *Much better.*

'Excellent, Harry.' Dumbledore peered down at the chair. 'For someone your age, that's a very admirable piece of transfiguration. I daresay Professor McGonagall will be much less concerned about your attendance record once I tell her.'

'I got used to studying alone last year, sir.' Harry shrugged. 'I'd just end up reading other things in most of my lessons.'

Dumbledore nodded. 'Understandable, Harry. I'm inclined to grant you leniency, all things considered, especially as I've not been entirely honest with you. Professor Snape serves a unique and crucial role within the Order of the Phoenix, the group that your parents and godfather joined to help stop Voldemort.\'

\'He\'s a spy. Sirius told me.\'

\'He's possibly the most important member of the Order of the Phoenix,\' Dumbledore murmured. \'The information he divulges to us may be vital in stopping Voldemort for good and I trust him completely.\'

'So he's a good spy.'

Dumbledore steepled his fingers. 'There're very few with the skill to deceive Tom these days, but Professor Snape is one of them. However, I digress. Professor Snape returned from a meeting of Death Eaters to inform me Tom was not only intrigued by your evident increase in skill, but also bemused that you didn't seem to know of the prophecy. I waited for you to ask me about it, but you never came.\'

Harry stifled a bitter chuckle. 'Would you have told me about it if I had?'

'I would've told you as much as you were ready to hear.'

*Presumably that was when you were sure you'd convinced your lamb to walk itself into the slaughterhouse.* Harry smothered a cold, sharp twist of anger. *You've been watching me grow up like a farmer watching his prize bloody pig and imagining bacon.*

'I trusted you to tell me when the time was right,' he said. 'Ah, I see. How, then, did you come to be in the Department

of Mysteries?'

'Mr Weasley died,\' Harry said. 'Sirius agreed it'd be better if

we broke in and destroyed it rather than risk anyone else dying.\'

Dumbledore sighed. 'Your godfather can at times be quite rash. That prophecy was one of the few things that might've been able to lure Tom from hiding before he was ready. Mundungus Fletcher, for all his flaws, was very loyal to me. I helped him out of a tight spot and offered him a second chance, you see.\'

'He warned you about Sirius.'

'He did indeed, Harry. I wasn't sure what to make of it to begin with, but I knew Sirius knew it'd take you to remove the record, so I attempted to plan accordingly.'

'Nobody from the Order came.' A note of accusation slipped into Harry's tone. 'We found Mundungus's body and Sirius called for backup, but you never came.'

Dumbledore flinched, deep creases marring his brow. 'We had to wait. Only a privileged few knew of Tom's plan to attack and I have no doubt they were all told different days. Whoever cast the Dark Mark over London did not do so with Tom's blessing and Professor Snape had to be very careful to not be branded a traitor.

His position as a spy must not be compromised.\'

'Did Snape tell you to delay?' Harry asked. 'I bet he did.' \'He recommended it,\' Dumbledore said. 'We are fortunate

that things worked out. You managed to destroy the prophecy and escape with Sirius, Tom's rage at losing it has cost him one of his more dangerous servants, and with poor Cornelius pushed from office, the Ministry will open its eyes to reality.\'

\'You couldn\'t have planned it better yourself, sir,\' Harry murmured.

\'I must know, Harry, what happened to the prophecy. Sirius told me that you retrieved it and broke it, but he didn't say whether you heard it or not.\'

'It got destroyed, but I *did* hear some of it.'

*Let's see you explain your interpretation, Dumbledore.* Harry bit back a thin smile. *How will you wrap up sending me to die so that it sounds sweet and seemly?*

Dumbledore slipped his pale wand out and waved it at the cabinet to his left. \'This is a pensieve. A very useful tool. One can store any number of thoughts and memories within it for future review. Among my many recollections here is the night that prophecy was made.\'

*Was it just him that witnessed it?* Harry studied Dumbledore's face. *Did he even tell Voldemort about it and give my parents the blood magic they cast to protect me.*

'How did Voldemort learn of it if *you* witnessed it?\'

'I heard it above the bar in the Hog\'s Head after going to meet an applicant for the post of Divination Professor.\' Dumbledore studied the polished surface of the desk between his hands. \'Unfortunately, a young Death Eater overheard the first part before I cast a silencing ward and rushed off to inform his master.'

\'Who?\'

'Does it matter, Harry?' Dumbledore murmured. 'The past cannot be changed.'

'Whoever passed on those words condemned my parents to die.' Harry met Dumbledore's gaze. 'And from what Bellatrix said, it wasn't just my family that was targeted as a result.'

'I can assure you that the wizard in question has suffered for it every day since.' Dumbledore closed his eyes. 'Perhaps I *should* tell you, Harry. It might help you understand things are not always so simple as they seem. Yes, I think that would be wise of me.'

*But if my reaction doesn't please him, he might not spill the*

*beans on the prophecy and give me some clue of what he wants.* Harry weighed up his options. *My parents are long dead. No amount of wishing will bring them back. Fleur's more important.*

'After the prophecy, professor.'

'Quite right, Harry.\' Dumbledore smiled and nodded his head. 'The prophecy, the future, is far more pressing than the past.' He pulled a single strand of silver, hooked on the tip of his wand, out of the basin. \'There's no need to experience it in its entirety. Hearing the words will suffice.\'

*All of it? Or will you try to deceive me the same way I tricked Voldemort?*

Professor Trelawney\'s hoarse, rasping voice echoed from the glowing silver strand at the tip of Dumbledore\'s wand, reciting the full prophecy.

\'You see, Harry, the mistake that Voldemort made,' Dumbledore said. 'In his fear and hubris, he attempted to fulfil the terms of the prophecy as he knew them, and, to his cost, was proved mistaken. That he doesn't yet know the full prophecy and a way by which he can safely defeat you is one of our greatest advantages.\'

'That doesn\'t help *me* defeat *him*, professor,\' Harry said. 'He knows far more magic and is much stronger than I am. How am *I* supposed to defeat *him*?'

A small smile spread across Dumbledore's lips and a bright twinkle appeared in his eyes. \'There're many mysterious forces in this world. Magic is only one of them. In the Department of Mysteries lies a door that is kept locked at all times, for the force behind it is deemed too complex to understand and too powerful to study by Unspeakables that investigate time, death, and many other equally terrible things.\'

*It'd better not be love*. *If he tells me the room is full of love,*

*I'll strangle him with his own beard.*

\'Within that room is contained the most powerful force we

know.\' A touch of passion coloured Dumbledore's tone. 'Love.'

Harry\'s hands twitched toward the tip of Albus Dumbledore\'s impressive white beard. *Let me guess, I should love all the shallow, selfish people who wanted me to give everything for them, but never gave anything back to me. I should die for their fleeting affection.*

'Voldemort never knew love,' Dumbledore murmured. 'He does not, *can* not, understand it, and I believe that will prove his undoing. He is a master of many magics, some that even I myself remain a novice in, but he underestimates the role of love in life. It has nearly cost him everything once before already.'

'I don\'t understand, sir.' Harry allowed himself a grin. 'I don't think professing my love for him will stop him.'

\'Your mother\'s love has protected you to this day,\' Dumbledore said. \'Your own ability to love will prove to be Tom's downfall.\' He fixed Harry with a gentle, but penetrating look. \'You must trust me, Harry. I have, in my absence from Hogwarts, been collecting and studying memories of Tom Riddle, the boy who became Lord Voldemort, and learnt a great deal of his character. Aside from once again having to recruit a new Defence Professor, I will spend my summer trying to make sure you receive everything you need to bring about Tom's defeat.'

*Presumably he wants to destroy the horcruxes over the summer so when I return here, he can send me off to die and pat himself on the back for a job well done.*

'Thank you, sir.'

\'Now.\' A gleam of pride entered Dumbledore's eyes. \'I've

understood from your teachers that your performances have

improved dramatically when you *do* attend your lessons. Even Professor Snape admitted you might be demonstrating the hard work and maturity required to temper talent into something more.\'

'How unexpectedly kind of him.' Harry's grin stretched a little wider. 'Did it cause him physical pain to say it?'

'Professor Snape is, among other things, a very fine judge of character. When he was a young student here, Severus Snape was a clever and committed pupil in Slytherin House, one who was even brave enough to befriend a muggle-born girl in Gryffindor, but, thanks in part to the efforts of a handful of marauding Gryffindors, he was eventually driven to fall in with some less reputable house mates.' Dumbledore rested his palms on the desk. 'From there he was led down a path of mistakes that would lead him to a cold, wet night at the Hog\'s Head and making a decision that betrayed the one person he cared about most. He has never forgiven himself for it.

Indeed, I don't think he ever will.'

*Snape was the one who told Voldemort.* A ball of ice closed about Harry's heart. *And he dared to mock me about my parents after he got them killed.*

'I believe he's earnt the right to try and make amends.' Dumbledore adjusted the position of his bowl of sherbet lemons by a fraction. 'He's turned his back on Tom at no small risk to himself and for no reward. Professor Snape is a very different person to the misled young man he once was.'

*I don't care.* Harry forced the twisting, thrashing coils of ice to still, forcing the chill deep down and honing it into a razor sharp calm. *For eleven years I drowned alone in the dark because of him. Not only has he not managed so much as an apology, he taunted me about the parents he stole.*

'I must ask that you promise not to add to Severus\'s woes, Harry.' Dumbledore sighed. 'I tell you this secret of his in the closest confidence. He bears a great weight of responsibility on his shoulders, one we can\'t afford to add to by helping him drown himself with guilt. I understand it will be hard for you, but sometimes what is necessary *is* hard.'

\'It\'s ok, Professor Dumbledore.' Harry plastered a neutral look across his face. \'I understand. He\'ll have the second chance he deserves.\'

# The Flame and the Flower

Her fingers curled into cotton sheets. Harry's hands tangled in her hair. His palm slid across the hot skin of her hip and his lips whispered down her neck. Heat pooled between Fleur's thighs, need coiling within her.

A loud thud tore through Harry's murmurs.

Fleur's eyes snapped open. A soft, warm damp lingered between her legs as the cotton covers brushed across her stiff nipples and a faint, wanton whisper curled within.

'Fleur!' Gabby banged her fist on the door. 'Get up!'

*One day, I will kill her.* Fleur untangled herself from the covers, tugging off her top and her shorts, and tossing them away. Cold air washed the mood from her. *That was a good dream.*

'Fleur! Come---'

'Bang on my door *one* more time, Gabrielle, and I will tell Maman who cut the photos of Harry out of the English paper and uses them to bookmark *certain* pages in her steamiest romance novels!'

A squeak echoed from the hall.

Fleur pulled on a matching set of underwear and shook her hair out, then grabbed her wand and waved it at the door. '*Now,* you can come in.'

Gabby edged in, pink-faced. 'Er, hi Fleur.'

'In.' Fleur beckoned with her wand, then tugged her wardrobe open and rummaged for a modest blouse.

*Too thin. Too thin. Too low-cut. Too thin.* Fleur sighed and dug out an older one. *Not the nicest, but at least I'll be warm and nobody can stare down my top.*

'Are you mad?' Gabby sidled in and shut the door behind her, colour rising on her cheeks. 'Sorry, Fleur. It's -- er -- it's not *just* him. I mean---\'

'I'm not mad. I can't exactly fault your taste.' Fleur pulled on the blouse and a pair of dark trousers. 'Although I willbe *very* mad if you do anything more than hoard a few photos from the paper and clutch them while *reading*.'

A nervous giggle slipped through Gabby's lips. 'Speaking of Harry, when am I coming with you to Britain?'

Fleur thrust her wand into her pocket and glanced at her clock. 'In a few days. Unlike you, I'm going to spend the summer with the real thing and not a stack of erotica loosely dressed as romance.'

*And I'm going to enjoy it.* Her heart squirmed. *All that time and*

*it's going to be just the two of us.*

'The romance is good!' Gabby crossed her arms. '*You* gave

them to me.'

'I did not. I *let* you take them, because I didn't want Maman's book collection in my room.' Fleur smirked and wiggled two fingers at Gabby. 'And we both know *why* you took them, my sweet, pure, baby sister.'

She flushed pink. 'As if you were any better, Fleur. *I'm* not the one who bookmarked the pages to begin with.' Gabby grinned. 'Veela are sexual creatures, like sirens. It's in our nature.'

Fleur laughed. 'No we aren't and you know it, little chick.' She checked the clock again. 'Now, shoo, Gabby, I must apparate to work.'

She pictured the plain, stone walls and floor of the employees'

entrance, then stepped onto the smooth marble floor.

A be-suited goblin strode from the far side of the room. 'Right on time, Miss Delacour.' He checked a gleaming, silver pocket watch. 'With thirty seconds to spare, in fact.' The goblin snapped it shut and tucked it away. 'I am Agdol. You're joining my team.'

Fleur nodded. 'That's what I was told in the letter.'

Agdol squinted at her. 'I will say this only once. Here. Where there's nobody else to hear. Gringotts doesn't tolerate anything that harms its reputation. That list includes but isn't limited to, theft, sexual liaisons, fraud, incompetence, violence, or discourteous behaviour. If you find yourself on the receiving end or come across any such behaviour, bring it straight to me.' He fiddled with his pocket watch. 'In your case in particular, Miss Delacour, I would like to assure you any unwanted -- er -- advances, will not be tolerated. A fractious, distracted team is an inefficient one.'

She smiled. 'I can take care of myself, but thank you.' 'Excellent. Stick to the rules, meet expectations, and we'll be

just fine.' Agdol ran his fingers through iron-grey hair. 'Follow me,

Miss Delacour.'

Fleur followed Agdol past bare, grey walls and numerous offices overflowing with paper to a steep staircase.

'You won't find yourself here.' Agdol waved a hand back at the offices. 'These lower offices are for goblins just starting out at the bank. We have a spot downstairs for our curse-breakers to work safely and up there is where we are.'

Agdol laboured up the small steps. Sweat trickled from beneath his grey hair and down to his jaw.

Fleur drifted up after him. *I better be left alone to do my work, I just want to do what I have to do here, then be with Harry.*

Agdol staggered down a corridor into another small office. 'This is us. The Department for the Assessment and Appraisal of Mid-level Magical Objects from Southern Europe and Northern Africa.'

'A mouthful,' Fleur murmured.

'But precisely accurate.' Agdol plucked a roll of paper out of a small slot in the wall and pointed across at an empty desk. 'That is you, Miss Delacour. We assign a number of magical objects to each member of the team depending on their specialty, but there's no strict procedure. This is a team, if you're unsure and you wish for a second opinion, ask another member of the team.'

Fleur peered around at mounds of paper, stacks of crates,

and polished wooden desks. 'Who else is in the team?'

Agdol's roll of paper slipped back to his side. 'Unfortunately, Miss Delacour. It is just the two of us for now. There was an unfortunate incident with a cursed spoon several months back. The experience was traumatic and the fault was with Gringotts' assignment procedure, so they've been offered a long, paid holiday as fair compensation.'

Fleur hid a smile. *Good. Just me, then.*

Agdol hurried toward her desk. 'It's pretty simple stuff, especially for someone with a reputation such as yours...' He tapped his roll of papers on his palm. 'I do wonder *why* you applied here, Miss Delacour. This position is comfortable enough, but you could've easily become a curse-breaker if you'd applied there.'

'There's a good chance I won't be staying in the country long enough to complete the course.' Fleur poked about in the drawers of her desk, turning up a blunt pencil and a chewed pen lid.

'Ah.' Agdol shuffled his feet. 'That does make sense.

Uncertain times at the moment. Still, you're quite safe at Gringotts.' A small grin spread across his lips. 'I'm sure your government wouldn't want to lose *another* war.'

'I think we have enough wars right now.' Fleur dropped into

her chair.

'Quite so. Wars are bad for business.' Agdol plucked the white cloth off the top of a stack of crates. 'For now, Miss Delacour, just check over the contents of one of these crates a day. Break down what sort of enchantments you can detect, fill in a form for each object, then, if there's anything complex or possibly dangerous, send them to the curse-breakers.' Agdol pointed his role of paper at a stack of forms. 'Fill in one of those, then take it and the object downstairs. From there, it's their problem, not ours.'

Fleur glanced into the crate. An odd assortment of objects languished on the cheap, pale wood. She pulled her wand out and levitated a bronze candlestick onto her desk.

Agdol nodded. 'Excellent start. The last new employee used his bare hand.' A small grin spread across the goblin's lips. 'He is enjoying a lovely all expenses holiday courtesy of Gringotts because there shouldn't've been a top-tier magical object in the crate, but

that's not going to regrow his hand.' He glanced into the crate. 'I shall leave you to it, Miss Delacour.'

Fleur pursed her lips, then traced her wand over the candle.

A faint sheen of magic sat upon the metal like gloss.

She sighed, then tossed it back into the crate. 'An anti-dust charm.' Fleur tugged a form over and summoned a quill and ink from somewhere behind the stack of crates.

Four pages of boxes and questions waited in stark black and white. Fleur etched a series of crosses and short answers in, flicking through the pages. She turned to the last and found a single, large box.

'List and describe the enchantments upon the object.' Fleur put her quill down. 'Non.' She wove her magic into the quill, watching as it rose into the air, dipped itself into the bottle of ink, then began to write. 'Much better.'

She glanced at the crate label. *Crate XVII. Hadrumentum.*

'This is going to be boring.' Fleur levitated a wooden comb

out of the crate.

A faint, ancient magic saturated the teeth, like the weight of the quiet in a muggle church.

'The things I endure for you, monCœur.' She dropped the

comb back into the box.

She poked around the crate with her wand tip until a faint, quiet sensation of sharpness slid down her spine. Fleur raised out a small, bronze armlet emblazoned with faded thunderclouds.

*Interesting.* She teased her magic into the enchantment.

air.

Tiny teeth formed from the smooth metal and gnashed the

'Lovely.' Fleur tugged one of the curse-breaker forms off the

top of the stack and a clump of paper as thick as her finger joined with a thick, iron clasp thudded onto her desk. 'Non. That is absolutely *not* happening.' She stripped the sharp threads of magic out from the rest and tossed the armlet back into the box. 'Much better.'

Agdol bustled out of his office with a low growl. 'What did you just do, Miss Delacour?'

Fleur swivelled round. 'Am I not allowed to disenchant

things?'

Agdol sputtered. 'You're not an *official curse-breaker*. If it's

done by you, then we can't sell it as safe because one of our proper

curse-breakers hasn't looked at it.'

She pursed her lips. 'So give me the official title.'

'It's a *four year course*.' Agdol's small dark eyes fixed on the armlet. 'There's an *exam* at the end.' He touched a long, thin finger to it, and made a low rumbling sound. 'Still, I can't tell you even stripped anything from this. There's no damage to the other enchantments.'

Fleur tilted her chin upward. 'Of course there's no *damage*.'

Agdol glanced from her, to the crate, then back again. 'I very

much dislike breaking with proper procedures, Miss Delacour. However, I saw your credentials when you applied and now I've seen you do something better than half the curse-breakers downstairs can.' He crooked his finger. 'I am not in a position to judge, though, so come with me.'

Fleur trailed him down the corridor, then down the stairs into a dark, stone hall lit by a hundred bright, glowing, glass lamps.

Agdol cleared his throat and muttered to the goblin in the office beside the door. Fleur watched their heated, hissed conversation in Gobbledegook out of the corner of her eye. The curse-breakers put down their wands and work one by one to stare at her save for a handful around a small, stone jar.

Agdol stepped out of the office. 'This is Grakgin. He oversees the curse-breakers here. He has *grudgingly* allowed you to be tested.'

Grakgin shot Fleur a glower. 'Weasley!'

A red-headed curse-breaker glanced up from the stone jar.

'What is it, boss?'

'Come up here into my office.' Grakgin ushered them all in. 'Bring that jar!'

The red-head wrapped the jar up in a thick white sheet and stomped across, cradling it to his chest. He glanced at Fleur and set the jar on the desk. 'Pleased to meet you. I'm Bill Weasley, vice-head curse-breaker.' He grinned and offered her a calloused hand. 'Miss or Mrs?'

'Fleur Delacour.' She eyed the hand. 'I don't go for that.'

'Miss Delacour,' Grakgin snapped. 'Agdol says you have the credentials to be a curse-breaker, stripped the enchantments off one of our pieces like an expert, but decided you wanted to sit behind a desk with a feather instead?'

'I might not be in the country for long enough to complete the course.' Fleur shot Bill Weasley a look. 'I'm only working in this branch of Gringotts because my boyfriend is British.'

Grakgin whipped the white cover off the stone jar to reveal a

worn, stone face. 'This is a canopic jar, Miss Delacour. Empty. Collectors would pay very well for it, but only if it doesn't do this.' He poked it with his finger.

The jar's stone face stretched open and a thin, piercing

shriek filled the office.

Fleur winced. 'Not a good alarm clock.'

Bill snorted. 'No.' He glanced at Grakgin. 'Unfortunately, the enchantment is woven into the ones that keep it sealed and from degrading. I can't tell them apart.'

'Do your best.' Grakgin crossed his arms. 'If you do well, I'll allow you to work as a curse-breaker on the objects your department is cleared to handle.'

*Well, I suppose that will save me having to come down here.* She glanced through the window and all the curse-breakers started and began staring hard at their desks. *Which is definitely a good thing.*

Fleur pulled out her wand and closed her eyes. Old, still, stubbornness saturated the cold stone like gnarled fingers clutching at life. Beneath it, little threads of magic wriggled like worms escaping soaked dirt. She picked through them, tugging at each one until she found a coil of childish fear, a baby's cry, petrified in stone. Fleur wove her magic through the enchantments, then plucked it out like a hair from her head.

'Done,' she said.

Bill choked. 'What?!'

Grakgin poked the jar. He blinked, then pressed a finger to it. 'Excellent work. I can't even tell there was something there.' He rummaged through the papers on his desk. 'Fleur Isabelle Delacour. I will finish this form, then send it through the proper channels. Sign it when you get it. Keep it somewhere safe. You're an associate curse- breaker on a six month probation. Weasley will check on you to make sure you're getting on ok.'

Bill's face brightened and Fleur felt his gaze sweep over

her.

He grimaced and tugged his eyes back up to hers. 'Sorry,' he

said. 'You're full veela or something, aren't you?' She crossed her arms. 'Yes.'

He nodded. 'Wondered why it was so hard to keep my eyes off you. Not felt a tug like that since we were in that tomb in Sardinia. Big old gold statue of Astarte in there. Half the team got caught in its compulsion, if I hadn't been able to drag myself free to destroy it, they'd've killed each other.'

*Well, at least he can think for himself.* Fleur slipped her wand away and stepped toward the door. *A good thing he's the one keeping an eye on me and not one of those other idiots.*

'When I swing by and make sure you're not up to anything suspicious, I'll bring something interesting for us to play with,' Bill called after her. 'Makes it more fun than just paperwork!'

# O.W.L. in a Day's Work

Harry crept down the stairs into the common room, one eye on the back of Katie's head as he slipped through the huddles of students until he was right behind her sofa.

\'It\'s exam day!\' he cried, shaking Katie\'s shoulders.

Nev glanced up from where he clutched his transfiguration

book.

Katie twisted 'round with a growl. \'Stop shaking me. I don\'t

even *have* exams today.\'

\'Oh, that\'s right.' Harry gave her a few more shakes and a grin. 'You\'re in the in-between year, so you only have pretend tests.\'

\'Yes.\' Katie waved her fist under his nose. 'So *stop*, before I

hit you.\'

Harry swung himself over the back of the sofa and slumped

across the other half. Katie squirmed and dropped her bare feet into his lap, her red toenails gleaming in the light of the fire.

\'Aren\'t you going to do any last minute revision?\' Katie

pointed at Nev. 'He's been cramming since about 4am.'

Harry raised an eyebrow.

\'Of course you're not.\' She sighed. 'It\'s Potions, Transfiguration, and Defence today, you don\'t need to revise for any of your exams, let alone the last two.\'

\'Potions is later in the week,\' Harry said. \'And that\'s not even close to being true, I couldn\'t confidently take anything except

Charms, Transfiguration, and Defence without revision, though I might be able to have a stab at Arithmancy and Runes if I were completely unconcerned about my OWLs.\'

*And Potions means Snape, who's even more of a thorn in*

*my side now than he was in first year.*

\'You\'re not getting into the spirit of things, Harry,\' Katie complained. \'I was *frantic* in my OWL year. Not only were you doing your best to die in some stupid tournament, but Mad-Eye Moody taught us nothing to do with the exam. Angelina had to slip me alcohol before our Defence exam to calm me down.\'

\'Well there\'s no tournament this year.\' Harry patted her feet. \'There, there. And *I\'m* not an alcoholic, so that wouldn't work on me anyway.\'

Katie shivered and wriggled her toes against his palm, then

pouted. \'Neither am I.'

\'Angelina --- and Alicia, if she ever speaks to me again ---

would disagree.\'

Katie\'s face fell. \'I\'m sorry about her.\' She glanced at Nev and scooted closer. 'She\'s not happy about how close we are after that article.\'

Harry scowled. \'Does she still think it\'s true?\'

\'No. Don't worry about it.\' Katie squirmed. 'I'll deal with it.'

\'As long as you\'re okay with it, then I\'ll let it be.'

Katie beamed. \'Thanks, Harry. It'd make everything terribly

awkward if you waded in.\'

\'So what exams *do* you have?\' Harry asked.

\'I\'ve already taken most of them, higher years go first. Just Charms left and that\'s one of my best subjects.\'

A twist of guilt lanced through his stomach. \'Sorry. I

should've known, really, I've been caught up in everything else.'

\'That\'s alright.\' Katie stretched and yawned, pushing her legs over his lap and bunching her skirt on his thigh. \'I know you must have a good reason for being distant and they went well enough I didn\'t need a shoulder to cry on.\'

'You're giving me a bit of a show, Katie dearest.' Harry reached out and tugged the hem of Katie's skirt down to her knees.

'What a gentleman.' She fluttered her eyelashes. 'That's why it's you I come crying to.'

'You wouldn't've come to cry on me.'

\'I definitely would've.\' Katie smoothed her skirt out and kicked her feet. \'You wouldn\'t've known what to do and might've bought me chocolate or even let me keep your Firebolt.\'

\'So shallow.\' Harry feigned a deep sigh. 'It's really no wonder you've not managed to find a boyfriend all year.'

*I remember how you crying on me feels.* Harry's fingers slipped to his shoulder, where the memory of her warm tears had soaked into his robes.

\'Hush,\' Katie admonished, bending forward. 'Some of us don't fall head over heels for the first sexy French girl we see,' she whispered.

Harry poked her on the nose. 'So if you don\'t have exams and you\'re clearly not working, why\'re you up and down here so early on a Saturday?\'

'I wanted to wish you luck, of course.\' Katie beamed. \'Just

because you forgot to wish me luck doesn\'t mean I\'ll forget as well.\'

\'Well, I wish you luck with your Charms exam,\' Harry

replied.

\'I won\'t need it. Watch.'

She pulled her wand out of her robes and pointed it across

at the table in the corner where Ron, Dean and Seamus had buried their faces in a huge stack of Hermione's notes. Katie charmed the edging of Ron\'s robes from red and gold to a bright shade of orange.

Ron squinted at his robes, then grinned and gave her a

crooked thumbs up. \'Chudley colours!' \'Impressive.'

\'Thanks.\' She laughed. \'Ron seems to appreciate it. I was expecting an explosion.\'

\'He\'s grown up a bit,\' Harry said. \'If you\'d done that to

Hermione, we\'d've had a duel on our hands.\'

\'She\'s not here. Nobody's seen her since yesterday.

Apparently she got so afraid of failing she nearly had a breakdown.'

\'It\'s probably for the best,\' Harry said. \'She\'d be furious if she saw that they\'d taken her notes out of their proper order.\'

Katie shrugged. 'That girl's wound too tight. She needs some proper hobbies and a boyfriend.'

'Don't say that where she can hear you.'

She snorted. 'What's she going to do, throw a book at me?' 'She *is* pretty good at magic.' Harry chuckled. 'But mostly

because she can hit a pretty high volume when she gets pissed off

and I like the quiet.'

\'It\'s almost time for you to go. If you get there early enough for a practical exam, they\'ll let you go first and get it out the way.\'

\'What about being drunk?\' Harry teased. \'Do they mind

that?\'

\'I wouldn\'t know.\' Katie smiled. \'I was only confident.\'

\'I suppose I\'d better go.\' Harry stared at the pair of bare feet

still in his lap. 'If *someone* will let me.'

\'Oops.\' Katie giggled. \'Sorry. You make a good foot rest.\'

\'Thanks.\' Harry tapped his finger on Katie's polished toe nails. 'So?'

\'Right.\' Katie flushed and curled up on the far side of the

sofa. 'Bye then.'

\'Coming, Nev?\' Harry asked.

\'Don\'t have much of a choice, do I?\' Nev stuck his head out from behind his book. 'And it's better than watching you two on the sofa.'

Harry rolled his eyes. 'We weren't being *that* distracting.'

Katie's cheeks turned a little pink. 'Shut up, Longbottom, or you'll have to take your Transfiguration exam from the hospital wing.'

Harry laughed. 'He might prefer that. That way, when he faints, they'll have a bed for him right there.'

\'Well, we both know who\'s going to come first in most of these exams,\' Nev joked.

\'Hermione.\' They both laughed and headed out of the tower toward the exam room.

\'What do you reckon the practical will be on?\' Nev asked.

\'Probably a couple of the spells we've learnt this year.

They\'re the harder ones, but I\'ve heard you can go above and beyond the material to earn extra credit.\'

\'I think I\'ll just stick to the spells they suggest,\' Nev said.

\'I won\'t hold it against you.\' Harry grinned. \'Not unless you get the Doubling Charm wrong again and sabotage the whole exam.\'

Nev swallowed and fingered his wand.

\'Don\'t worry about it, Nev.\' Harry clapped him on the shoulder. \'You\'ll do fine.\'

\'Gran has a NEWT level in Transfiguration,\' Nev muttered. \'She\'d be awfully disappointed if I didn\'t at least pass my OWL.\'

\'You\'ll pass,\' Harry told him, pushing the door to the exam room open. \'Besides, you\'re not your Gran, you\'ve got a much better taste in hats.'

\'You\'re early,\' a stern-looking witch snapped. \'And quite relaxed to be taking such an important

examination.\' A portly wizard commented. \'You can go first, if you

like?\'

\'Why not.\' Harry nudged Nev forward.

\'Over here then, Mr Potter,\' the stern-looking witch instructed.

Harry abandoned Nev to the portly wizard with a wave and a smile, striding across the floor to his examiner. *Nev's probably quite happy I got the witch, she looks like how Nev describes his Gran.*

\'The first thing I would like you to do is vanish this.\' The witch placed a large block of wood on the desk in front of her.

\'Evanesco,\' Harry murmured, flicking his wand from its holster to draw the wand motion for the spell in the air.

The wooden block faded away.

\'Good.\' Her tone relaxed a little. \'Now, I'd like you to use whatever method you prefer to create another desk such as this one.\' She tapped the desk in front of her with one, long-nailed finger.

*Just make another desk? Okay.* Harry brought forth a perfect copy of the desk, conjuring it from the air just as he did his butterflies. *Oh, she probably meant the doubling charm... Oops.*

\'Very good, Mr Potter,\' she breathed. \'Is there anything you\'d like to try for extra credit? If you should fail, it will have no bearing on the grade you have already obtained at this point.\'

\'I don\'t see why not.\' Harry shrugged and glanced at his conjured writing desk. A swirl and flick of his ebony wand and the writing desk shivered into the form of a large, glossy-feathered raven.

The witch broke into a smile and clapped her hands

together, startling Nev who'd just conjured a lopsided desk of his

own. \'Is there any reason you chose to do that particular piece of magic, Mr Potter?\'

Harry grinned. \'They seemed similar to me.'

\'An outstanding piece of Transfiguration, especially for an OWL student.\' The witch poked the raven with the tip of her wand. The bird hopped onto the desk and cawed, snapping its beak at the assault. \'Full marks, I think, Mr Potter, and that is all. If you want to wait for your friend, please do so outside.\'

Somewhere on the other side of the room, Nev sighed.

Harry counted the stones in the wall. *I wonder how Fleur's day at work is going.* He imagined her pouting at some old, dust- covered object, wand in one hand, hot chocolate in the other, and chuckled. *She's probably bored out of her mind.*

Nev stumbled out.

\'That wasn\'t so bad,\' Harry said.

\'You\'ve ruined the exam for everyone else,\' Nev said. \'I managed to successfully cast the doubling charm on the desk and the wizard told me I\'d done well, but it wasn\'t quite a raven.\'

\'Well it *wasn\'t,* but it sounds like you did well.\'

\'I think I passed, but my desk had less detail in the grain and the back legs were a bit shorter than they should have been.\'

\'Still a pass,\' Harry reckoned. \'Might not be an outstanding, but at least an acceptable or an exceeds.\'

\'That\'s true,\' Nev\'s face brightened. 'Perhaps Gran will be

pleased.\'

\'She won\'t notice anything after seeing your marks for Herbology and Defence.\' Harry laughed. \'The only way you\'re not ending up the top student for Herbology is if Hannah distracts you midway through the practical.\'

\'They won\'t let me do the practical on my own plant,\' Nev

replied.

\'Wrong *Hannah*, Nev. I meant the pretty blond one that

doesn\'t shoot goo at people when they get too close.\' He cocked his

head. 'Or at least I don't *think* she does.'

\'Oh.\' Nev flushed scarlet. \'Do you think we can do our Defence practical early too?\'

\'Worth a try,\' Harry said.

Hermione brushed past them halfway along the corridor, her back stiff as a stone, her fingers clutched to her chest, muttering beneath her breath.

\'Do you think she\'ll outdo you?\' Neville asked.

\'Not in the practical,\' Harry said. \'But she\'ll do better in the written part. We won\'t be able to tell who did best anyway, since it\'s likely we\'ll end up with the same grade.\'

\'Confident much?\'

\'It\'s one of my best subjects. I\'ll get an outstanding, just like we both will in Defence.\'

They continued along the corridor, fighting against the flow of students trying to get to the Transfiguration exam.

\'Did you leave the raven in there?\' Nev asked.

\'Yes.\' Harry chuckled.

\'Hermione\'s going to take it as a challenge,\' Nev muttered. \'If she wants to. I\'m more worried about it escaping and

flying off with a first year. My reputation is bad enough already.\'

\'Maybe it will take Mini-Creevey.\' Nev pushed open the door to the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom. \'I heard he\'s almost as annoying as his brother.\'

Harry threw a look around the desks and benches. \'Room\'s

empty.'

\'I guess we won\'t be taking this one early.' Nev peered into

Umbridge's office and whistled. 'Whatever spell did this isn't

something I want to be on the wrong end of.'

The door behind them creaked open and a quartet of old wizards strolled in, carrying an odd assortment of items. Harry spied egg cups, a whole box of crystal balls, and a rather disgruntled iguana.

\'I think we\'re late, Tofty,\' the foremost complained.

\'We\'re on time,\' the second quavered in a paper-thin voice. \'These young men are simply early.\'

\'Early? Are they allowed to be early?\'

\'There\'s no rules against it,\' the youngest of the four, who was not a day under sixty, said. \'If I help Phoebus unpack, then Tofty can get started with Mr Potter, and you can examine his young friend.\'

Nev scowled.

\'A splendid idea.\' The eldest adjusted his glasses and lifted the iguana out of the box. \'Come on then, Mr Potter.\' The old examiner meandered past a few desks and placed the iguana down. \'I\'m Professor Tofty and this is Kanoni. He\'s older than two of my colleagues and has overseen just as many exams as I have, not that his judgement will have any impact on your grade.\' Tofty chuckled. \'He gets lonely when I leave the office for long periods of time, so I have to take him with me or he causes trouble.\'

\'It\'s nice to meet you both.\'

*Is there a particular age at which wizards start to go a little*

*peculiar?*

\'Well then.\' Professor Tofty smiled and adjusted his glasses.

\'We might as well get started.\' He rummaged around in the pockets of his robes to retrieve a long list of names. \'Could you name and perform the spell you would use to defeat a boggart, Mr Potter?\'

\'The Boggart-Banishing spell,\' Harry answered.

*But Fiendfyre works pretty well, too, and it's much more*

*satisfying.*

\'And to demonstrate?\' Tofty twitched toward the edge of his

chair.

\'Riddikulus.\' Harry flicked his wand out and demonstrated

the motion.

\'Good.\' Tofty leant back to make a few notes on his paper with a bent-feathered quill. \'Now I\'d like you to cast the Impedimenta jinx and its counter for me.\'

The iguana crept behind Tofty.

\'He\'s not going to do it to you, Kanoni.\' Tofty sighed. \'I had one student hit him with the Levitating charm a few years back, he\'s been nervous around wands ever since.\'

Harry cast both the Impedimenta jinx and its counter

silently.

\'Excellent,\' Professor Tofty squeaked. \'Non-verbal spells

aren\'t meant to be covered until NEWT level.\' He scratched several

lines of illegible scrawl across his piece of paper. \'Shield charm next.'

Harry summoned a bright, silver shield that gave off a faint, bell-toned shimmer.

\'Oh my,\' Tofty said. \'That\'s quite extraordinary.\'

The other examiners stared across the room at him.

\'Is there anything you\'d like to try for extra credit? It won\'t harm your grade if you fail.\'

\'There is.' He raised his wand and pointed the ebony tip toward a clear part of the classroom. He closed his eyes and remembered the first time Fleur had kissed him in the summer sun, letting a warm glow flood through him.

The Anzu burst from his wand in an eruption of brilliant silver. It hovered in the air, flexing its wings and peering at the room\'s occupants, then threw its head back to give a soft echoing cry and vanished.

\'Outstanding!\' Tofty cried. \'Really?\' Harry asked.

\'Well.\' Professor Tofty flapped his hands. \'I didn\'t mean it quite like *that*, but just between us, my boy, it\'s more than likely.\'

\'Thank you, professor.'

Harry watched Nev breeze through his exam, then circled

away from the exam room. 'That went pretty well.'

'You showed off again.' Nev rolled his eyes. 'Not so bad as the raven, though.'

They ran into the back of a huddle of green and silver lined

robes.

*unfair*.'

'That went so badly,' Pansy Parkinson whined. 'It's so

Malfoy sighed. 'It wasn\'t that hard, Pansy,' he drawled. 'I\'m

sure it didn\'t help that the giant raven stole your wand at the start, but that\'s not going to count against you. You completed all the tasks, so you got at least an acceptable.\'

\'But I didn\'t manage to do anything for the extra credit,\' Pansy moaned.

\'You don\'t even want to take the subject for NEWTs,\' Malfoy

said.

\'You remembered!'

\'It was hard not to when I get told every lesson.'

\'You dislike some subjects too,\' Pansy sniped. \'I know how

you feel about Care for Magical Creatures; you\'re still scared of Hippogriffs.\'

Harry stifled a laugh, then the acorn on his necklace flared hot and he ducked away into a quiet corridor. 'I'm off to the library, Nev. I've got something I want to have a look at in the section I'm not supposed to be in. I'll catch you later.'

*now?*

*Gabby must be able to come and sort out the wards, but why*

\'I\'ll tell Katie,\' Nev said. \'So she doesn\'t set up camp in the

common room waiting for you to tell her how your exams went.\'

\'Thanks.'

\'See you later, mate.' Nev drifted off.

Harry stepped into the nearest empty classroom, then shut the door behind him and sealed it with a flick of his wand. 'Azure.'

Fleur's face shimmered into view. A strained, indulgent smile hovered on her lips. \'Gabby\'s being difficult. She wants to talk to you before she casts the Fidelius for us and apparently it *has* to be now.\'

too.\'

\'I\'m coming.\' Harry switched to French. \'I can bring Sirius,

\'Sirius Black?\' Fleur's eyes softened. 'Are you finally going to

tell someone about us?'

\'He can be trusted and we need somewhere secret so he can tell us what\'s happening with the Order of the Phoenix.\' Harry grinned. \'If nothing else, we can trade him to Gabby as a pet in return for performing the charm.'

'She would say no. She wants to talk to you. *Only you.*'Fleur's face tightened. 'I love my little sister, monCœur, so be nice, even if she's difficult, which she will be.'

'I will be,' Harry promised. 'I like Gabby.'

'I know you like Gabby.' Fleur shot him a playful glare. 'And she likes you. I probably shouldn't leave you two alone together.'

'I'll be with you soon.' Harry gave her a wave, then let the mirror shrink back into the acorn pendant and hurried toward the Chamber of Secrets.

*I'll have to apparate to Grimmauld Place.* He disillusioned himself and took the quick way, slipping through groups of students, then diverting into Myrtle's bathroom.

\'Myrtle,\' Harry greeted, pausing to peer into the open cubicles. \'How have you been?\'

*She was acting kind of strange a few weeks back.*

\'Harry.\' She floated across to him. 'Professor Dumbledore

was here earlier.\'

\'He was?\' Harry tensed and peered 'round the bathroom. 'Did he do anything?'

\'He asked if anyone had been in here.\' Myrtle fretted and bobbed in the air. \'I said no, of course, and that seemed to please him.\'

\'Did he cast any magic while he was here?\' Harry asked.

\'No.\' Myrtle shook her head. \'He just asked me some questions. Is everything ok?\'

\'Everything\'s fine, Myrtle.\' Harry smiled. \'Don\'t worry.

Dumbledore\'s just concerned about anyone going down there, only he can\'t actually enter like I can, so he doesn\'t know for sure that it\'s safe.\'

*Not that it is safe*. *Voldemort could apparate in whenever he wants. It\'s a good thing there\'s no reason for him to come to Hogwarts yet.*

'That's good.' Myrtle's silver form dimmed until Harry struggled to see her frown. 'He's never trusted you. Not since he first met you. I remember you telling me.'

*Pretty sure I never mentioned anything like that.*

Harry shrugged and headed down the steps. 'Thanks for telling me, Myrtle. Don't worry about Dumbledore.'

\'Bye, Harry,' she whispered after him. 'Thank you for coming to see me. It doesn't feel like anything's missing when you're here.'

\'How are your exams going?\' Salazar asked as he stepped into the study. \'Are they hard?\'

'A complete waste of time,' Harry said. 'If I didn't think I might need the grades and I didn't know Fleur would never let me hear the end of it if I didn't do well, I'd probably just not bother turning up.' He waved a hand at the time-turner. 'If things go wrong, I can always use that to cheat.'

\'Don\'t use that unless you absolutely have to,\' Salazar said. 'I warned you about the strain of using it on your mind. Nightmares will be the least of your worries if you keep putting that sort of pressure on yourself.\'

\'It\'s just a few sessions here and there for the next week or so.' Harry picked up Sirius's mirror. 'Right now I need to set up some wards on my house.'

'Be thorough,' Salazar said. 'I liked to leave an obvious way in. Most people jump at what seems like a minor risk and that stops them looking for another solution which might've been a better option.'

\'Sirius,\' Harry murmured. His breath fogged on the cold glass of the mirror.

\'Harry!\' Sirius's face appeared in the mirror. \'I'm sorry, I was

just having a very unusual conversation with my mother\'s portrait.\'

Harry shot him his best imitation of Fleur's smirk. \'Has she

found you a spouse?\'

\'Don\'t joke. She was being oddly civil, said something about me associating with some wizards of respectable descent and not being a completely lost cause. Told me I should take my responsibilities to the Black family more seriously, then proceeded to list every eligible pure-blood of close enough relation and with no allegiance to either Voldemort or Dumbledore as a potential heir to be named.\'

\'Was it a long list?\' Harry asked.

\'No. There\'s only one name on the list. He isn\'t even really a pure-blood, though my mother insists that he must be considered as one.\'

A sinking feeling crept upon Harry. \'Was my name really the only one?\'

Sirius laughed. \'First thing my mother and I have agreed on in twenty years. It only took most of the family dying for her to see sense again.\'

\'Are you alone?\' Harry asked. \'Coming to visit?\'

\'No. I\'m coming to pick you up and take you somewhere

exciting.\'

\'It had better not be another department of the Ministry,\' Sirius quipped. \'I\'ve already got a badge.\' He shifted the mirror to show off the badge he\'d obtained from the phonebox.

\'Can I apparate to you?\'

\'Actually, you probably can now.\' Sirius frowned. 'You have

Black blood and you know the secret.'

\'Now?\'

\'You\'re a recognised member of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black as of today.' Sirius grinned. \'You\'re even on the tapestry, which is more than can be said for me.\'

\'Wonderful. I\'m coming over.\' Harry set the mirror down and wrenched the world back past him until he stepped onto the hall at the foot of the stairs.

Sirius sat on the bottom step. A small white vase of violet flowers stood on the marble stones to his right.

\'So what exciting place are we going to?\' Sirius asked. \'My house,\' Harry said. \'I just bought it.\'

\'Ah, so that\'s how you intend to avoid the Dursleys,\' Sirius said. \'Dumbledore will never allow you to live on your own, though.\'

\'You\'ll see.\' Harry offered his arm in preparation to apparate.

Sirius grabbed his wrist and they stepped forward onto the front path of a small, neat little converted farmhouse. Sirius collapsed face-first into the grass.

\'Smooth.\' Harry glanced at the neat trees and grass.

'Welcome to my house. That I've never been to before.'

\'Where are we?\' Sirius asked.

\'West country.' Harry led him down the path toward a worn,

chipped white door.

'Your door needs repainting.'

\'You\'re going to make remarks about the condition of *my* house?\' Harry shook his head at Sirius. \'I had to kill a boggart last time I visited you.\'

\'Fair enough, but it *does* need repainting.\'

\'It needs more than that,\' Harry said. \'Furniture, paint, a new name, and some more serious wards.\'

He glimpsed a flash of silver hair though the window as they approached the peeling, white-painted door. *Fleur and Gabby are already here.* Harry knocked on the door.

Fleur opened the door. \'Welcome home, monCœur.\' She snaked an arm 'round him and drew his lips to hers.

Gabby craned her head 'round Fleur's shoulder. 'Fleur!

Share! In the veela harem, we're all sister-wives!' Harry choked. '*What?!'*

Fleur kicked Gabby in the shin with her heel. 'Ignore that.

She rediscovered some trashy veela-based romance novel last week in Maman's collection. It was written by a witch's witch who really wanted to spend her life surrounded by pretty blondes in lingerie.'

Harry chuckled. 'Goals for the future, Gabby?' She flushed. 'Nope.'

\'Harry?\' Sirius prodded him in the side. 'You're meant to introduce me.'

\'Oh. This is Fleur Delacour, my girlfriend, and behind her is Gabrielle Delacour, her younger sister.\'

\'Nice to meet you,' Sirius said. 'I'd say Harry's told me all about you, but he's actually told me nothing at all.'

\'Come in.\' Fleur ushered them both inside, shutting the door after Sirius and dislodging several slivers of paint.

Harry glanced at the bare walls and floorboards. 'Homely

place.'

\'You weren\'t joking about furniture,\' Sirius said. \'We really did only just buy it.\'

Sirius wrestled with himself. \'Just tell me! There\'s a long

story somewhere here.\'

\'We\'ve been together since the start of the summer,\' Harry said. \'It\'s quite a short story really.\'

\'Especially if he leaves out all the embarrassing parts,\' Fleur

jibed.

step.\'

Harry chuckled. \'Which I am definitely leaving out.'

\'So you\'re living together now?\' Sirius asked. \'That\'s quite a

\'Yes it is,\' Gabby murmured.

Fleur shot Harry a long look. 'Perhaps I should tell Sirius

about us, while you and Gabby talk, monCœur.'

\'Shall we go out the back?\' Harry suggested.

Gabby pattered across the floorboards after him in her small, white socks, shutting the door behind Harry.

He raised an eyebrow. 'Planning on finally eloping with me?'

A small smile flitted across her face. 'No. I wanted to talk with you seriously for a bit.'

Harry nodded. 'Talk away, Gabby.'

\'I don't like the idea of my sister living here in England on her own for most of the year,' she said. \'She is safer in France, all her dreams are in France, all of them except *you*.\'

\'I won\'t let anything happen to her, Gabby.\' A hot, tight knot coiled in his chest. The sharp, cold teeth of the void chewed at his heart. 'I can't lose her.'

\'If you asked, if you really forced her to, she'd come back to France with me,\' Gabby murmured. 'Could you do that?'

\'She'd hate me. I promised her I wouldn't.' Harry cringed. \'I

don\'t think I could endure that.\'

\'Not even if it saved her life?\'

'She wouldn't forgive me,' Harry whispered. 'She might not *leave,* but she'd never forget I made her do that. I --- I can't, Gabby. I'm sorry.'

'Show me.' Gabby reached out one hand and placed it over Harry\'s heart, spreading her fingers across his chest and closing her eyes. 'You can use legilimency and I've a gift for sensing the emotion in magic. Prove you *really* can't do it.'

Harry met her grey eyes and drew on a little magic to connect them, letting all the feelings that came with thoughts of Fleur seep through the bond.

A quiet gasp slipped through Gabby's lips. 'How strange,' she murmured. 'I thought it would be all soft, fluffy love, but there's so much *fear*.'

'I need her.' Harry broke the connection and turned away. 'I just... do.'

'I felt it.' Gabby put a hand on his shoulder. \'Fleur needs you, too, you know. She's tied all her dreams to you and there's nothing she wouldn't do to protect you and them. Don't forget that. Just because everyone else has let you down doesn't mean she will.'

'I know.' Harry buried thoughts of a fading red sunset, a burning ring of gold on Fleur's finger, and the tall, strong shadow at her side. 'I *do* know.'

'But it's hard.' Gabby's grey eyes darkened to a charcoal hue and small white feathers prickled across her neck. 'If you hurt my sister because of your inability to trust, I will hurt *you*, Harry. She deserves nothing but your full faith. She's *risking her life* just to spend the summer with you.'

Guilt twisted in his chest like a blade. 'I know.' He tried to hold Gabby's charcoal gaze, but couldn't. 'I'll try. I promise.'

Her eyes lightened. 'If you're struggling, come talk to me.

Nobody knows Fleur better than me.' She wiggled her fingers. 'And I

*always* understand what you're feeling.'

Harry mustered a grin. 'More cheating veela magic.'

to cast.'

Gabby grinned. 'Come on, then. We have a Fidelius charm

Harry followed her back through into the other room.

\'I'm satisfied,' Gabby chirped. 'Let's go cast it!'

\'Cast what?\' Sirius asked.

\'The Fidelius. Gabby will be our secret keeper. Dumbledore

can't send me to the Dursleys if he can't find me.\'

\'I can do it,\' Sirius offered. \'Wouldn\'t you rather Voldemort comes after me?\'

'Gabby will be far out of his reach and he won't even know of my connection to her,\' Harry said. \'And when Dumbledore comes looking, you will be too obvious a choice.\'

\'The last time words like that were spoken they were mine.\' Sirius's face darkened. 'It was the last thing I ever said to James and Lily.\'

\'I can do it.\' Gabby huffed and darted out through the front door onto the path. \'This way I know that Fleur and Harry are safe so long as my lips are sealed.\'

Sirius raised his hands in defeat as they followed her out. 'I concede.'

\'Close your eyes, Sirius,\' Harry said. \'I don\'t know what would happen if you watched the charm being cast since you aren't technically part of it. Don't open them until we tell you the secret.\'

Fleur pulled her wand out. 'Gabby, monCœur, this may feel

strange.'

A soft white glow appeared at the tip of her wand, slim threads of light swirled 'round it, snaking through the air and falling over him like a net, fading into his skin. Harry felt the magic curl 'round his heart; a tight, short shackle stretching back to Fleur.

'Gabby...' Fleur sent the glowing speck of light floating across onto the tip of Gabby's wand. 'Hold onto that.' She touched her fingertips to her chest, then pulled a slim thread of bright azure away; it curled into a small flame that danced on her palm. 'Gabrielle?'

Gabby swallowed and scooped the flame out of Fleur's palm. 'This is...'

'Me.' A small, soft smile crooked the corner of Fleur's lips. 'That is me.'

Gabby cupped it in her hands, then pressed the flame to her chest; it flickered, slipping through her clothes and vanishing, and she shivered.

'Mon Cœur,' Fleur whispered. 'Give yourself to Gabby.'

Harry's fingers slid to his sternum and the magic churned beneath his hand. His wand turned hot as flame against his forearm and unease prickled down his spine, coiling in his gut. *Just do it.*

Gabby's eyes flicked to his. 'You can trust me, Harry,' she murmured. 'I promise.'

*It doesn't matter. I have to do it anyway.* He closed his fist against his ribs and ripped it out. *Or Fleur's not safe.*

Wisps of black mist trailed through his clenched knuckles as he thrust his arm at Gabby.

She pried it from his fingers and pressed it against her sternum with a shudder and a gasp. 'Mon Dieu! That's *cold.*'

The shackle clamped about Harry's heart and snapped back toward Gabby like he was hooked on a fishing line. It wrenched at something deep inside, tearing a groan from his lips. The light at the end of Gabby's wand zipped into the sky and burst into a shower of silver sparks, sending a shimmer rippling away over the fields.

Fleur wrinkled her nose, then sagged a little. 'And done.'

\'Harry Potter and Fleur Delacour live at the Meadow,\' Gabby whispered.

Sirius cracked open an eye. 'Done?'

Harry looked at Fleur.

'Done,' she repeated. 'Are you okay, Gabby?'

\'I could do with something to eat.\' Gabby grinned. \'Do you have anything tasty?\'

\'In Britain?\' Fleur laughed. 'Non.'

\'I can probably supply you with a lifetime\'s worth of sherbet lemons,\' Harry suggested. 'Dumbledore has hundreds of them and they\'re quite tasty, but I\'ll have to steal them from his office.\'

'Okay. You owe me a sherbet lemon. I want to try one. I\'ve never heard of them before.\' Gabby looked around the house. \'If you don't have anything tasty, then take me back to France, Fleur, I need to study. And you both owe me a trip to somewhere nice in Paris.\'

\'Come on then, little chick.\' Fleur shot her sister a warm

smile. 'I'll be back later, monCœur.'

\'Bye Harry.\' Gabby stepped forward and hugged him, then pulled his head down to whisper in his ear. \'If you don't trust her, you'll lose her. Maman's books are right about that.\'

*I trust her.* Harry tried to push it into his eyes. *She's never*

*done anything for me not to.*

Fleur took a firm grip on Gabby's shoulder and the two

vanished.

\'She can apparate silently,\' Sirius said.

\'She does it to rub it in my face.\' Harry chuckled. \'She knows I can\'t do it.\'

\'You\'re a lucky guy, that\'s one hell of a girl you\'ve got there, Harry. James would be so very proud of you. She\'s a veela, isn\'t she?\'

\'Yes.\' A small smile crept onto his lips. \'Is her magic an issue

for you?\'

\'After Azkaban?\' Sirius's smile twisted into a grimace. \'Not

even a little bit.\'

'Good.' Harry sighed. 'How's Dumbledore been?'

'Busy.' Sirius fixed Harry with a long look. 'Amelia Bones and Rufus Scrimgeour are fighting for Fudge's seat. Neither are any friend to Voldemort. Dumbledore seems quite pleased with how everything has turned out, really. He\'s assured the whole Order you\'re on the right path to defeat Voldemort.\'

\'He\'s more right than he realises,\' Harry said. 'I'm close, Sirius. There's still *him*, of course, but we're only one step away from making sure he doesn't come back again.'

*Diary. Diadem. And one more somewhere.*

'I won't ask.' Sirius cracked a grin. 'If I don't know, Dumbledore can't get anything out of me. Just be careful, Harry. Hiding away in a little house is no way to spend your life. If things go wrong, if Dumbledore's schemes unravel, if Voldemort starts to win, just *leave.* Take Fleur and go far away. Find somewhere to be happy together. This isn't your fight. You're supposed to be sixteen, doing things sixteen year olds do.'

*Neither can live while the other survives.*

'Voldemort won't stop chasing me.' Harry stared up at the sky and imagined the streaks of red light fading away in the distance. 'There's nowhere to run where we won't end up hiding. Fleur won't want to live like that.'

*She'd try. She'd try so hard, but in the end she'd leave.* He could see it behind closed eyes. Her bright eyes dimming as the price of being tied to him wore her smile away*. Of course she'd leave.*

*Anyone would.*

Sirius's brow creased. 'I guess we'd better win, then.' 'Whatever it takes,' Harry murmured.

# The Notebook

The bent nib of her quill scratched its way down the last page of a twelve page form, then rose up as the stack of paper thudded down to the pile on the floor. Fleur ignored it and levitated an obsidian dagger from her crate.

'That looks boring.' Bill Weasley's voice came from just behind

her.

Cold shock tore through her. She swivelled 'round and

smothered the heat of her change. 'Do *not* do that.'

Bill raised his hands. 'Sorry. Sorry.' He dipped into his pocket and produced a small wooden cube. 'Have a look at this.' He waved a hand at the forms. 'This all seems to be going fine, so I won't waste your time going over it.'

Fleur plucked the cube from his fingers. 'What is it?'

Bill grinned. 'Take a look and see. It's no fun if I tell you.'

She placed it on the desk and traced her wand over it. A strange sense of calm seeped from the cube and little lights danced across its surface. 'It's *nice*.'

'Any idea what it does?'

*Another test? Or just a puzzle he's solved and wants to show off?*

'It calms.' Fleur put her wand away. 'Some kind of toy?' Bill nodded. 'A child's toy. Pulled it out of a tomb near

Larissa about three years ago with my team. There was a bunch of

Macedonian gold in there and the goblins let me keep this as part of

my bonus. I keep it at work for when things get frustrating.'

Fleur pushed it back toward him on the desk with one finger.

'Am I still a curse-breaker?'

'Well, you still have both your arms...' Bill's grin widened. 'So you're doing better than the last one.'

'Yes.' The clock chimed from Agdol's office. 'And now I have lunch, so\... au revoir.'

'Cold shoulder. Ouch!' Bill laughed. 'Fair enough. I'll drop by in a few days so I can say you're not running around unsupervised, but otherwise, I'll stay out of your hair.'

'Thank you.' Fleur slid out of her chair and strode toward the

apparition point.

'Wait.' Bill strode after her. 'I---'

'Don't offer to buy me lunch,' Fleur said. 'I'm not interested.' 'Okay.' Bill tugged at the dragon fang dangling from his ear. 'I

mean, I wasn't going to anyway, fairly sure you mentioned a

boyfriend, but okay. No, I was going to offer you a challenge.' He bounced the cube on his hand. 'I've loads of little trinkets like this. Whole storeroom of them. Anything we don't fully understand, we can't sell, so we keep them all. You took apart that canopic jar like a pro, so I'm curious to see if you can help with the rest.'

Fleur glanced at the cube, then back at the stack of forms. 'I suppose it will be more interesting than those.'

'Loads more. I have absolutely no idea what most of them do!' Bill watched the quill continue filling in boxes and snorted. 'Not that *you're* actually doing any of that.'

'It is boring.' Fleur turned her nose up. 'Why would I choose to do it if I don't have to?'

'I don't suppose you'd make one of those for me?' Bill asked. 'Can't *you?*'

Bill fingered his earring. 'Not really. I'm good at taking things apart, not so good at putting them together.'

'I will make you one if you go away and let me have my lunch in peace,' Fleur suggested.

He laughed and gave her a thumbs up. 'Sounds like a deal.

Enjoy!' He hurried off toward the stairs.

*He's not so bad. Better than the others, at least.* Fleur wrinkled her nose and hastened to the apparition point. *And Harry is busy with exams, so at least I'll have someone to talk to.*

She apparated out into Diagon Alley, then strode toward the café with the blue umbrellas and settled into a seat in the corner. Fleur checked the hedge, concealed her hair, then propped the menu up to hide her face. 'Carrot cake, crumble, chocolate cake, and that English *abomination*.'

'Any drinks?' The waitress bounced across. 'Some tea?'

Fleur lowered the menu. A bunch of curse-breakers caught her eye from the street and drifted toward her.

*Merde.*

'I'm not a tea drinker.' She swept an eye down the drinks list. 'Just water, please. And two slices of chocolate cake.'

'Back in just a minute.' The waitress bustled off.

'Miss Delacour, right? I'm Jim.' One of the curse-breakers leant over the hedge and ran a hand through his thinning dark hair. His belly curved over the top of the neat, green leaves. 'Saw you with Bill in the office the other day. He said you'd solved that annoying screaming jar?'

Fleur sighed. 'I did.'

'Fancy some company?' Jim jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. 'Me and the lads would be happy to show you 'round. Or just me, if you're not a fan of crowds.'

The waitress slipped a pair of plates and a glass of water onto

the table. 'There you go, Miss.'

Fleur picked up her fork and sliced the tip off both pieces of

cake. 'I'm quite happy by myself, thank you.'

'Don't be like that, love.' Jim's belly pressed a little further through the hedge. 'We're not all bad. We don't bite or anything. Don't sit all by your lonesome, come and have a natter with us. We're still waiting for Bill, so there's no rush with that cake.'

Bill shouldered his way through the group. 'Jim. Stop

bothering Fleur and get over here.'

Jim's jaw clenched and he rolled his eyes. 'Slave driver, our boss. Catch you some other time, huh, babe?'

Fleur took a mouthful of cake and slid the menu stand 'round

in between the two of them. The gaggle of curse-breakers guffawed

as Jim slunk back into their midst. Out of the corner of her eye, she watched them stare at her as Bill tried to chivvy them down the street toward the pub.

'Top effort, Jim!' One gave him a double thumbs up. 'You sure

charmed the pants off her!'

*The things I endure for you, monCœur.* Fleur took another mouthful of chocolate. *At least this cake is half good.*

Footsteps shuffled along the hedge and someone cleared their throat. 'Fleur?' Bill peered over the top of her menu. 'Thought I'd come apologise for that. They're decent lads, but, well, a girl who looks like you makes them forget stuff, so, sorry on their behalf, I guess.'

'That's okay.' Fleur slid the menu aside. 'I'm used to it.'

Bill grimaced. 'Yeah. I bet.' He bounced the fang earring on the ball of his thumb. 'Look. If they bother you, just give me a holler, yeah? They mean well, but sometimes their hormones bubble up.' He grinned. 'You should see them on digs. Six months in tents with not a girl in sight, the first poor lass they stumble over on the route back usually has to break a nose to get rid of them.'

Fleur let a little heat bubble up until her eyes darkened. 'I will do a lot more than that, Bill. And my boyfriend, well, I don't think he'd be pleased to see them trying anything like that.'

*Harry would hate it. Like he hates anything that might steal his perfect wish away.* A cold finger traced down her spine. *Who knows what he'd do to them if they managed to make him feel threatened.*

Bill shrugged. 'I'd recommend he doesn't start anything. My lads are pretty hardy.' He held up his hands. 'I'll keep them in line, though. As best as those bastards *can* be kept in line. Fair warning,

however, no ring on your hand means they see you as fair game.' He grinned. 'I believe you. No way a girl as warm and friendly and you is single, so I've got your back. That bunch may take a bit more convincing, though.'

'Fantastic.' Fleur mimicked Harry's dry tone and slid the menu back across in front of Bill's face.

He lingered, shuffled his feet, and laughed. 'Alright then, Fleur. I'll get gone. See you in a few days. I'll bring something interesting for us to play with!' His footsteps receded into the crowd.

She tugged her necklace out. 'Azure.'

It bloomed into a tree, then spread into a mirror.

Harry's face appeared. 'Fleur!' The left side of his mouth curved up into a grin. 'How's work?'

'Boring.' Fleur rolled her eyes. 'But you can make it up to me.' 'Oh I can, can I?' A teasing glint welled up in his green eyes.

'I'm fairly sure *you* chose to work there, so it's your own fault.'

She shook her cake fork at him. 'I had to come and keep an eye on you. Who knows what you'd get up to if I left you to your own devices.'

'Well, you didn't have to work at Gringotts.' Harry frowned. 'Why *are* you working? You don't have to, do you?'

Fleur shrugged. 'It was a lot easier to explain to my parents and I don't have to justify a gap in my resume to anyone.' She put the fork down and took a sip of water to wash the chocolate off her tongue. 'Now. I have half an hour here to eat cake and think, then I'm going to go look at furniture. What should I be thinking about?'

Harry grinned. 'Me?'

'You and who?' Fleur arched an eyebrow at him. 'Katie Bell?'

He sighed. 'Not a threat, mon Rêve.' A faint shadow loomed in his eyes and he swallowed hard. 'I would *never,* Fleur. *Never*.'

'I was only joking, monCœur. I know.'

*Not that I like how close she still is to you.* Fleur watched the gleam fade from his eyes. *But no, you'd never risk your sunset. Only a very stupid girl would throw away that kind of devotion because you still talk to someone you once dated.*

'Well, I don't know what you mean?' Harry's forehead wrinkled. 'Think about what?'

Fleur sighed and narrowed her eyes at him. 'Don't be frustrating, Harry. I am in this country for *one* reason. You. And we need to find those... *horcruxes.* So what should I be thinking about besides buying our house some furniture?'

Harry glanced to either side, then drew back into the shadows against a pale, stone wall. 'Where the last one is, I suppose.'

'You're sure it's the last?' Fleur demanded. She plucked her cake fork off the plate and sliced off a thick swathe of chocolate icing, then let it melt on her tongue.

'He would've made a certain number of them.' Harry's expression turned distant. 'Three, I think. They need to be made with objects that are... *precious* to the creator. Three would be more than enough. I destroyed his diary, the diadem, and I don't think I count. I wasn't made deliberately; he wouldn't keep trying to kill me if I was.'

*So we need to find one more.* Fleur tapped the end of her fork on the table. *And I suppose it's not going to just turn up somewhere convenient.*

'Where were the other two?' she asked.

'Lucius Malfoy had the diary. The diadem was hidden in the Room of Requirement.'

A jolt of ice shot through Fleur. 'We were in there! I took

*Gabby* there.'

Harry's smile twisted into something thin and wry. 'And I put it on my head and listened to it. It's gone now. That's all that matters.'

'Right.' Fleur took another mouthful of cake and shot him an icing-glazed smirk. 'So, one of his followers had one and he hid the other.'

'I'm not sure.' Harry shrugged. 'I suppose we can start with his other followers. Nobody will miss most of them.'

*We.* Fleur's lips curved. *That's better. You're my sunset, too, monCœur.*

'I will start to research. Gringotts knows all sorts.' She waved her fork and blew him a kiss. 'Au revoir.'

# A Nice Lemon

Lines of text swam before Harry's eyes. He blinked, then

squeezed them shut.

'I'm going to miss days like this.\' Salazar sighed. 'How's the

book?'

'*The Time-Traveller's Life*?' Harry set it down on the desk

beside the small golden hourglass. 'Probably not as good as *A Thousand and One Snake Puns,* but it does explain how the mental load of using the time-turner builds and builds.'

'Which might explain your nightmares.'

'Yes.' He grimaced. 'Although any new nightmares are likely to feature another essay about wand legislature and goblin rebellions.'

Salazar snorted. 'Goblins. Greedy, stubborn, cunning, brutal creatures. One day, they will try to bite off more than they can chew again and someone will inflict another harrowing upon them.'

'Someone has?' Harry squinted at the painting. 'I thought they kept winning?'

'Winning?' Salazar laughed. 'In the tunnels, in the dark, where they can bring all their gifts of enchanting, their numbers, and their cunning to bear, yes, they will win. But above ground? No. They tried. They lost. Rome drove them so deep underground and shed so much goblin blood they still mourned their shame when I lived.'

\'Well, good thing that wasn't in my exam.' Harry closed *The Time-Traveller's Life.* 'I think I've learnt all I need from that book.

Definitely time to take a break from the spinning gold hourglass of

impending insanity.'

Salazar's eyes darkened. 'Yes. It is.'

Harry leant forward. 'What is it, you old cave painting?' 'You\'re out of time, Harry.' Salazar's serpent looped round

his neck with a soft hiss. 'This quiet, slow week of work and books is the deep breath before the storm breaks.'

'Surely I still have a year or so?' Harry asked. 'At least a summer?'

*One more summer with Fleur.*

\'Why?\' Salazar asked. 'You have stripped the shadows from Voldemort and Dumbledore's plan to hurl you into his path looms closer with every second.'

'Dumbledore implied he had things to do first,\' Harry said.

'Voldemort... I can hide from him. I can hide from him until I'm ready.'

\'Presumably Dumbledore also knows there's likely another horcrux or two,\' Salazar replied. \'Their existence is the only thing, aside from any action you take, preventing Albus Dumbledore from, say, leaving you somewhere only his followers and Voldemort can enter due to blood magic based wards, then waiting for an inevitable conclusion.\'

\'Well, when you say it like that...\' Harry wrinkled his nose.

\'I\'m not going back to endure Privet Drive. Never again. Never.\'

'I can see the sunset in your eyes, Harry,' Salazar murmured. 'You need a plan to reach it. A strong will and focus may make spells work, but it's not enough for *life*.'

'I have to kill him.' Harry's heart clenched. 'If I don't, I'll lose everything.'

'You'll lose *her*.' Shadows rose in Salazar's eyes. 'You *mustn't* lose her, Harry. You've tied so much of yourself to her that life will be unbearable without her, I would know.'

*I know.*

Harry drew himself up. 'What do I need to do?'

'Solve your own problems,' Salazar griped. 'You think I don't have anything better to do than fix your woes?'

He glanced 'round the library. 'I mean...'

'Brat,' Salazar muttered. 'But I suppose you've no idea what you're doing, do you?'

'I have to destroy a horcrux. I got the diadem and the diary, but there's one more.' Harry offered the painting a wry grin. 'Perhaps I'll be lucky enough that this one drops into my hands, too.'

'I doubt it.' Salazar jabbed his wand toward Harry. 'The fool who used that diary as a weapon will beg for death when Voldemort realises what he did with it. The diadem was hidden here almost carelessly, but if there is anything left of Tom in Voldemort, then I suspect he meant to take this place as his seat of power upon his victory. He must have intended it to be safe within his own grasp.'

Harry glanced up. 'Hogwarts was important to him?' 'Very.' Salazar sighed. 'A new world for Tom to belong to,

only, of course, it wasn't in the end.'

'It has to be an object he was very attached to,' Harry whispered. 'His diary, that diadem, since you told him the story, and something else he treasured.'

Salazar's lips twisted. 'I don't remember, I'm afraid. I should, but I don't. I suspect Tom saw to that when he left.'

'I'll find it. Maybe Dumbledore will find it for me.'

'You need to get out from under that man's rule.' Silver sparks sputtered from Salazar's wand. 'He has draped a noose around your neck, Harry. Step away from the gallows as quickly as you can! You have a well-protected home and Voldemort has other enemies to think about in Dumbledore and the Ministry. Get out of Hogwarts as swiftly and subtly as possible.'

'I can't let Dumbledore think I'm up to anything, in case he changes his plans.'

'Exactly.'

Harry clenched his fists until his nails bit into his palms. 'I wish it would all just go away. Sometimes, when I wake up, I close my eyes, and hope that when I reopen them I'll be in France with Fleur again.'

'It will not go away,' Salazar murmured. 'You will have to destroy the horcrux. You will have to face and kill Voldemort. You will have to convince or fool Dumbledore into believing you are no longer a horcrux.' A small smile crossed his lips. 'Then you can close your eyes and dream of France, Harry.'

Harry sighed. \'Whatever it takes, I suppose.' He drummed his fingers on the desk. 'My NEWTs will have to be taken early, then. I need those to be able to leave Hogwarts without causing a stir. And then there's that horcrux\...\'

Salazar stroked the blunt head of the snake entwined about his neck. \'He entrusted an anchor to one of the members of his inner circle and had a second where he likely intended to be able to protect it. It\'s possible he gave the other to a different follower.\'

\'Crabbe, Goyle, Nott, the Lestranges, and probably others I don't know about.\' Harry grimaced. 'It won't be easy to prise anything out of them, Voldemort has all his servants hidden away somewhere.'

'Not for long. The storm will break soon. Study for your NEWTs over the summer while you wait for the war to begin, then get out of Dumbledore's noose.' Salazar tapped a gentle staccato upon his serpent's spine with his fingertips. 'When the war comes, you can hover in its shadow. Pick off the members of Voldemort's inner circle to find the horcrux, bleed his strength away, then face him and kill him however you can.'

'And Dumbledore? He will still think I need to die.'

'I do not know the man.' Salazar's lip curled. 'But I cannot say I like him, not from what you've told me, nor from what Tom did. Sometimes, you have to do a little evil to serve a greater good. Albus Dumbledore seems to know this well, but he manipulates others into dirtying their hands to keep his clean. Trick him if you can, kill him if you must.'

'Sounds great,' Harry quipped. 'Nice, cheerful summer holiday. Bit of studying, some time with Fleur, a small killing spree, destroying a horcrux, killing the wizard half the country thinks is the most powerful in the world, then tricking the one the other half of the country thinks is the most powerful.'

'Men who don't aim high, don't reach very far.' Salazar folded his arms. 'You must also ward this chamber before you leave

for the summer. Now Voldemort is revealed, he is much more likely

to risk using it to attack the school and Dumbledore.'

\'That sounds like it would probably disturb me studying for my NEWTs.' Harry frowned. 'And while I'm pretty good at Transfiguration, Defence and Charms, Potions and Advanced Arithmancy will require a lot of study, especially if I ask to take them early.\'

Salazar's face remained sober. \'When you come down here to leave for the summer, I'll show you how to ward the chamber. I\'ve had all year to think of how best to do it.'

'We both know you've spent most of the time napping like an old woman in her rocking chair,' Harry muttered.

'Don't mumble, brat!' Salazar snapped. 'Now shoo.' He flapped his hands at Harry. 'I wish to be alone to think.'

Harry rolled his eyes and traipsed out, sliding his wand from his sleeve. *I'll try out a new spell, then.*

\'Contusio,\' he murmured, compressing his magic into a small point just beyond the ebony tip of his wand.

A silver speck of light trailed through the air in front of him as he moved his wand from side to side.

*Voldemort managed several, but one's a good start.*

Harry flicked his wrist and sent it sailing across the chamber.

The small spark drifted through the air like a glowing ember cast from a bonfire toward the chamber's wall. A violent flash of bright silver seared at his eyes and an explosion rippled back past him, sending his head spinning and ringing.

He pressed his hands over his ears until the high-pitched whine faded. *Well, that's not what Voldemort did, but I quite like it.*

A furious stream of parseltongue echoed from the study.

*Time to vacate for a bit. Salazar hates loud distractions when he's thinking even more than I do.* He beat a swift, tiptoed retreat back up the steps toward Myrtle\'s Bathroom.

The perpetual puddle spread from wall to wall. Harry sighed and splashed through it.

'I'm so sorry,' Myrtle whispered from within her cubicle. 'I'm

so sorry.'

Harry paused by the door and watched the puddle lap at his

heels. Myrtle's silver form drifted out of the cubicle and away into the

wall.

*No hello? Guess she's not in a good mood today.* He headed through the corridors back to Gryffindor Tower.

Hermione and the other Fifth Years sat around one of the corner tables, reading and playing exploding snap. Katie sprawled across the sofa by the fire. She caught his eye and gave him a wave.

\'Not packing?\' Harry flopped into the cushions beside her.

\'No.\' Katie beamed and pushed her cold feet under Harry's thigh. 'I can\'t fit everything in my trunk and my shrinking charms won\'t last long enough for the journey back, so I've given up for now.'

\'You want me to help?\' Harry offered. 'Mine will last.'

\'If you want, it'll only take a second, then we can come back

down here next to the fire. It\'s loud upstairs with everyone packing.\'

She jumped up and grabbed his hand, towing him up toward the stairs.

Harry put one foot on the stairs and they shifted into a slide.

Katie squeaked and jumped back onto his foot.

\'How inconvenient.\' He slipped out his wand and tugged his foot out from under Katie. \'If this doesn\'t work, you\'ll have to do your own packing.'

Hermione huffed and poked her head up over the top of her

book. 'Boys can't---\'

'Confundus,' Harry said.

The stairs reverted back to their original form with Harry\'s foot still on the first step. A low murmur ran round the common room and Hermione's book thudded to the table.

\'Someone make a note of how he did that,\' Seamus muttered. \'That\'s got to be the most useful thing we\'ve seen all year.\'

\'That\'s against the rules!\' Hermione cried.

\'What\'s he going to do?\' Ron asked. \'Steal your underwear?

Calm down, Hermione.\'

\'Have you somehow not heard what his father was like from Padfoot?\' Hermione replied. \'There won\'t be a pair of panties left in Gryffindor Tower by tomorrow.\'

Katie giggled and dragged Harry up the rest of the steps. \'Where *is* Hermione\'s spot?\' Harry asked.

She laughed and led him up to her dormitory. Stacks of quidditch jerseys and other clothes filled her bed halfway from

mattress to canopy. A strangled exclamation echoed from the far corner.

once.\'

room.

\'Sorry, Leanne,\' Katie said. 'But at least you\'re dressed for

Her roommate turned scarlet and fled toward the common

\'Now I\'ve got room to watch you pack,\' Katie said.

*\'I\'m* going to shrink things.\' Harry sat down in the window.

\'*You\'re* doing all the actual packing.\'

She fluttered her eyelashes at him. \'What if I asked really

nicely?\'

\'Not even then, Dark Mistress.' Harry waved his wand at the

stacks of clothes and watched them shrink down to about a third of their former height.

\'Fine...\' Katie scooped the piles off the bed and stuffed them into her battered trunk. \'I hate packing.\'

\'You\'re terrible at it.\' Harry laughed as something black and

lacy fell out of one of the piles. 'But you do have some *nice* clothes.'

\'Not one more word.\' Katie growled, flushing bright red and shoving it back out of sight.

\'So who did you buy that for?\' Harry teased.

'Katie!' Alicia gaped from the doorway. Two high spots of

colour rose on her cheeks.

\'Harry\'s helping me *pack*, Alicia,\' Katie said. \'I needed him to shrink everything so the spell lasts all the way back to London.\'

\'Oh.\' Alicia clapped her mouth shut. \'I just wanted to ask if you had any room in your trunk for an extra pair of shoes?\'

\'Nope.\' Katie tried to force the lid of her trunk down with both hands; it didn't budge. \'Couldn\'t you have shrunk them a little more, Harry?\' she demanded.

\'And miss out on this?\' Harry grinned. 'I don't think so.'

Alicia glanced between them with pursed lips, then turned on her heel and stalked out.

*She's still pissed, then.*

Katie pouted. \'Are you going to help?'

\'I suppose I could.\' Harry got up and put one foot on the trunk so Katie could lock it shut.

\'Thanks.\' She beamed up through a scatter of mahogany hair and sat back on her knees, flushed and panting. \'Shall we go back down?' A wicked little glint appeared in her eyes. 'Or is there something else you'd rather I do now you've got me on my knees in front of you, Harry.'

He snorted. 'I'd like to have my Firebolt back.'

Katie laughed. 'I'd rather you took the *other* option. That

Firebolt's*fantastic.*'

'Well, in that case we might as well head back down.' He mussed her hair as she pushed herself to her feet. 'Don\'t look *too* dishevelled, Katie dearest, let\'s not have *another* article written about us.'

She straightened her robes and smoothed her hair; a little of the pink faded from her cheeks. \'If anyone believes *that* your

reputation is going to suffer. We\'ve only been up here alone for about a minute or two.\'

\'You never did tell me who you had in mind when you bought that very fetching underwear?' Harry asked. 'Maybe you should be propositioning them instead of me?'

\'And I\'m not going to tell you.\' Katie stuck her tongue out.

'So you can stop picturing me in them.\'

A brief flash of her passed through his mind. Snatches of Fleur's nude body muddled with Katie's darker hair and eyes, the little bundle of black lace slipping down past her knees. *Fleur would look very nice in them.* He swallowed down the little flare of desire before it curdled into frustration. *It's going to be a good summer.*

'Lost in thought, Harry?' Katie giggled. 'Do I look good in

them?'

'They don't match the seashell bra,' Harry replied. 'It's very

disappointing.'

Katie sighed and bit her lip. 'I guess in that case I'd just have to take the bra off.'

Harry rolled his eyes. 'I'm immune to you now.'

She pouted. 'Only because Frenchie stole your innocence and ruined my fun.' She folded her arms and stuck her lower lip out a little further. 'You were supposed to be mine to tease.'

A quiet cheer and a round of applause rose from the boys when they came back down the stairs. Harry laughed and settled back into the sofa with Katie beside him.

\'I think that did more for altering your Dark Lord reputation

than anything else,' she said.

\'No self-respecting Dark Lord spends his time sneaking into girls\' dormitories and bathrooms,\' Harry said.

\'Alicia\'s going to give me an earful about that later, though.

She wasn\'t happy to see us up there together.\'

*She needs to drop her silly grudge. It's not our fault Rita*

*Skeeter wrote that stupid article.*

'Want me to say something or do something?'

She waved a hand at him. \'Don\'t worry about it. She\'s leaving this year, you won\'t have to worry about it anymore.\'

\'You will,\' Harry said.

\'It\'ll be fine. Now how was your History of Magic exam?\' \'Tedious.\' Harry groaned. \'I lost all feeling in my hand

halfway through the essay. That\'s a subject I won\'t be missing next year.\'

\'That\'s the best thing about going from OWLs to NEWTs,\' Katie said. \'No more Binns. Not that you went to any of his lessons this year, anyway. Have you chosen which ones you want to take?\'

'Similar to yours, actually. Transfiguration, Defence, Charms,

Potions and Advanced Arithmancy.\'

\'Five\'s a lot, especially with *Advanced Arithmancy* in there*.* The only thing I hate more than Arithmancy is Slytherin winning at quidditch.'

'And getting through an entire conversation without some kind of innuendo or lewd comment,' Harry quipped.

'You love it,' Katie retorted. 'I'm your best friend.'

The portrait swung open and Dennis Creevey bounced across the room wearing a vast grin on his face.

\'Looks like the raven didn\'t get him after all,\' Harry muttered.

'Ah well, there's always next year.'

\'It got Pansy Parkinson\'s wand for a bit, though,\' she said.

'And a few others, apparently.'

The younger Creevey bounded across to their sofa and began babbling at Harry while staring at him in a rather starstruck manner.

giggling.

\'Once more please, Dennis?\' Harry asked, ignoring Katie\'s

\'Professor Dumbledore would like to see you,\' Dennis

blurted. \'Professor McGonagall said something about you both enjoying sherbet lemons, but I didn\'t really understand.\'

\'Thanks, Dennis.\' Harry grimaced and exchanged a brief glance with Katie.

\'He probably just wants to know why you aren\'t in the hospital wing this year,\' she suggested. 'Want me to come, just in case?'

Harry shook his head. \'I\'d better go and find out by myself. If I come back quite late and don\'t see you guys before you leave tomorrow, then I hope you have a good summer, Katie dearest. I

doubt we\'ll be able to exchange letters, but I\'m sure we can try and meet up or something.\'

\'Why won\'t we see you on the train?\' Katie asked. \'I can apparate,\' Harry whispered.

She shot him a look of pure envy. 'That means you have no excuse for not coming to see me in the summer. You\'ll be able to find me on Diagon Alley easily enough. My parents own one of the cafés on the South side of the alley and I\'ll be helping out.\'

'Helping out... in a café... with *goblets or cups?*' Harry asked. She laughed. 'My cup count is currently at twenty eight.

Mum keeps a tally.'

'I better go, then.' Harry heaved himself out of the sofa and

hurried out through the passage.

Professor McGonagall stood outside with pursed lips and a sherbet lemon caught between her forefinger and thumb. \'I believe this is for you, Mr Potter.'

\'Thanks, Professor.\' Harry unwrapped the sweet and slipped it in his mouth.

*Probably should've given it to Gabby. Ah well, I can buy her some from somewhere, I'm sure.*

\'You shouldn\'t encourage the headmaster to give you muggle sweets, Mr Potter,\' Professor McGonagall chided. \'They\'re very sickly and not at all good for you.\'

\'This is the first year I\'ve not ended up in the hospital wing.\' Harry grinned. \'It\'s also the first year I\'ve accepted a sherbet lemon. Coincidence? I think not, professor.\'

McGonagall gave him a long-suffering expression and led him toward the gargoyle. \'Sometimes, Mr Potter, you act a great deal like your father.\'

\'So Snape tells me.'

\'Sherbetlemon.\' Professor McGonagall sighed and gestured at the stairs. \'I will see you next year, Mr Potter. I\'m assured that there\'s a very good chance you will be in my class.\'

\'I\'ll be there,\' Harry said.

*But maybe not for as long as everyone else is.* He crunched the sherbet lemon and swallowed it down. *Not if I can help it.*

Harry poked his head through the door to the office.

Dumbledore leant back in his chair on the other side of the desk, holding his hand out in supplication to Fawkes, who held the bowl of sherbet lemons hostage in his talons.

\'Harry.' His eyes twinkled. \'If you\'d be so kind as to bear with me for a moment, Fawkes is experiencing a bout of adolescent rebellion. Sadly, being a phoenix, they come about more frequently than one might hope.\'

Fawkes trilled, tilting his head at Dumbledore, then hopped from his perch to replace the bowl on the wrong side of the desk, just out of reach of the seated headmaster.

Dumbledore chuckled. \'I suppose that will have to do.'

\'What did you wish to speak with me about, sir?\' Harry

asked.

\'About the summer.' Dumbledore eased his chair a few

inches closer to the desk.

\'What about it, professor?\' Harry raised his eyebrows.

'Voldemort?'

\'You know, of course, that you have to return to your relatives to be as safe as we can make you,\' Dumbledore said. \'I\'ve also asked that a couple of the members of the Order take turns making sure you\'re still safe.\'

*That\'s how he knew I was apparating around last year*.

Harry stifled a brief flare of heat. *Ah well, let them try and find me. I'll*

*be in and out before they can stop me.*

\'When can they first get there?\' he asked.

\'The day after tomorrow.' Dumbledore smiled, inching his hand across the smooth desk surface towards the bowl of sherbet lemons.

*So there'll be plenty of time for me to arrive and leave again.*

*Excellent.*

\'Who will it be?\' Harry stifled a laugh as Fawkes extended a foot in front of the bowl to impede Dumbledore\'s progress.

The old wizard sighed in defeat and looked away from his prized stash of sweets. \'Nymphadora Tonks, Alastor Moody and Hestia Jones are the three who'll spend the most time there, Harry. I must ask you to try and make things easy for us by not apparating off anywhere. Voldemort will be much more active now he\'s been exposed, and you remain, of course, in the forefront of his mind.\'

\'I promise, headmaster,\' Harry said. \'I\'ll stay where I\'m

safest.\'

*The Meadow. Behind my wards. Where Voldemort can't get*

*me. And where you can't dangle me like a worm on a fishing hook.*

'Excellent, Harry.' Dumbledore\'s hand flashed forward and seized the bowl of sherbet lemons. 'I know it must be trying for you to endure the company of your relatives. They are not the most affable of people.\'

Fawkes let out a low cry of mourning and hopped back onto his perch. Harry got the distinct impression the bird was now sulking.

'Was that all, Professor?' Harry asked.

'Not quite, my boy.' Dumbledore adjusted several books on his desk, uncovering a familiar looking tome. 'There're some more pleasant things I'd like to congratulate you on before you head back home.'

*The Secrets of the Darkest Arts*. Harry glanced away from it and admired Fawkes' bright plumage. *So he's been reading about horcruxes, too. Although his version probably doesn't come with helpful, how-to annotations.*

\'So!\' Dumbledore beamed. 'Professor Tofty, an old associate of mine, and some of his colleagues have been most impressed with your performance in your OWLs. I recall a long, interesting conversation about a large raven you transfigured from a desk stealing the wands of other students before eventually dispersing.

Normally, of course, I would frown on such a thing during an exam, but since the fault largely lies with the examiners for not being able to bring themselves to vanish your remarkable piece of magic, I can only congratulate you on your accomplishments. That is well in advance of your studies, Harry. You're going to be remembered as a great wizard one day.\'

*Remembered.* Harry swallowed a lick of heat and pretended no cold fist clenched in his chest. *Remembered for my noble sacrifice, no doubt.*

'Thank you, sir.'

\'I remember performing a similar feat back in my youth. I transfigured a particularly attractive, Chippendale-style chair into a swan. My professor was very impressed, but only up until the moment my creation broke his arm. I had, of course, not accounted for the aggressive nature of the bird.\'

\'Did you get full marks, sir?\' Harry asked.

\'I did. I also received a string of detentions with the Alchemy Professor. I imagine your raven's spate of wand theft will have equally little effect upon your grade, Harry.' Professor Dumbledore steepled his fingers and peered over them at Harry with sharp, bright blue eyes. 'My interest in your skill with Transfiguration is slightly selfish, I\'m afraid. Professor McGonagall has been pressing me heavily to assist her with a personal project of hers for some years, but, alas, I never seem to have the time.\'

Harry laughed. \'I don\'t think I\'d be a suitable replacement for

you, professor.'

\'Have faith in yourself, Harry,\' Dumbledore murmured. \'You're a very powerful wizard. Professor McGonagall has requested my help in her study of her subject not because my skill is any greater than her own, but because she needs a wizard or witch capable of sustaining partial, human transfiguration for a long time that she can then study.\'

\'I\'m only an OWL student, sir.\' Harry shrugged. \'Surely another professor or a seventh year student would be preferable to her.\'

\'Your modesty is admirable, Harry, but you've already accomplished magic the vast majority of witches and wizards can only dream of. You performed an innovative feat of self-

transfiguration last year for the Triwizard Tournament, something I understand Madam Pomfrey was quite horrified by, and I\'m sure you would find Professor McGonagall\'s assistance with any interests in the field quite useful yourself.\' A twinkle appeared in Dumbledore's eyes. \'No doubt the notion of following in your father\'s and Sirius\' examples has occurred to you, my boy.\'

\'Becoming an animagus,\' Harry mused.

*That could be useful. That could be very useful.* Harry allowed a flash of Fleur in the sun to pass before the eye of his mind. *Even if it's just for afterward.*

\'It is quite the useful talent,\' Dumbledore said. \'My brother, Aberforth, is more adept at it than I and takes the form of a quite spectacular billy goat.\'

\'Do you have a form, professor?\' Harry enquired.

\'For all my skill at the subject, I've never found the inclination or need to master it. It is no small project, as those who have undertaken it will tell you.\' He selected a lemon sherbet, unwrapped it with a deft twist, and dropped it onto his tongue. The sweet clicked against his teeth as he wiggled his jaw around. 'Would you be amenable to the idea, Harry?\'

*There's no good reason to refuse, not without raising suspicion. It doesn't seem like much of a trap, either.* He weighed it up. *And if I say yes, maybe it'll be a good moment to ask about my NEWTs.*

\'I suppose I might be,\' Harry said. \'I have a request of my own, actually.\'

\'Oh.\' Dumbledore leant forward. \'Well, you're more than

welcome to another sherbet lemon, Harry.\'

\'I was actually hoping to be able to take some of my NEWTs early, professor,\' Harry said. \'I find myself quite advanced already and still with a whole summer to spend studying.'

\'It\'s not unknown, but it does depend on your results, my boy. Anything less than an outstanding and it would not be encouraged by the faculty. Which subjects were you considering?\'

\'Transfiguration, Charms, Defence, Potions, and Advanced

Arithmancy, sir.'

\'I have heard, from Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall, that you are casting and have been casting some NEWT level spells since your fourth year, non-verbally as well.\' Dumbledore ran a hand along the upper length of his beard, smoothing the silver hairs. \'Defence Against the Dark Arts has always been your best subject, too, but Professor Snape has never intimated any precocious gift for potions, and Professor Vector rarely lets any student take an exam early.\'

\'Is that a no, sir?\' Harry asked.

\'Quite the opposite.\' Dumbledore pulled his fingers from his beard. \'I think it\'s a splendid idea, provided, of course, you can study hard over the summer, but you will need written permission from each teacher for their subject. How early would you like to take them?\'

\'As early as possible,\' Harry said.

*Fleur did it. I can do it. Maybe I'll even beat her. That ought*

*to make her pout.*

\'Next January?\' Dumbledore's fingers stilled. \'That is an

ambitious undertaking, Harry.\'

\'The sorting hat did want to put me in Slytherin,\' Harry murmured.

\'A test, then,\' Dumbledore declared. \'I haven\'t done any teaching in some time and I daresay I could use the practice to keep in touch.\' He reached into the bowl and drew out another sherbet lemon, placing it on the desk between them. \'I would like you to transfigure this into the most complex thing you can think of.\'

Harry stared at the sweet. *Small, inanimate, and technically food.* He flicked his wand into his palm and transfigured the sherbet lemon into a real, smooth-skinned citrus fruit the size of his palm.

\'Very good.\' Dumbledore transfigured it back into a sweet and dropped it into the bowl. \'You chose something difficult, but obtainable. I shall assume you have put the same amount of thought into this choice to take your exams early and allow you to take them early, provided you have that written consent from the teacher of each subject I mentioned before.\'

*Smart test.* A chill trickled down Harry's spine. *And I missed it completely.*

\'Was that all, Harry?\' Dumbledore asked. \'It\'s getting late, and while I assume you will be making the most of your ability to apparate, you will still have to get up early to say goodbye to your friends.\'

Harry allowed himself a small smile and pictured Privet Drive fading into the distance. 'I do have a fair few goodbyes to say, I suppose.'

# Every Portrait that is Painted with Feeling...

Something heavy draped itself across his stomach. Harry snapped his eyes open to blinding brightness and thrust his hand beneath his pillow, curling his fingers 'round his wand. Warmth rushed up his arm.

\'Morning Harry.\' Katie beamed up at him from his abdomen. A bright gleam hovered in her mahogany eyes and her hair spilt over the side of his bed. \'Time to get up.\'

\'Get off.\' He groaned and tensed his stomach, bouncing her head up and down. \'I\'m not even getting the train, remember?\'

\'Oh I know.\' Katie giggled, reaching out a hand and patting him on the head. \'Did you know you've got the best bed hair I\'ve ever seen?\'

\'How did you get in?\' Harry squinted into the bright light shining through his curtains. \'I put a sticking charm on the hangings.\'

\'I noticed.' She waved her wand in the air. \'It took me almost five whole seconds to get in once I lost patience with trying to draw them.\'

\'You wanted to say goodbye again this badly?\' Harry sat up and scooped Katie's head out of his lap. \'Does Alicia know you're in my bed with me?\'

\'Yes.\' Katie smirked. 'I finally convinced her to see sense; it only took until the last hour of our school life together.'

\'Better late than never.\' Harry transfigured his pyjamas into school robes and undid his sticking charm. 'So why *did* you decide to invite yourself into my bed?'

Katie peered around. \'Where is all your stuff? There's

literally nothing in your trunk. Is this even your trunk?\'

\'Around.' Harry yawned. 'And no, it's just a spare one for my pyjamas.'

\'Where\'s everyone else?\' Katie asked.

*You mean you didn't check before jumping in bed with me?*

Harry grimaced. *I hope nobody noticed. That's one rumour I don't need cropping back up. Or getting back to Fleur, somehow.* He shuddered. *She wouldn't be happy at all.*

He plastered a smile over the tight, cold knot in his gut. \'Maybe they all left before they were forced to witness you being murdered for waking me early,\' he said. \'What possessed you to come and disturb me?\'

\'I wanted to say goodbye.\' Katie bounced off the edge of his bed and gazed out at the grey, undecided Scottish sky, fogging the panes with her breath. \'Breakfast?\'

\'Fine.' He groaned and rolled onto his feet. \'Why're you so cheerful? It\'s your last day of school with Angelina and Alicia, I expected you to be moping.\'

\'I know.\' Katie beamed. \'Angelina had to cast a handful of Cheering Charms on me when we woke up so I\'d be less miserable and actually get out of bed. She cast a few too many.' She giggled. \'And then I thought I could come down here to see you and she went to argue with Alicia about something.\'

\'That explains a lot.\' Harry grinned. \'Though not why you thought waking me up was a good idea.\'

\'You get to see me.' She swivelled about. 'I might not be the prettiest witch you've woken up in bed with recently, but I'm your best friend.'

\'Let\'s go to breakfast,\' Harry said. 'Before someone sees you here, some terribly contrived scheme hatches, and we both get immolated by a very feathery Fleur.'

'Feathery?' Katie swatted her brown hair out of her face. 'She has feathers?'

'Sometimes.' Harry chuckled. 'Usually when she's angry at

me.'

'And that happens a lot, does it?' She bit at her lip.

'I have to bribe her with cake.' He shot her a grin. 'It seems

like all the girls I know need to be bribed with something.' Katie laughed. 'She's cheaper than I am.'

Harry rolled his eyes and headed down toward the Great Hall. 'Don't let *her* hear you say that. She's very competitive and Paris probably has some *very* expensive sweets shops.'

Katie bounced alongside him. 'Does that mean I'll get to meet Frenchie?'

He froze. 'Er---'

'Don't worry, Harry. I know that'd probably be super awkward for you.' She laughed and placed one foot right into the trick step. 'I'll keep all our secrets.'

Harry concealed a smile and waited.

'Shit.' Katie tugged at her leg, then reached for her wand. 'Stupid step.'

Harry plucked her wand out of her fingers. 'Now you're

stuck.'

'I'm *completely* at your mercy,' Katie breathed. A wicked

glint appeared in her eyes and she tied her hair into a knot with a slow deliberate twist. 'What do I have to do to get you to free me, Harry?'

He snorted. 'I don't think we'd even have time for anything

like that. Someone'll be coming soon.'

She giggled. 'I bet someone *would* be coming soon.'

Harry rolled his eyes and freed her with a flick of her wand.

'That was awful.'

'You love me.' Katie beamed and skipped down the stairs. 'I

am the light of your life.'

Harry caught her at the tables and dropped her wand into

her lap. 'You might need this.'

'Thanks.' She stuffed it back into her robes. 'You sure you don't want to ride the train with me?'

'It's a long ride,' Harry replied. 'But I'll come see you over the summer. Nev, too.' He moved the goblets out of range of her elbow. 'Are you going to see Alicia and Angelina?'

'At some point. They\'re helping Fred and George with some

enterprise they\'re starting this summer, but I\'m not supposed to tell

you that.\' She scrunched up her face. 'There\'s a lot of things they don\'t want me to tell you, really.'

\'You should probably listen to them,\' Harry said. 'I'm sure I don't want to know whatever girly secrets the three of you have.'

\'I promised.' Katie helped herself to half a plate of bacon and

leant on his shoulder. 'And promises have to be kept.'

*Yes, they do.* Harry glanced down the table to where an irritated Alicia was hissing in Angelina's ear. *I guess someone's realised too many cheering charms probably weren't a good idea.*

\'So what\'re you doing over the summer, Harry?\' Katie asked. \'Not much,\' Harry replied. \'Studying for NEWTs probably

and meeting up with friends.\'

She twisted her lips around. \'Not going to see Fleur?\'

\'Hopefully, I'll be seeing a lot of Fleur.\' Harry flushed at Katie\'s suggestive look. \'And I'll probably be keeping my head down and staying safe. I\'ll be a target now.'

\'You\'ve been a target every year.\' Katie patted him on the cheek, the tips of her fingers brushing the corner of his mouth. \'I don\'t care.\'

\'I\'m still coming incognito when I meet up with you over the summer. Just in case.\'

\'You should bring Frenchie, if she\'s alright with taking the risk,\' Katie said. \'I\'d actually like to meet her at some point. I have so many things to tell her about you.\' A spark of mischief gleamed in her eyes.

Harry chuckled. \'Planning on embarrassing me?\'

'If she's scared off, then you'll focus all your gifts on me.' She beamed. 'I love to be spoilt.'

\'I don\'t think there\'s much you could tell her that would be more embarrassing than what she already knows, but don\'t let me dissuade you.\'

\'You won\'t.\' She grinned and took a large bite of her sandwich.

\'Wonderful.\'

Harry watched the first, most eager students start to head towards the doors and the carriages back to Hogsmeade Station. Katie crammed her bacon sandwich into her mouth and choked, gulping water from Harry\'s cup to get it down.

'You good?' Harry asked.

She gave him a thumbs up, but her gaze drifted toward the leavers and the laughter faded from her eyes.

*The Cheering Charms have worn off.*

More and more students filtered out. Harry glimpsed Nev and Ron among them, the latter jostling with Malfoy when he strayed too close.

Katie threw a glance to where the other two chasers were lingering, then twisted about and pulled him into a tight, warm hug. 'I\'ll see you in the summer, Harry. Any day\'s fine if you want to come visit. My parents own the third café on the left in the southern part of Diagon Alley. It's the one with red umbrellas.\'

\'I\'ll come visit.' He wrapped his arms back 'round her and

gave her a gentle pat on the back when her embrace lingered.

'You promise?' She leant back. 'Don't let Frenchie drag you

off to France the *whole* time and forget your best friend.' 'I promise.'

'I'll be mad if you break it.' Katie waved her fist under his nose and sighed. 'Time to go\... Bye, Harry.'

'Bye, Katie.' Harry watched her back drift out the door

between Angelina and Alicia, waving when she glanced back at him.

*And now it's time to get out of here and away from Privet Drive.* A strange thrill seized him. Scattered flashes of half-desire on empty days amidst his aunt's roses and in the dark beneath the stairs crept up from the back of his mind. *I did it.* A ball of emotion burst with a hot rush strong enough to bring tears to his eyes. *I'm really leaving that place forever.*

He plucked one last slice of toast from the nearest rack and swept out of the hall, pirouetting around Argus Filch who mumbled warnings at him with what was almost a smile upon his lips, and bounding up the stairs three steps at a time.

Myrtle hovered before the taps, little more than a faint outline, as if formed from steam.

'Myrtle.' Harry edged through the puddle. 'Are you okay?'

She swivelled 'round. 'Harry.' A small smile appeared on her

lips. 'For a moment, I thought you were someone else.'

*Tom.* He held his tongue. *You've called me Tom more than*

*once. Was he a friend to you like he was to Ginny?*

'I'm very glad I could help you, Harry.' Myrtle drifted closer and brushed her cold fingertips down his cheek, leaving a trail of pins and needles tingling on his skin. 'I think I'm about to fade.'

'Fade?\' He stared into her eyes. 'That sounds very... *final,*

Myrtle.'

She offered him a trembling smile. 'I --- I'm not feeling so

bad anymore. I did something wrong, before I died, and I couldn't let it go. Like a great weight\...' She touched a finger to her heart. 'Just here. Then you came, feeling so familiar, and I could help you. I feel all light. *Free.*'

*Free to disappear.* Harry smothered the prickle crawling down his spine.

Myrtle watched her fingers fade like smoke into the breeze.

'Bye Harry,' she whispered. 'Bye Tom.'

*Gone.* Harry watched her vanish. *Just like that. Here one moment, then nothing forever.* He stifled a ripple of revulsion and the soft wrench of horror in his heart. *It's what she wanted. No regrets.*

\'Open.' He drifted down the stairs into the chamber, listening to the echo of his footsteps across the main hall, and opened the door into the study. 'I'm back.'

\'So you are,\' Salazar murmured, petting his serpent as it buried its blunt nose into his neck. \'I have a story for you today.\'

Harry settled himself down in front of the desk. \'What\'s it

about?\'

'Death.'

He twitched. 'Are there ghosts?'

'Not of the sort *you* mean.' Salazar's eyes swam with shadows. 'You'll understand after you hear it.'

Harry leant back in the chair and straightened the stacks of

books on the desk. 'Alright then.'

'I heard several sensible variations, all millennia old by the time I was born,\' Salazar said. 'They started with a witch and her younger brother. The witch, whose name has been lost to history, all but raised her younger brother after their parents died. She turned out to be quite a gifted witch, and, once her brother was old enough to remain at home alone, travelled the country crafting wands and other objects for the wealthy. Eventually, she was asked to create an artefact of incredible power, a mirror that would create a perfect, permanent copy of any object it reflected.\'

\'That sounds like something that should not have been made lightly,\' Harry said.

'It's hard to resist the temptation to do something great with the gifts we're given,' Salazar murmured. 'It took the witch many attempts to craft the mirror, working in secret so as not to advertise her project, but when she was successful she left her brother behind and went to present it to the wizard who had commissioned it. This wizard was very pleased with her creation, but, fearing she might create another, ordered her killed, and the witch was executed.'

Harry grimaced. 'What happened to her brother?'

\'That is the true story.\' A thin, cool smile curved Salazar's lips. 'He grew up determined to have his revenge and find a way to bring his sister back.\'

'How could she be brought back?' Harry asked. 'She's dead.'

*do that?*

*Can magic do that?* He buried a surge of bright hope. *Could I*

\'Many things once considered impossible have become

possible through magic,\' Salazar said. \'He planned and studied for decades, hiding his vengeful ambition, for the wizard with the mirror had used it to become very powerful. The brother married, had and raised his children, but never forgot his goal. He crafted a wand to take his revenge, a wand more powerful than anything any other wielded. It was rumoured he was so bent on his revenge that he invoked the power of death itself to craft it, trading his own soul in return.\'

\'That sounds unbelievable,\' Harry said.

\'I suspect he just crafted a very powerful wand,\' Salazar said. 'Nonetheless, he was not satisfied, because one wand against all the power of the wizard\'s followers would not be enough. He went further, crafting a cloak to let him sneak into the wizard\'s castle undetected, a cloak supposedly powerful enough to hide him completely.\'

*Like mine.* Harry threw a glance at the folded silver surface of his own invisibility cloak.

\'I see you have guessed at some of the relevance of this story.\' A small, proud smile turned the corners of Salazar's mouth up. \'I knew you would.' He tapped his wand against his palm, sending silver sparks showering down into the base of his frame. 'The younger brother slipped into the castle under his cloak, killed the wizard, destroyed the mirror his sister made and left. However, his desire to bring her back had only grown over the years and his vengeance was no longer enough. At the advice of his wife and children he created a stone, one with the power to show him the dead, so that he could prove his quest was not impossible. It showed him his sister, drawing her from whatever comes after death, but her

existence was not true enough and, determined to bring her back in full, he created one last artefact.\'

A faint, ominous chill fell upon Harry. \'This doesn't sound

like a happy story. Why're you telling it?\'

\'You\'ll understand soon. The last thing he made was a gate, a veiled archway into the realm of death itself. He intended to enter and return with his sister. The younger brother left the first three things he had made in the hands of his three children, the wand to the eldest, the cloak to his youngest, and the stone to the middle child, who'd lost his daughter to disease, then went to find his sister. His family waited.They waited for many years, his wife died, but their father never returned---'

\'Is this a warning?\' Harry raised an eyebrow. 'Or are you telling me I could use these artefacts to kill Voldemort?'

'Don't interrupt, brat,' Salazar snapped. 'Godric died trying to

recover a wand for an old wizard by the name of Ignatius Peverell. Peverell claimed the wand was an heirloom that'd been stolen from him, but Godric believed the myth and wanted to remove such a dangerous weapon from the world. After my wife died, I came across his notes on the three artefacts, deciding, against logic, to search for the stone that might let me see my wife once more. I never found it and the Peverells denied its existence. My daughter was certain they were lying.\'

\'And the cloak?\' Harry tugged his cloak onto his lap and ran his fingertips over the material.

Salazar stroked the side of his thumb along his serpent's spine. 'I suspect the Peverell family somehow found the wand, the stone and the cloak, encouraging the belief of myths and legends to conceal the truth of their existence and to increase their own reputation. The more outlandish tales claimed the three sons earnt

them from Death itself. The only shred of proof I have is that they changed their sigil from a thestral rampant to a curious symbol sometime after Rome's Emperor bestowed them with lands in Britain. Does your cloak have a mark on it?'

Harry unfolded the cloak, running his eyes over each inch. \'What am I looking for?\'

'A triangle, divided in half by a line and encasing a circle.\'

Harry pored over the cloak until a faint gleam of silver a few shades darker than the rest caught his eye. He pulled it beneath the light. A triangle, circle, and line shone upon the garment. Ice trickled through his veins.

'It\'s true.' Harry glanced up at Salazar and held up the marked cloak. 'The sigil's on here. It's Grindelwald's mark, I saw it on the graves at Godric's Hollow, and *I\'ve seen the doorway*, it\'s in the Department of Mysteries now.'

Salazar's forehead creased. 'Then it's likely the other artefacts exist, too. I was confident, but never quite certain. I can't say how much truth is in old stories, Harry. The chance of finding them after all these years is next to nothing.'

\'Why are you telling me, then?\' Harry demanded.

\'Because it's time to reseal the Chamber of Secrets. If there are other descendants among your generations, they have not found me and nor does it seem likely they will. We will reseal the chamber so its wards are tied to your blood descendants.'

Harry glanced at his cloak. 'The sacrifice. I need to know

how valuable the cloak is to use it.\'

'No,' Salazar murmured. 'In the end, the cloak means little to you. Useful, but the desperate affection you had for anything connected to lost parents has faded just like Tom's did.'

Harry frowned. 'So how *do* I seal it?\'

\'I tied the wards here to my bloodline and the sacrifice my wife and I had already made to aid them.' Salazar sighed and cupped his serpent's head against his breast. \'You have no such sacrifice to tie the wards to.\'

'Have I not given enough?' Harry clenched his fists. 'What else is there for me to give?'

Salazar shook his head. 'I have spent a long time considering this, it was necessary the moment Voldemort returned, and I have decided what has to happen.'

'So *what's the price?*' Harry demanded.

His mind raced. *Something to keep Voldemort out.* A silver- haired, emerald-eyed little girl smiled at him from within her mother's embrace and his heart lurched. *Something that will help my family forever.*

\'Something that feels almost invaluable,\' Salazar whispered.

'Something so precious you might not survive without it.\'

*Fleur.* Harry\'s heart froze and his breath caught.

The world spun around him until he clawed back a gasp of

air.

'I won\'t.' He shook his head and his wand flashed ice cold

against his skin. 'I can't. I couldn't. *Never.*'

\'Not her,\' Salazar murmured. \'I would never ask you to do that. The answer is staring you in the face, Harry. I'm not, as you once so tactfully told me, Salazar Slytherin, just an imprint of him on canvas. No lives need be wasted when I will suffice.'

\'But I need you.'

'Tom had me and it didn't stop him. No, there's no other choice, Harry. It must be me.'

\'I won\'t ever be able to speak to you again,\' Harry

whispered. 'Every time I come down here, it'll just be a hollow hall.'

Salazar sighed. 'Do you need me more than you need *her*,

Harry? It must be me, because if it's not me...'

Harry wrestled with the cage of thorns around his heart. 'It

--- it can't be her.'

'Then it must be me.' Salazar offered him a faint smile and studied his wand. 'Perhaps, Harry, you'll be fortunate enough to stumble across a way to speak to me again. I may have other portraits still surviving somewhere, dormant, until those of my blood discover them.'

*He's lying.* Harry swallowed a bitter lump. Cold, hollow talons clawed at him within. *He knows this is the only one. I'll have to find that stone to ever speak with him again.*

'What do I have to do?' he whispered.

'The runes for the wards are inscribed in the patterns of the snakes\' scales in the main chamber, both the effigies and across the ceiling, you need only go over them with your magic and add your blood.\'

\'Shall I carry you outside?\' Harry offered.

Salazar smirked. \'Just levitate me out.'

A faint stab of humour pierced through the abyss. 'I knew I should've actually tried. There never was any sort of charm, was there?'

'If it makes you feel better, Tom never realised either and he

was carrying me around for twice as long as you were.\'

\'I wouldn\'t have minded carrying you about a little longer,\' Harry murmured.

\'The things that are necessary are not always easy,\' Salazar replied. \'Besides, I've lingered in this chamber for long enough. My friends have left no imprints of themselves to keep me company.\'

Harry set him down at the centre of the chamber, using a sticking charm to keep the frame of the canvas upright, and traced over the runes within the pattern of the scales with purple flame. Eventually, he stood at the centre of a web of shimmering purple fire, bathed in a bright violet glow.

\'You\'ll need a few extra ones now,\' Salazar said. 'Make it

yours.'

Harry scanned the lines of twisting, shining runes, then, at

the ceiling\'s centre, etched a few, simple glyphs with a shaking hand.

'Are you sure there's no other way?'

\'I am,\' Salazar whispered. \'I would not leave you to face Voldemort without me if there were a better option. If we leave this entrance open, he will tear through this place without warning. We made this place to be a haven, and it must remain one, for you and for all children.'

'Can I not just intend...? Somehow?'

\'It would not be the same if you knew you might circumvent the price,\' Salazar murmured. \'You know this.\'

\'How?\' Harry swallowed the hot lump in his throat and clenched his jaw. The tears prickling in his eyes persisted.

\'Do it quickly. I will feel no pain, but it will be easier for you.'

*It has to be done.* Harry wrestled with it. *I can't leave or Dumbledore will come after me. It can't stay unprotected or Voldemort will come here.*

He levelled his wand at the painting. Weak, pale, yellow flames burst from its tip and guttered out.

'It is hard, Harry,' Salazar whispered. 'But you endured before. You can endure again. You will not be alone so long as you have her.'

Harry hardened his heart*. It's the only way. He has to be destroyed.*

Fiendfyre flooded from his wand, coiling into the shape of the basilisk; it lunged, closing its fangs over Salazar, then Harry squashed it from existence.

*Hogwarts will be safe. I will be safe.* He sliced open the ball of his thumb and spattered a few drops of blood onto the floor at his feet. *Fleur will be safe.*

The Chamber of Secrets lurched, trembling as if caught in an earthquake. The runes flared bright as sunlight, pulsing in time with the beat of Harry's heart until his head span; then he was plunged into the dark.

*It's done.* A faint hope rose up in the quiet blackness.

'Salazar?' Harry whispered.

The chamber echoed his voice back at him, over and over, until the murmurs faded into thick, dense silence. A thin, fragile bubble held a swirling vortex of emotion prisoner in his heart.

'Gone.'

The bubble wavered, his wand flared hot and cold in his hand and the darkness curled 'round him, deep and hollow as the emptiness within. Harry pictured the hall of the Meadow and wrenched the world back past him.

Fleur's soft humming drifted from the lounge.

He stumbled toward it, blinking back tears. Raw, hot, bitter feeling howled in his heart and Harry clamped his mouth shut before its scream spilt through his lips.

'Harry?' She reached out and drew him down onto the sofa next to her as his tears began to trickle down his cheeks. 'What's wrong?'

Harry shook his head, wrapped his arms 'round her and pulled her close until the soft warmth of her and the sweet scent of marzipan and burnt holly blotted out the world.

Fleur cradled his head in her lap. 'You'll survive, monCœur.' She ran her fingers through his hair and pressed a soft kiss to his forehead. 'I'm still here. And I'm never going anywhere.'

# Ignorance is Bliss

Summer sun soaked into him, shining through the soft green leaves of the willow tree. Their fronds tangled 'round him like a hundred slim snakes. Somewhere beyond the green and the bright, the river burbled and gushed over warm, white stones.

'Perfect,' Harry murmured.

Arms slipped around his shoulders from behind. 'As always,' Fleur whispered in his ear. 'And one day, this will be every day.'

The sun wavered, the warmth faded, and Harry opened his eyes. A silver blanket covered him to the faded green arm of the old sofa beyond his toes and Fleur's warm thigh rested beneath his cheek.

The deep, cold ache crept back in where the warmth of the willow tree had been.

She brushed his hair off his face. \'Did you sleep well,

monCœur?\'

'Yes.' He shot her a small smile. 'Kind of wish I didn't have to wake up.'

Fleur's blue eyes held his gaze and she traced the line of dried tears down his cheeks with her fingertip. 'Will you tell me? Will that help?'

\'I don\'t know. Has it ever helped you?\'

\'Sometimes,\' she murmured, running her hands through his

hair. 'It seems to help Gabby.'

'I had to seal the Chamber of Secrets,\' Harry said. \'All of the wards bound to Salazar's blood had to be altered so that I and those of my bloodline can still enter, but Voldemort can\'t. I had to sacrifice someone invaluable to demonstrate intent strong enough to create such an incredible piece of magic.'

\'Someone?\' Fleur's hands froze in his hair and her breath

caught.

\'Salazar,\' Harry mumbled into her leg. \'He said there was no

other way.\'

*It was him or you.* His heart twisted itself into a tight knot.

*And it can't be you. It can't ever be you.*

\'I\'m sure that he was right,\' Fleur whispered.

\'I needed him. Without him I'd still be blindly walking to my death, just as Dumbledore plans. Now he's gone...\'

'But I am not.\' Fleur lifted his head off her legs and squirmed. \'You will always have me, monCœur.\' She kissed him on the cheek, then turned his head to face her with two slender fingers on his chin.

\'It hurts.\' Harry pressed his fingers to the point in his chest where the ache was almost tangible.

'It always does.' Fleur rested her head on his shoulder. 'But it will pass. What's done is done.'

*But it can be undone.* The silver mark on his cloak, the faded, black symbol upon the white graves at Godric's Hollow and the mark above the Veil hovered before the eye of Harry's mind. *I can undo it.*

\'There *is* something I can do.' Hope flared anew. 'I can see him again.'

'How, monCœur?' A small, worried gleam hovered in her eyes. 'He is gone.'

\'There is a stone. An artefact that can raise an imprint of the

dead.\'

Fleur sighed and stood. \'I know the story. The three

brothers, the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and Death\'s Cloak. It is a myth.' She fingered her wand. 'We don't have time for you to try and convince me, either. It's time for us to find our own way or make one.'

*Privet Drive.*

Harry sprang to his feet. 'I need to go.'

Fleur led him to the kitchen. 'I am coming and you are eating

something first.\'

*She can't come to that place.* Harry struggled with the two images, but no mental contortion he could manage would force the picture of Fleur into that house. *She shouldn't be there. It's wrong.*

\'There isn\'t time,\' Harry said. \'And if the members of the Order are there, then they can't see you.\'

\'Why not?\' Fleur tossed her hair over her shoulder and rummaged through the cupboards. 'I do not care if they know we are together, in fact, I would prefer it if they did.'

'But you'd be a target.' Harry's heart seized. 'They'd try to

take you *away*.'

'I will be under the Fidelius. Safe as can be.'

'And Gabby?' Harry tried. 'What about when Voldemort goes looking for our secret keeper knowing of your link to me? Will your family be safe?'

Fleur whirled on him. 'He will never reach my sister when she is behind the walls of Beauxbatons. Voldemort will not dare risk provoking France\'s enmity while he still struggles in Britain.' Her eyes darkened to pitch black. 'And if you try to use my sister to manipulate me into hiding away like some shallow, little trophy of a girl again, then you will regret it, monCœur. I will fight or I may as well return to France.\'

*She knows me.* Harry's heart sank down into the pit of his

stomach. *I can't lose her.*

Fleur's expression softened and her eyes faded back to summer sky blue. 'You didn't fall in love with some silly little girl who wanted to wait for her hero to save everyone, then sweep her off her feet into the sunset. You fell in love with *me*.' She tilted her chin into the air. 'And so you will have to get used to the idea of me being me all the time, not just when it's convenient.'

'I know,' Harry murmured. 'But---'

'In the end, they'll all find out,' she said. 'Are you ashamed to be seen with me?'

\'Of course not,\' Harry said. 'Who could be?'

\'Then why should I hide?\' Fleur returned to rummaging and

passed him a rather flat, battered croissant. \'It was under the jam.'

'Thanks.' Harry peeled layers off the pastry and chewed. 'Is there really nothing I can say or do that would change your mind, mon Rêve?'

'Is there anything I could say to you that would keep you from helping me?' Fleur demanded, crossing her arms and narrowing her eyes. 'The answer to that better be no.'

'Of course it is,' he whispered. 'But I, well, you know I'm a bit

weird, Fleur. I can't lose you. I'd do *anything* to stop that.'

A small soft smile spread across Fleur's lips. 'I know.' She stole the last piece of croissant from his hand and ate it with a small smirk. 'Now, we need to go. I *very* much want to meet your family.'

*No you don't.* Harry caught the darkening hue of her eyes and the faint pinpricks of white along her arms. *Or maybe you do.*

\'Well, if you get attached to any of them, I\'m prepared to

trade for Gabby.'

\'That bad?\' Fleur arched an eyebrow.

'Gabby at her most mischievous is a thousand times preferable to any of my relatives.\' Harry chuckled. \'Let alone all of them together.'

Fleur huffed. 'You can't fool me, monCœur. You *encourage*

her.'

'I do.' Harry grinned. 'You make the most adorable pout

when you get teased.'

A faint blush rose onto Fleur's cheeks. \'You might change your mind about that now we're both the target. I told her that we\'d, well, *you know*, and now I can\'t say anything about you to her without getting suggestive looks and cheeky remarks.'

'She did that already.' Harry extended an arm.

She draped his arm across her shoulders and wrapped her own arm around his waist. 'Shall we go? It\'s time for Harry to fly the nest.'

\'Bird references?\' Harry raised an eyebrow. \'*You\'re* making bird references about *me?*\'

She laughed. \'Hush and apparate us, monCœur.'

Harry shifted their weight forwards, apparating them both straight into the back garden of Number Four, Privet Drive.

Fleur lifted her wand from her waist. \'Homenumrevelio.

Only three people are close enough to the house to see us.'

\'Perhaps my intended baby-sitter isn't here yet.\' Relief flooded through Harry's chest and a smile crept onto his lips.

'Don't look so pleased.' Fleur huffed. 'I am not some secret to be hoarded away from the world. You don't shut perfect things away in the dark where you can't appreciate them, monCœur.'

Harry apparated them both upstairs to his room with a soft snap, disentangling himself from Fleur to gather his things into a small stack. He shrank it down with a flick of his wand and slipped the whole pile into his pocket.

\'You don\'t have very many things,\' she murmured.

\'My relatives are not overly zealous about spending money

on me.'

\'I can see that.\' Heat haze shimmered around Fleur's palms

and her eyes flashed dark as pitch. 'So *this* is the sort of distant, empty place that leaves a child so alone he begins to wonder if he's even real.'

Harry flinched. 'I---'

Fleur pressed a finger to his lips. 'I don't care.' She kissed him on the cheek and turned his lips to hers. Her black eyes burnt a finger's length from his. 'You are *mine* now, despite what they did, maybe even *because* of what they did, but that doesn't mean I won't hate them for hurting you.'

'It didn't hurt at the time. I just wasn't really there.' Harry stared down at the close-trimmed lawns and roses. 'I don't even remember most of it. It feels almost like a dream.'

\'Are we going downstairs?\' Fleur asked.

\'Will you promise not to do anything drastic?\' \'What are *you* going to do?'

Harry studied the fierce glint in her black eyes. *And I'm going to have to do something.* A quiet satisfaction rose in him. *I owe them eleven years of emptiness. They deserve a parting gift.*

\'I\'m going to give them the same safety and security from the magical world that they gave me,' he said.

Fleur tilted her head to one side and nodded. \'I promise.\'

Harry strode out over the creaking floorboards of the landing and down the stairs.

\'I think *he\'s* back.\' Petunia's prim tone and sharp sniff drifted

up from the living room.

He stepped through the door. \'I am indeed back.'

The muted television played an endless sequence of bizarre events. Familiar potted, plastic plants squatted on the window and in

the corners, flowery wallpaper spread beneath the swirl-patterned plaster ceiling, and the same collection of photos of the three Dursleys hung on the walls.

\'Well things aren\'t going to be the same as last summer,\'

Vernon blustered, heaving himself out of his chair. 'Your aunt and I---'

'Mais bien sûr.' Fleur stepped through the door after him. 'As if I would leave Harry to endure another day in this tasteless, lifeless hovel with you.'

Petunia's hands darted to her hair and curled into her pockets. \'Who is this, Harry?'

'Fleur Delacour.' Fleur glanced between the three Dursleys.

'I am with Harry.'

Dudley gawped. 'With Harry?\'

Harry snorted. \'Well, Duddikins, when a boy and a girl love each other very much, they become partners. If you keep eating your grapefruit, you might even find out for yourself one day.'

\'You\'re *married?\'* Petunia gasped and her gimlet eyes peered at Fleur\'s fingers.

*What?*

Fleur raised her fingers and waggled them. 'No ring.'

\'I\'m not even sixteen until the end of the month,\' Harry said. \'Lily married young,\' Petunia said. \'Your kind have all sorts of

strange ways.\'

\'Why\'re you going out with Harry?\' Dudley demanded. \'You\'re, like, a model.\'

\'You think I\'m attractive?\' Fleur's eyes flashed dark as ink. \'Yeah...\' Dudley gaped. 'You're *so* hot.'

Fleur's face shifted and her nose and chin jutted into a cruel, hooked beak. \'How about now?\' she hissed.

Vernon swore and recoiled into his chair, Petunia let out an odd little shriek, covering her mouth with both hands, and Dudley went pale as a sheet.

\'That\'s it,\' Vernon shouted, turning an interesting shade of puce. \'I won\'t have this anymore.\'

\'Oh?\' Harry raised an eyebrow at him. \'What do you intend to do, Vernon?\'

\'I\'ll --- I\'ll...' Vernon caught Petunia's warning glare and

deflated like a punctured balloon.

\'It\'s nice to meet you, Fleur.' Petunia simpered. 'Can I get you anything? A cup of tea?'

Fleur let her face shift back and smirked. 'I've already got the only thing I'd ever want to take from this place.'

A small smile crept onto Harry's face and his heart squirmed in his breast. 'We're not staying long.'

\'You\'re not?\' Dudley dragged his eyes away from Fleur's legs. 'Why not?'

\'I came back to say goodbye. I\'m leaving.\' Harry grinned and raised his hands when Petunia opened her mouth. \'I know it\'s sooner than you expected and I\'m sure you\'ll all miss me *terribly*, but we\'ve got our own house now and I did promise Albus Dumbledore I would stay where I was safest.\'

Vernon bristled, drawing himself up in triumph as the idea that Harry would be gone sank in past the sarcasm.

\'But the protections,\' Petunia squeaked. 'If you\'re gone,

there\'s nothing keeping us safe from your kind.\'

Harry offered a small, thin, cold smile. \'Don\'t fret, Petunia. I\'m going to make sure you\'re every bit as prepared for the magical world as I was.\'

Vernon released a long sigh and slumped back into his

chair. 'Least you could do after we took you in, boy.'

Petunia shivered. \'What are you going to *do*?\'

\'You know what they say, Petunia. Ignorance is bliss.\' Harry flicked out his wand and turned toward Dudley and Vernon. \'Obliviate.' He ripped himself and all magic from their memories, then smoothed Dudley's friends into the gaps left behind.

\'What did you do?\' Petunia shook Vernon's shoulders, then Dudley's. 'Did you *hurt* them?'

\'I modified their memories,\' Harry said. \'They have no memory of me, magic, or anyone connected to me, and in a moment, neither will you.\'

\'What about Lily?\' Petunia whispered. \'Will I still remember my little sister?\'

'You\'ll never even know you had one.'

\'But our childhood together, all the happy times I have from before she left me, they\'d be gone.\' Tears smeared the precise lines of Petunia's eyeshadow and mascara. \'I *loved* my perfect baby sister.\'

\'It never sounded like it to me.\' Harry turned his wand on her. \'Obliviate.\'

Petunia slumped on top of her spouse.

\'What now?\' Fleur watched Harry levitate them back into their usual chairs.

\'We walk away.\' He slipped his wand back into his sleeve. \'Dumbledore or someone from the Order will come here when they realise I am gone, and my memory charm may be weakened by their enquiry, but I doubt it. For all Petunia's proclamations of love, they just won't *want* to remember me.\'

\'And what if Voldemort comes?\'

\'Then they have every protection from him that they afforded me,\' Harry whispered. \'And I suspect he won\'t bother saying more than a very specific couple of words to mere muggles.\'

*They're not worth hating. Just like all the other selfish hypocritical people who begged for a hero, then loathed him for not vanishing after they were saved.* Harry took one last long look around. *I have Fleur now. She's all I'll ever need.*

Fleur's eyes remained dark blue. 'I hope they're not as lucky

as you were.\'

\'I should thank them, really.\' Harry kissed her on the nose and smiled at her glower. 'Without them, I might not've ended up with you.'

\'You would've loved me anyway.\' Fleur slipped her fingers through his. 'I am perfect for you, non?'

'As always,' he murmured.

Privet Drive twisted and Harry found himself spilling across the hall floor in the Meadow. Fleur draped herself over him.

\'You did that deliberately,' he accused through a smile.

Fleur sat up and straddled him with a smirk, leaning back until he could feel the heat of her through his clothes. \'Shall I show you the house?\'

\'Is there anything to see yet?' Harry tried to ignore the

warmth of her pressed against him.

She rolled her hips over him until a groan slipped from his lips. 'The bedroom?' Desire smouldered in her blue eyes, then she vanished. Something soft and warm slid over Harry's face.

He pulled it away and sat up. Fleur's clothes pooled on the floor around him. Dark blue silk lace dangled from his fingers. 'That seems like an *excellent* place to start.'

# The Unyielding Shield

The leaves of the elm trees whispered in the wind as the sun set beyond them in a wash of orange, pink, and red light.

Swathes of meadow grass rippled like waves on the sea, glistening with dew. Harry waded toward the sunset with a broad smile on his face.

*He's not stopped smiling since we left that awful house.* Fleur quickened her pace to return to his side; a damp chill soaked through to her toes and legs, drenching her dress from the knees. *He will never go back there, not if I have any say in it.*

Harry paused at the bank of a small stream and turned his small half-smile on her, reaching for her hand. Fleur's heart squirmed beneath her breast and she slipped her fingers through his.

He pointed their linked hands at the crest of the woods where the trees' green melted into the bright sunset. \'That's as far as it goes?\'

'Yes.'

\'It\'s quite a lot of meadow.' He glanced back over the long grass to where the white-washed walls of their small house sat at the top of the hill. 'I quite enjoy walking through long grass. Vernon always made me cut the grass very short.'

A faint pout crept onto her lips. \'More wet grass than I

would ever care to walk through.'

Harry laughed. \'We can apparate back, mon Rêve, but I was

going to suggest creating some wards.'

\'Across the whole area?\' Fleur swept her hair over her shoulder and studied the meadows. 'It's not a small space...'

\'Of course,\' Harry said. \'It's all *ours*.\'

\'I can do it.' Fleur turned her nose up at him. \'If you watch, you might learn something, monCœur.\'

\'I thought you didn't like being watched?\' Harry teased.

\'I make an exception for you.' Fleur stole a kiss from him and pushed her chest out just enough to catch his eye. 'You can watch me as much as you like.'

\'What will you show me?\' A teasing glint hovered in his eye.

'Something... *exciting?*'

A faint heat crept to her cheeks. \'Warding, in its most common form, *then* something exciting.\'

\'Oh?\' The little gleam in his eye started to smoulder. 'And what's my role in this? Helpless innocent wizard ensnared in the woods and seduced by the wiles of the veela?'

A soft chuckle escaped Fleur's lips, but the heat in her cheeks crept south and curled in her abdomen. '*Maybe*... but not today. Today: wards. They're *not* going to find you and force you back to that ugly little house with your relatives.'

A flicker of disappointment crossed Harry's face and warmth burst beneath Fleur's breast. She pressed her lips to his cheek. 'We've all summer to enjoy each other's company,' she murmured. 'But I want to cross off all the rooms *inside* the house before we move outside.'

Harry laughed. 'Now that's a plan *I can get behind*.'

'You better.' Fleur offered him her cutest pout. 'Now, let's sort out some wards before you distract me any more than you already have.'

Harry's brow creased. 'We don't want anyone turning up

before we can at least prepare ourselves or slip away.'

Fleur pulled her wand out. 'Anti-apparition and anti-portkey wards are a must, then we\'ll need actual protections to stop people just walking up to the door.\'

\'Anything I can help with?\' Harry asked.

Fleur arched an eyebrow at him. \'Not unless you\'ve managed to learn a great deal about enchanting and warding in the last few months?\'

\'I can\'t say that I have.\' Harry's green eyes sparkled with amusement and his gaze trailed down through her cleavage to her hips. \'I suppose I'll just have to watch you.\'

A little shiver rippled through her and she curled her toes into her damp shoes. 'Stop that.' She pouted and turned her back on him. 'I need to focus.'

He stepped close behind her. His warm breath brushed the nape of her neck. 'If you want me to stop, you probably shouldn't pout like that...'

Fleur reached over her shoulder and patted him in the face with her hand. 'Be good. The ward I'm about to cast isn't something most people can manage.' A touch of pride coloured her tone.

Harry's arms slid 'round her waist. 'Astound me, then, mon

Rêve.'

Fleur closed her eyes, gathered her magic, thrust her wand

into the air and twisted. \'Fiantoduri.'

A crackling, glowing beam of bright light burst into the sky. The torrent of magic rose almost a hundred feet into the air before tendrils spread away from its tip like the petals of a vast flower. They arced upwards, feeding the spreading, translucent barrier growing above their heads.

Fleur inspected it and let the feel of the magic wash through her. 'Perfect.' A slow, deep ache crept upon her as the magic took its toll.

'As always,' Harry murmured in her ear. 'Does that mean I

can *distract* you now?'

\'I need to do it on the other side.' Fleur pointed her wand at where the edge of the barrier slowed to a crawl halfway back to the house. 'But first I need to do the other wards.'

'How do they work?' Harry asked.

\'Anti-apparition wards are easy enough,\' she said. \'Do you know what apparition is?\'

\'Probably not in enough detail to understand your explanation of the ward,' he said.

\'Madame Maxime told me that apparition was like travelling from one edge of a piece of paper to the other by magically folding up all the paper in between until the distance between the two edges was a single step.\'

\'Salazar told me that it was like spinning the distance past me as I stepped,\' Harry murmured.

\'Perhaps there are different ways to apparate.\' Fleur shrugged. \'But both methods involve using magic to manipulate the space in between the beginning and end of the journey.\'

'How can you prevent that?\' Harry enquired.

\'The ward I am about to cast prevents any manipulation of space or distance around its edge. If someone tries to compress the space, my ward tries to stretch it back. Nobody can apparate across the border without breaking the ward.\'

\'That\'s quite simple.'

\'It is one of the most basic wards.\' Fleur flicked her wand and a brief shimmer fell over the meadows and house. \'It can be overpowered by compressing the space either side of it until the ward itself covers so little space it is ineffective, but that's no easy feat and beyond most wizards or witches.\'

\'Voldemort did that,\' Harry said. \'He broke the anti- apparition wards over the Ministry.\'

\'He is a powerful wizard. These wards, even my Unyielding Shield Charm, won't keep a wizard like him out if he really wanted to get in, but I\'m sure it would tire even Voldemort.\'

\'Could *you* break through?\'

'Of course.' Fleur waved her wand at the fading shimmer of the anti-apparition wand. 'I can rearrange wards like this, re-enchant them, if you like, but most would struggle. The Unyielding Shield is another matter, it repels all magic, even attempts to change it, and while I could exhaust it, that would also exhaust me.'

Harry opened his mouth, but Fleur put a finger to his lips.

'Anti-portkey wards before I try and explain that ward.'

\'How do *they* work?\'

*You just like listening to me talk, don't you?* Fleur caught the small smile hovering on his lips and her heart lurched. *I could probably spend an hour describing Beauxbatons's different carpets and you'd sit there smiling.*

\'If you imagine the same piece of paper as before, then instead of folding it many times, the portkey bends the paper so that the points are next to each other on opposite sides of the paper. It then pokes a small, temporary hole through the surface of the paper to join the points, and that is what the user travels through.\'

Harry's forehead furrowed. 'I don't understand how you can make a hole? Or how you could stop it?'

Fleur smirked. 'You just do.'

Harry rolled his eyes at her and grinned. 'It's a good thing I've got you to do this for me, then.'

Fleur gathered her magic and raised her wand; it glimmered with turquoise light. 'To prevent someone from making a hole for a portkey, you make the paper tougher. The more magic, the harder it is for the portkey to make the hole.'

*And if you layer the magic in the right patterns, you can make it strong enough that it's all but impossible for anyone but the strongest wizards. Portkeys are blunt pieces of magic.*

Fleur cast a web of magic across their property, folding and twisting it over and over until a thick mesh of her power covered the whole thing. An odd, cyan tint filled the air, then faded away as the ache settled deeper and her legs shook.

Harry took some of her weight and drew her back against his chest. \'Will you be okay?\'

\'I\'ll be fine. Very tired, especially after adding the other enchantments, but fine.\' Fleur leant her head back on his shoulder. 'So you won't be able to *distract* me.'

Harry tutted. 'How disappointing. What's the point of being with a part-veela, sex-craving bird-witch if you can't screw her all the time?'

Fleur huffed. 'You are lucky I know you know better and

have to finish the wards or I would burn your clothes off---' 'Sounds good to me---\'

'And leave you out here in the cold,' Fleur finished. 'Sounds less good.'

'Exactement.' Fleur twisted 'round in his arms and buried her face in his shoulder, breathing in his soft scent. 'Now apparate me over there, monCœur, and I will finish the Unyielding Shield Charm.'

'As you wish, ma Princesse.'

The world spun back past them.

*It is different. Harry whirls the world to meet him, compressing his destination to him for an instant, whereas I crumple the points together*.

Fleur swayed, but Harry's arms pulled her back against the heat of his body. \'You'll have to take me back to the house after this. I might not even be able to stay awake.\'

\'Do you want me to cast it?\' Harry stared up at the bright, glowing flower of magic that shone above the house. 'Would I be able to?'

\'I don't have time to teach you. And the protection will be better if I cast both halves.' She pulled herself upright and stepped away. 'Besides, I'm better at wards than you, so this is *my* part to play.\'

A small smile crept onto Harry's lips and he stepped after her to wrap his arms around her waist. \'In case you fall,\' he murmured into her hair.

\'Fiantoduri.' Fleur thrust her wand skyward, pushing every

drop of magic she had through it, then twisted.

A second torrent of magic erupted from the tip of her wand, crackling and sparking as it ascended into the dusk sky. The two vast flowers of her magic melded together with a faint shimmer, then the stems fed into the translucent shield and the whole thing faded from sight.

Fleur groaned as the toll sapped the strength from her, and

sagged back into Harry's arms.

\'Back to the house with you.\' Harry bent and swept her up into his arms. 'A good thing we're under the Fidelius, or that piece of magic would've had every auror in the country here.'

'It wouldn't have mattered.' Fleur leant her head against his shoulder and closed her eyes. 'I will have to keep reinforcing it to keep it at full strength, but it's the sort of ward that can stop entire squads of aurors in their tracks. I had to steal a book from Madame Maxime's private collection to learn it.'

'What a brilliant, devious, accomplished bird-witch you are.'

Harry laid her down on the sofa, then disappeared into the kitchen.

Fleur listened to the creak of cupboards and the clink of china, settled herself into the cushions and smiled. 'I'll make you regret those bird-witch comments, monCœur.'

Harry's footsteps returned. 'You'll never make me regret any time I spend with you.'

Fleur wrestled with the weight of her eyelids, cracking one

eye open. 'What're you up to?'

Harry lifted her head, sat down, then rested her back onto his lap and waved the last piece of the religieuse under her nose. 'I'm going to eat your cake while you're too tired to stop me.'

'You better not,' Fleur muttered. 'Or this part-human, sex- craving bird-witch is going to set you on fire and peck out your eyes.'

Harry laughed and bent to kiss her on the forehead. \'Can you sit up? Or shall I feed you?\'

Fleur's stomach squirmed and she curled her toes into the cushions. Her tired mind conjured fragmented images of Harry's fingers and the sweet taste of raspberries and cream.

Harry's eyes flicked down to her feet. 'That looks like you'd prefer to be fed.' He plucked one of the raspberries off the top and dipped it into the cream.

Fleur parted her lips and raised her head.

'Nuh uh.' He dangled it just out of reach. 'You've got to *ask*.'

A faint pout crept onto her lips. 'You are far too fond of making me ask.' She caught the flash of desire beneath the playful

glint in his eyes and smiled. 'But since you're so *keen,* I will ask. Feed

me, monCœur. *S'il. Te. Plaît*.'

Harry slipped the raspberry between her lips. His thumb traced the curve of her pout as the sweet taste of sugar melted on Fleur's tongue. A little heat pooled between her thighs and she sat up and swung herself into Harry's lap.

'I've changed my mind.' She caught his fingers and drew them down the buttons of her blouse one at a time, then slipped them beneath her dress and trapped his palm against the heat between her legs. 'I *do* want you to distract me.'

'Sex-craving bird-witch,' Harry whispered in her ear. 'But what choice does a wizard have but to try and sate the passion of a veela before she leaves him.'

Fleur squeezed his hand and rested her forehead against

his. 'Try harder,' she breathed.

His fingers curled, slipping into her so slowly she moaned. His thumb drew gentle circles through her wetness as Harry's fingers curled and uncurled inside her; waves of pleasure washed through Fleur and a tight coil twisted tighter and tighter in her abdomen.

*C'est bon.* She bit her lip to stifle the gasps each shiver of pleasure coaxed from her. *C'esttrés bon.*

He tugged the buttons of her blouse open with his free hand and pushed her bra up. Cold air rushed over her breasts and a little moan escaped her throat. 'Don't hold back,' he murmured, sliding his hand up the curve of her neck from her nipple to cup her cheek. 'Just let go.'

'I'm not holding back,' she gasped.

His thumb traced her lower lip and the motion of his fingers sped up inside her. Fleur's breath hitched and the coil of heat between her hips twisted so tight it took all she had not to try and force his fingers further into her. She took his thumb into her mouth and sucked, closing her eyes as Harry's thumb slowed its circling over the burning heat between her thighs.

'You're perfect,' Harry whispered, pressing his thumb down a fraction on her tongue and curving his fingers a little deeper inside her.

A soft moan escaped her and Fleur sucked harder; the coil inside her came undone, ecstasy exploded through her, so bright and hot, little white sparks burst before her eyes.

'Parfait,' she murmured as his fingers slipped out of her.

Harry's eyes burnt with desire as his gaze ran over her. 'You have no idea.'

Fleur slipped out of his lap and down onto her knees. 'My turn, monCœur.' She ran her fingers along his thigh to his straining trousers. 'I've had something sweet; it's time for something else.'

A dull thud echoed through the house. Harry tensed.

Fleur huffed. \'That is the sound of someone failing to apparate past the wards.\'

\'Sirius or Gabby.' Harry sighed. 'What awful timing.'

Fleur gave him a light squeeze, then slipped her bra back on and rebuttoned her blouse. 'I'll make it up to you later, monCœur. *I promise.*'

Harry hauled himself to his feet and rearranged his clothes.

'I'll hold you to that promise,' he teased. 'Is it Gabby?'

'Gabby can't apparate alone and she won't have told anyone the secret, especially without telling us she has.' Fleur rose to her feet, pulled out her wand, and let Sirius in through the wards. 'So it must be your godfather. He's probably feeling a little bruised, bouncing off anti-apparition wards can hurt.\'

Harry grinned. \'I know.\'

A sharp knock echoed from the door.

Harry waved his wand at the door and it creaked open to reveal Sirius. A bright red smear marked his upper lip and chin, glistening beneath his bent, broken nose.

'Hi Sirius.'

\'Decided to put up some wards did we?\' \'Just now, actually,\' Harry replied. \'Episkey.\'

Sirius winced as his nose straightened with a soft crunch,

and blinked hard. \'Thank you.'

\'We can\'t leave you with a crooked nose.' Harry chuckled and waved him onto the sofa. \'Think of the outcry when the world hears Sirius Black\'s face has been marred.\'

\'Witches everywhere will be devastated.'

\'The wanted posters will not be half so attractive,\' Fleur added, settling back into the sofa on the other side of Harry.

\'Don\'t joke, Fleur.\' Harry smirked. \'I\'ve had to use magic to stop hundreds of attempts to kiss Sirius.\'

\'Really?\' Fleur ran her eyes over Sirius's pale face.

\'Oh, yes.\' Harry's smile dripped innocence. \'Dementors can

be such persistent creatures.\'

\'No witches?\' Fleur matched Harry\'s expression.

\'Not even one.\' Sirius sighed. \'I should consider myself fortunate really, my mother is lining up candidate after candidate to continue the most pure bloodline of the Blacks.\'

\'Your mother's still alive?\' Fleur asked.

\'No. She\'s a maddeningly annoying life-size portrait.\'

\'So she can\'t actually arrange you a marriage then,\' Fleur murmured.

\'Not for lack of trying, I'd imagine,' Harry quipped.

Sirius snorted. \'You laugh at my misfortune now, Harry, but you\'re the only other possible heir to the family my dear mother will consider.\'

\'So?\'

\'Her attempts to direct the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black might soon be your problem rather than mine.\'

Fleur sniffed. *I pity anyone foolish enough to try and steal Harry's perfect wish from him. He'd burn this whole country to ashes before losing it.*

\'Speaking of your mother\'s painting and its picturesque placing, how has everyone been?\' Harry\'s question carried the faintest touch of malice.

\'You caused panic.\' Sirius laughed. \'Your disappearing act was a good prank.\'

\'Panic?\' Fleur retrieved the plate of cake and helped herself

to another raspberry. 'Vraiment?'

\'Oh yes. You instigated the largest meeting of the Order of the Phoenix since Voldemort returned. Snape promised us that Voldemort knows nothing about this.\'

\'What did Dumbledore say?\' Harry murmured.

\'He sent a letter to the meeting that expressed grave disappointment in you,\' Sirius said.

\'Only a letter?\' Fleur asked.

'Dumbledore's disappeared off somewhere on his own. He

only told us that it was very important.\'

*Off hunting horcruxes.* Fleur smothered the heat welling up in her bones and finished the cake off, one cream-crowned bite at a time. *And hoping to hurl Harry to his death the moment he finds them.*

\'Mad-Eye Moody wanted to drag you back to headquarters and imprison you until the summer ended,\' Sirius said. \'Dumbledore assured us that you'd have to be returned to your relatives.\'

\'There\'s a small snag with that,\' Harry quipped.

\'Your memory charm. Dumbledore mentioned it in his letter.

It will be left as you made it until you\'re found, then he intends to undo it and return you to your relatives under stricter rules.\'

\'Rules,\' Fleur hissed. \'Albus Dumbledore has *no* authority

over Harry.'

\'Try telling him that,\' Harry muttered. \'What did the rest of the Order think?\'

\'The Weasleys were angry.\' Sirius sighed. \'I know that you and Ron have drifted apart, but they took your disappearance as irresponsible and were furious. Molly fears your actions will cause more members of the Order to be put in danger.\'

\'They volunteered to be put in danger when they joined. The Weasleys are angry because of Arthur\'s death, they can blame Dumbledore or me, and their choice is obvious.\'

*Petty.* Fleur swiped the last cream off the plate and licked it off her finger. *Harry's not to blame.*

\'Insensitive,\' Sirius chided. \'Even if it's true.\'

\'The Weasleys are not the only members, despite their number,\' Harry said.

'Dumbledore *suggested* they look for you whenever and wherever they can.\'

\'Even Snape?\' Ice crept into Harry's tone.

Fleur put a hand on his arm.

\'No. Not Snape. He actually seemed...\' Sirius struggled with himself for a moment. \'Impressed. Snivellus is a sneaky sort. He probably admires your ability to disappear as much as he envies it.\'

\'Envy?\' Fleur arched an eyebrow. 'Why?'

\'If Snivelly could disappear and escape both his masters, he probably would,\' Sirius said.

A flicker of disagreement crossed Harry\'s face. Fleur made a careful note of it.

\'So Dumbledore is off secretly doing something important and the Order searches for me fruitlessly instead of actually fighting.\' Harry rolled his eyes. 'Fantastic.'

\'Be careful if you leave the Meadow,\' Sirius said. \'My cousin, Nym, is adept at tracking down fugitives and is capable of altering her appearance. She was Andi's and Ted's little girl, and she'snot even stopped working to sleep recently...\'

\'I\'ll be careful,\' Harry said.

Fleur hid a smile. *Only Dumbledore and Voldemort are a threat to us.*

\'I need to return,\' Sirius said. \'The Order's at Headquarters

more frequently now. Someone will notice if I\'m away for long.\'

\'Bye, Sirius.\' Harry wrapped the arm Fleur wasn\'t holding around his godfather in a brief but strong hug.

\'I\'ll let you know as things change.' Sirius jumped to his feet. 'But for now the Order is simply trying to combat the rising wave of attacks however we can.\' He leant forward, then smiled and straightened up. \'I\'m going to have to walk past the wards, won't I?\'

\'Yes,\' Fleur said. \' Walk to the road, that\'s far enough to be beyond them.\'

\'If I break my face again you\'ll be hated by hundreds of witches,\' Sirius joked.

Harry grinned. \'I\'m sure.\' The humour faded from his face.

\'Take care, Sirius.'

\'You know me.\' Sirius stepped out into the hall. \'I never do anything rash.\'

The door creaked open and shut, then Sirius's footsteps

faded away down the path.

\'You have things you wish to share?\' Fleur asked. \'You did not agree with him about Snape.\'

\'With you?\' Harry wrapped an arm 'round her shoulders and pulled her close. \'Always.\' His expression grew dark and his eyes turned to chips of ice. \'Snape was the one who passed the prophecy to Voldemort and condemned my parents. He was *fond* of my mother and I have little doubt his true loyalty is to his quest for vengeance.\'

Fleur studied the gleam in Harry's eyes. \'He\'s not the only

one who wants vengeance for what happened, is he?'

\'If he'd not done what he did, I would've never been at Privet Drive.' Harry's eyes turned distant. 'And the reason he did it...\'

*He will kill him.* Fleur recognised the cold gleam in his eyes.

*And rightly so. The damage those muggles did...*

'I have a confession, monCœur.' Fleur wriggled into his side. 'There's a small part of me that's a little glad you endured everything you had to endure.'

Harry squeezed her close. 'There's a small part of me that's glad, too,' he murmured. 'I can't even imagine what things would be like if I'd not found you.'

Fleur pressed her lips to his jaw. 'Don't get caught up in hating all these other people. We just need to be free, that's all. Leave them behind, kill them if that's what it takes, but don't waste our time together on chasing people who aren't worth caring about.

There are always more shallow, little people to try and drag you

down to their level.'

\'I'm going to leave Hogwarts as soon as possible,\' Harry said. \'I\'ll study to take my NEWTs early, this winter, hopefully, and then do whatever research of my own I can manage. Anything I can do to make myself stronger before facing Voldemort, I must do.\'

Fleur huffed. \'There were a lot of pronouns in that sentence that should have been *we*.' She drew his lips down to hers. 'And speaking of *we*, which room do you want to cross off our little list first?'

'Once wasn't enough for you?' Desire gleamed in Harry's eyes and his lips curved into a smirk. 'And you did make me a promise...'

'I alwayskeep my promises,' Fleur murmured, toying with the top button of her blouse until his eyes dipped to her breasts. '*Always*.'

# Brief Tomfoolery

Water gurgled through the pipes and Fleur's soft singing echoed from beyond the steamed window of their bathroom. Harry wriggled out from under the covers and Fleur's silver blanket, dragging on some clothes and clawing his hair down.

\'Up already?\' Fleur stepped from the bathroom in just a towel. Damp, silver locks hung over her bare shoulders, leaving gleaming wet streaks along the delicate line of her collarbone. 'Usually you don't stir until I'm gone.'

Harry kissed her on the nose. 'I always notice you leaving.

I'm no longer lying next to a feathery furnace.'

A hint of a pout crept onto Fleur's lips. 'I am not *feathery*.' 'Liar.' Harry shot her a grin. 'I've seen all those cute little

white tufts you get.'

'When I'm *angry*.' She breezed past him and tossed her towel over his head. 'Which is usually *your* fault. I will admit that I am quite hot, though.'

'*Very* hot.' Harry tugged the warm damp towel off his face and admired Fleur's legs as she bent to retrieve underwear from the drawers.

'I know you're watching me.' 'You *did* say I could.'

Fleur laughed and slipped her feet through something lacy

and blue, pulling on a matching bra. 'I did. And I meant it.' She

swivelled about and offered him a coy smile. 'Am I not the prettiest of them all, monCœur?'

Harry chuckled and stepped forward to pull her into his

arms. 'The prettiest bird-girl I've ever seen,' he murmured.

'I'm the *only* bird-girl you've ever seen.' Fleur turned her nose up at his kiss. 'You will have to do better than that to steal kisses, Harry.'

He smiled down at her. 'I've seen Gabby, she's a bird-girl

too.'

'Not in just her underwear, you haven't.' She slid her fingers

into his hair and gave it a light tug. 'Or you *better* not have.'

'Well, you're the only girl I've seen in just her underwear, feathery or otherwise.' Harry slid a finger under the front-facing clasp of Fleur's bra and teased it up and down. 'Although I can't decide if I like you more with or without it.'

'Stop that,' Fleur murmured, batting his hand away. 'I do not have time before I must be at work.' She kissed him and wrinkled her nose. 'Brush your teeth. And look at the list I left you.'

'What're you doing at work?' He stepped back to let her dress. 'Anything exciting?'

She folded her arms across her chest. 'I waste my time taking apart trinkets and ignoring crass English curse-breakers. Occasionally, I get something that's an interesting challenge, but mostly it's just clock watching and avoiding annoying, tasteless English boys.'

'Have fun, then.'

'Au revoir.' She tucked her wand through the girdle of her

dress, then vanished.

Silence settled over the house.

*It's not so long until she comes back.* Harry made his way into their small, tiled bathroom, divested himself of his clothes and wand, and tapped the large, bronze shower tap. *And it's time to face this highly suspect piece of enchanting.*

The pipes hummed and Harry jumped back against the wall, grimacing as ice-cold water splashed his legs. A faint groan echoed through the house and the water began to warm. Harry stuck his head under the water and let the water stream out of his hair. Steam clouded the windows, the pipes gurgled, and the stream of water stuttered.

*Oh no you don't.* Harry eyed the bronze dial and jumped out as the water turned scalding. *Fleur really needs to fix that.* He grabbed his wand, dispelling the steam and drying himself off.

The hum of the water pipes faded into silence.

Harry spun his wand 'round on his palm. 'Let's go do something.' He slipped his wand back into his sleeve and smothered a soft, rising swell of melancholy. 'Let's go back.'

*I've got to go back at some point.* He stepped forward,

whirling the world back past him, and into Salazar's study.

'I'm...' The words died on his lips. 'I'm back,' he whispered.

Harry ran a finger along the spines of the books stacked upon the desk. *NEWT stuff.* He set aside the books on Dementors and non-verbal spells and skimmed through the pile. *untransfiguration, which I know a tiny bit about, human*

*transfiguration and substance-altering charms.* He ground to a halt before the Potions stack. *We'll worry about that later and I\'ll need Fleur\'s help for Arithmancy, if she's got time.* He stacked the books back up and shrunk them.

A glimmer of gold caught his eye.

He plucked the time-turner off its hook and held it up. Faint light suffused the sand, flickering like a dying bulb.

*It was bound to the wards of the Chamber.* Harry slid his wand from his sleeve and touched its tip to the small hourglass. A strange twist writhed inside the glass, the world bent around it, folding into it over and over until he lost count of the layers; yet the magic around the twist unravelled like a loose thread from a wool jumper.

He spun it once, blurring back fifteen minutes and disillusioning himself to avoid a complicated conversation.

Almost a quarter of the magic bled from the time-turner.

*I\'ll have to save it*. *It\'s no longer restricted to the Chamber of Secrets, but there\'s not much left.* Harry glanced up at the faint outline above the door and the silence closed around him, hollow, cold teeth gnawing at his heart. *I\'ll find a way*. *I\'ll find a way or I\'ll make one.*

He swept Salazar's books on heraldry off the shelf and raided the remnants of his tournament winnings for a few galleons. His invisibility cloak pooled over the chair, the Peverells' symbol gleaming in the faint light.

*The last enemy.* Harry spared the symbol a long look and apparated back to the Meadow. He concealed the books on the

Peverell family beneath the sofa, casting a quick tempus. *What to do for a few minutes?*

He spread the remaining books across the kitchen table and opened the book on inferi. *The Inferius is a re-animated corpse bound to the will of its creator. A macabre puppet of flesh, whose greatest advantages lie in the horror and fear it inspires, the inferius can be a potent tool in the arsenal of any wizard or witch. They are best employed in ambushes or in great numbers to compensate for their lack of magic, but make for devastating weapons against the non- magical. A well cast animation may produce puppets with not only increased speed and strength, but also imbue them with the ability to weather grievous damage.* Harry skimmed through a few pages of graphic images. *The inferius\'s greatest weakness is fire, but severe physical damage will also destroy them. Fiendfyre, then.*

Harry set the book aside, tugging a scrap of parchment covered in Fleur's elegant, flowing script across from beneath a small glass orb in which bubbles of water swirled. *Fleur's list of Voldemort's inner circle.* He ran his eyes over the names. *Malfoy.*

*Crabbe. Goyle. Nott. Avery. The Lestranges. The Carrows. Dolohov. Macnair. Yaxley. Travers.* A thin line ran through Malfoy's name and the last four. Harry pulled out his wand and crossed out Crabbe and Goyle. *Nobody in their right mind would give a horcrux to a Crabbe or a Goyle, they'd probably try and eat it.*

He stood up and stared into the window, tweaking the bone structure of his face, altering the tone of his skin, charming his hair blond, concealing the fading scar on his forehead and changing the shape of his nose a fraction. Tom Riddle stared back at him from the window with green eyes and blond hair.

*That'll do.* Harry chuckled under his breath, straightening his collar and sweeping his fringe to one side. *Voldemort would be furious.* He paused. *Or amused, I suppose.*

Bright sunlight stabbed at Harry's eyes as the kitchen swirled back into Diagon Alley. He blinked once or twice and glanced about. Fleur sat in the corner beneath blue umbrellas, a slice of cake in front of her and a small warm smile on her lips.

He took a step toward her. *I can't... or they'll go after her.*

A tall man's shadow loomed over Fleur, flopping into a seat opposite her and leaning back with the hint of a broad grin. Harry's heart seized and his breath caught in his throat. The dark fingers from his dreams traced Fleur\'s bare skin in the back of his mind.

*She wouldn't. She promised.* He crushed the thoughts down, but doubt bubbled up like thick, hot tar, roiling in his gut.

Harry watched the two of them chat beneath the blue umbrella and forced down a bitter lump.

*He's probably just one of the curse-breakers she was complaining about.*

He tore his eyes away and headed toward the red umbrellas on the far side of the side-alley, pinning his gaze on the top of the centre umbrella as the faint sound of Fleur's laughter drifted over the hedge.

Harry spotted Katie and Nev in the corner at one of the old wooden tables, and pulled a third chair up to the table. \'You\'re starting to sunburn, Nev.'

Nev started, squinting at him. 'Oh, Harry. I\'ve been outside shopping with Gran all morning before her Wizengamot meeting about awarding Amelia Bones emergency powers.\' Nev groaned and scrunched his pink face into a grimace. 'I'm here pretty much everyday at the moment. The Wizengamot are busy.'

'They do have things to do at the moment.' Harry's eyes slid past Nev's shoulder to Fleur's table. She sat alone, a small warm smile on her face, twirling her cake fork in her fingers.

*My smile. For whoever that was.* The breath fled his lungs like he'd been punched in the gut and his heart began to pound. He shoved his anxiety down, wiping the sweat off his palms and taking short, shallow breaths until everything steadied. *Of course she's got other friends. I've got other friends. It doesn't matter she didn't mention him. Remember what Gabby said. You have to trust her.*

Katie shielded her eyes and prodded him in the shoulder. \'Why are you in disguise?\'

He plastered a bright smile onto his face. \'Because I don\'t want to be recognised, of course. Why else would anyone be in disguise?\'

\'Nice glamours.\' Nev grinned. \'You make a good blond.

Malfoy ought to be jealous.\'

\'They\'re not glamours.' Katie poked him in the face and tugged at his hair. \'Too detailed. The hair's charmed, but the rest is transfiguration.\'

Harry removed her hand from his cheek and tracked Fleur as she left the café and drifted back toward Gringotts. 'I don\'t know enough about eyes to alter them, though, so they had to stay the same.\'

\'You have quite distinctive eyes.\' Katie fiddled with the white-hemmed collar of her robes. \'They\'re a very nice shade of green and they do the same thing Dumbledore\'s do.\'

\'My eyes do *not* twinkle.'

Nev snorted. 'No, but they do have a bit of an aura. They\'re a bit more vivid and bright than anyone\'s eyes should naturally be.'

\'It started when you began wearing those lenses Hermione told us about. Did you get magical ones or enchant them somehow?' A wicked grin crossed Katie's face. 'Do they let you see through girls' clothes?' She batted her eyelashes. 'You *know* you only needed to ask, Harry.'

'I'm still here, thank you, you two.' Nev waved a hand between them. 'And I very much *don't* want to see Harry with no clothes.'

Neville.'

'But you'd be happy if it was Katie?' Harry quipped. Nev squeaked. 'What? No!'

Katie laughed. 'I wasn't offering to show anything to

Harry shrugged. 'He prefers cacti and weird tentacle vine

plants, anyway.'

She waved a finger at Harry's eyes. 'What about these lenses, then? Hermione told everyone you must've switched from glasses to muggle contact lenses.'

'Hermione's usually right.'

A group of wizards wandered past their table, cutting out the sun; Katie levelled them with a glare and turned her glower on Harry. 'But not this time.'

A faint warmth trickled through him and the ice faded from

his chest. \'No.' He smiled. 'Not this time. I fixed my eyesight

magically, but it had a few side-effects. I prefer the lenses explanation to having to tell everyone about *my* solution.\'

\'Well, whatever you did was a good idea,\' Katie said. \'Those glasses *really* didn\'t suit you.\'

'I don't miss them.'

Nev's eyes tracked movement over Katie's head.

Harry followed his gaze to a pair of blonde pigtails. 'See something you like, Nev?'

Nev turned bright red. 'Nope.'

'I'll only make snide comments until you tell me.' Katie nodded. 'And I'll make lewd ones.'

'Fine.' Nev squirmed. 'I bumped into her earlier and we said we'd meet up and get lunch.'

Harry grinned and gave him a thumbs up. 'Well done, Nev.

Good for you.'

Nev squinted at him. 'You're not going to say something

mean?'

He shrugged. 'I mean, I can if you want?'

Katie laughed. 'Go get your girl, Neville. I'll see you next

time you drop by.'

Nev dragged himself out of his chair and touched the back of his hand to his sunburn. 'Have you shown Harry your work robes, Katie?' He stumbled away through the tables, blundering through the chairs.

Harry studied Katie's robes. 'They are a bit French maid...'

'Well, if Frenchie would like some, they're not expensive.' Katie rolled her eyes, glanced about and hopped up, displaying a large, white blotch covering her side from stomach to mid-thigh. 'Nev meant this; it's magic resistant, too. Some old wizard's potion.'

He chuckled. 'You took out another goblet, didn't you?' 'Technically, it was a glass.'

'Have you tried transfiguring it?'

Katie glanced about again, then pulled her wand out. 'This happens.' She gave her wand a wave.

The white patch turned transparent, giving Harry a glimpse of dark lace and pale skin, then returned to normal. Heat crept onto his face.

that.'

Katie giggled. 'You *did* ask.'

Harry fought down his blush. 'I wasn't expecting you to do

*Fleur wouldn't be happy.* The shadow of her companion

flitted through his thoughts and his heart flinched. *Probably. Hopefully.*

He buried those thoughts, but the tight knot in his stomach refused to untwist. 'Do you think Hannah will say yes?\'

Katie nodded. \'Everyone knows that Hannah Abbott has the hots for Neville.\'

\'I didn\'t.'

\'All the girls do.\' Katie beamed. \'That\'s why it\'s so funny. He likes her and she likes him, but they've been dancing around each other nervously for a whole year instead of just getting together.\'

\'They weren\'t *that* bad,\' Harry said. \'None of the guys in Gryffindor knew anything about Hannah liking Nev.\'

\'Well, Neville could've been worse, he could have gone to a ball with her, disappeared for the evening, pretended to hate her while moping, then tried to keep his relationship a secret while hiding the bruises on his neck.\'

\'I never pretended to hate Fleur. I didn\'t *mope*, either.\' \'That\'s not what Neville said. He mentioned something

about the Room of Requirement...'

\'Well you shouldn\'t listen to him,\' Harry replied. \'He\'s a malicious liar.\'

\'He\'s the soul of gentility and truth,\' Katie retorted. \'I danced with him at the Ball just after you left with Frenchie actually.\'

Harry sighed. \'I sometimes wonder what would have

happened if I\'d stayed.'

*Would Katie have promised like Fleur?* He wrestled with the sharp, cold claws in his belly. *Would I have found her here with another guy, too?*

\'So do I,\' Katie murmured.

*There's no point wondering.* Harry took a deep breath and let the emptiness rise; it swallowed everything like cold, dark water. *And there's no point wishing. In the end, we'll find out if it's nothing or not.*

\'I\'m sure I would have had one wonderful dance,\' he said. \'Then Fleur would've probably immolated me for abandoning her.\'

Katie giggled, then the humour faded from her face. 'You're not laughing.'

'It wasn't that funny.' He offered her half a smile. 'And besides, you're not meant to laugh at your own jokes.'

She studied him with a soft gleam in her eye. 'You usually laugh. Are you okay?'

*Should I tell her?* He wrestled with the barbed tangle of emotion as it rose back up in his gut; flashes of Fleur's companion and her small, warm smile snarled the thorned coil of feeling. *What would Katie even say? Tell me not to worry? Warn me like Gabby did? She knows even less about what Fleur's doing than I do.*

\'Is there any food?\' Harry asked.

Katie held his gaze for a moment. \'It\'s a café, Harry. We have food. Mainly sandwiches and cake, but the cake *is* good.\'

He shook his head. 'Not cake.'

\'Mum!' Katie waved at the short, brunette witch by the counter. 'Oi!'

\'Aren\'t you meant to be working?\'

\'I\'m on my lunch break, so that means mum has to get my sandwich instead.\'

\'You\'re a terrible employee,\' Harry said.

\'Yes, she is.\' Katie\'s mum bounced across, a note-pad and a

red quill reminiscent of Rita Skeeter's hovering over her shoulder.

Long mahogany bangs fell either side of brown eyes and a few, faint freckles.

who?'

*She looks a lot like Katie, just a little older.*

\'This is Harry,\' Katie said.

\'Harry?\' Katie's mother's eyes drifted over his face. 'Harry

\'I\'m in disguise.' He traced a zig-zag on his forehead with his

finger. 'Katie has forgotten.\'

\'It\'s nice to finally meet you.\' Katie\'s mother smiled. \'I\'ve heard so much about you.' She flapped a hand. \'From Katie, that is, not the rubbish in the Daily Prophet.\'

\'Thank you.'

\'What would you like, Katie?\' Katie's mother waved her

hand toward the counter.

The quill perked up; the feather snapped straight and the nib dipped towards the page.

\'We\'ll just have two chicken and bacon sandwiches,\' Katie

said. 'But without the tomato for me please.\'

\'Worried you\'ll make a mess of yourself again?' Katie's mother patted a fuming Katie on the cheek. \'Harry? My daughter often forgets that her friends like to choose their own food.\'

\'I don\'t mind,' he said, smiling. 'I\'ll go with it.'

\'Any drinks?\' The quill bobbed. Katie shook her head.

Harry shook his. 'No thanks.'

\'I\'ll bring them over in a minute, Katie. You can have a bit of a longer break today than usual, too.\' Katie\'s mother threw a smile at Harry, then bounced off to the next table.

Harry grinned. \'She\'s *so* like you.'

Katie grimaced. \'So everyone always tells me. I took an ageing potion once when I was a kid and Dad almost mistook me for her.\'

\'Awkward\...'

\'He realised as soon as he saw what I was wearing.\' Katie shrugged. \'Mum\'s more concerned about her appearance than me. I don\'t really bother with pretty clothes or make-up.\'

\'It gets in the way of quidditch and it makes it harder to

scare firsties.'

She nodded. \'No smart Dark Mistress wears pretty dresses and make-up. They\'d get ruined by all the blood or torn during some nefarious deed.\'

Katie\'s mother gave her daughter an odd look and slid their sandwiches onto the table. \'Here you are. I took the tomato out for you, Katie, so this time you won\'t spill it all over your lap like a baby.\'

Katie growled. \'Thanks, mum.'

Her mother smiled, then her eyes flicked past them into the street and her expression darkened. A pair of Hit Wizards drifted past the table.

\'What was that about?\' Harry asked as Katie's mother

wandered away.

\'Dad used to be a Hit Wizard for the Department of Law Enforcement,\' Katie said. \'He fought in the war against --- against Voldemort, and he was fairly accomplished. Amelia Bones has been trying to get every trained wizard or witch back into uniform now things are escalating, but mum doesn\'t want him out fighting where he might get hurt.\'

\'He might not have a choice about fighting,\' Harry murmured. \'Even if he doesn\'t go back to law enforcement, the war might come to him. Diagon Alley's a big target.\'

\'I know.\' Katie took a small bite of her sandwich. \'I\'d still rather he was at home and a bit safer, even if it\'s selfish.\'

He nodded. 'I can understand that. I'd prefer it if you were

safe.'

\'It\'s going to be bad, isn\'t it?\' Katie whispered. \'I\'ve never

seen Diagon Alley so busy, everyone\'s trying to get things done before the chaos begins, all the shops are packed.\'

\'It\'s going to be bad, but you\'ll be fine. I promise.\'

\'And you. You\'ll be right in the middle of it. He\'ll be going after you *himself*.\'

'I'll be safe.'

\'You better be,\' Katie muttered. \'If you get yourself hurt, Frenchie won\'t get the chance to set you alight, I\'ll get you first.\'

\'I think Fleur will probably resent you stepping in line ahead of her.\' Harry tried to grin, but the blue umbrellas over Katie's head sapped the cheer from him. \'She\'ll set you alight too.\'

'Okay.' Katie dropped her sandwich. 'What's wrong with you and her?'

Harry raised an eyebrow. 'What?'

'The moment I mentioned her, you went all miserable.' She brushed crumbs off her hands. 'So what's wrong? I'm your best friend, Harry, you can talk about it with me. You can't just deal with it all by yourself. That's not going to work.'

He sighed. 'I suppose.'

Katie slid her hand across the table and gave his fingers a

squeeze. 'And?'

'I saw her with another guy---'

'She *what!?*' Katie clapped her hands over her mouth. 'Sorry.

I was just surprised. You two seemed happy.'

Harry shrugged. 'They were just talking and smiling, nothing

bad.'

She chewed her lip and picked at the crust of her sandwich.

'Well, don't go and start a fight over it, and don't do anything stupid. Because if it's really nothing, then you'll only *create* a problem.' Katie's lip trembled as she smiled. 'And, most importantly, if Roger Davies asks you to the Yule Ball before you've had a chance to talk things out with Frenchie, don't say yes.'

Harry snorted and rolled his eyes. 'Roger Davies isn't my

type.'

Hedwig fluttered down between their plates, stealing the

remaining part of Harry\'s sandwich.

\'Hey!\' He reached out to retrieve his meal.

Hedwig hissed and started pulling it apart with her beak. \'She\'s mad at you,\' Katie said.

\'I left her in the Owlery because she can\'t find where I\'m currently living,\' he said. \'She appears to have taken it on herself to find me.\'

\'And your sandwich.\'

\'And my sandwich.'

Hedwig finished Harry\'s sandwich in a few, swift beakfuls and hopped toward Katie's. She stuffed hers into her mouth with a triumphant, if muffled, cry. Hedwig hooted, hopping back across to peck at Harry's fingers.

\'I shall have to take her back with me,\' he said, wincing as

Hedwig's beak took a piece out of his knuckle.

Katie laughed and eyed his ravaged hands. \'She might take a whole finger next time if you don\'t.'

\'Sorry, Katie.\' Her mum squeezed between two tables to take their plates. \'It\'s becoming really busy and I need your help.\'

\'I guess I\'d better get back out there, then.\' Katie sighed and stood up. \'Sorry, Harry.\'

\'Don\'t worry.' He slid out of his chair. \'I\'ve got a few books about family history to find.\'

Katie\'s mother turned away, twisting between chairs and tables, followed by her floating pad and quill.

\'Until next time---'

Katie threw her arms 'round him and pulled him into a tight, warm hug. A pleasant scent of broom polish and coffee reached Harry's nose.

\'You're a lot shorter than me now.' He patted the top of her

head where it tucked under his chin.

\'Hush,\' Katie murmured. \'I still remember when you were a midget back in first year, all skinny and tiny.\' She tightened her grip on him. 'Don't mess things up with Frenchie over nothing, Harry, but if she's too stupid to realise how great you are and is sneaking about behind your back with some other guy, then ditch her and find yourself someone better.'

*There's nobody else.* A parade of girls flooded past the eye of Harry's mind; they faded away from Fleur's small, warm smile and her bright blue eyes like shadows before the sun. *She's my only perfect wish.*

'I won't lose her.' Harry eased himself out of Katie's hug.

*I mustn't.* A cage of thorns clamped around his heart. *I can't.*

Katie\'s mother watched them with soft eyes from across the café and Katie flushed when she followed his gaze across.

\'I\'m sorry if she gets the wrong idea,\' Katie whispered. \'Don\'t be. Can\'t be any worse than the Daily Prophet.\'

She laughed. \'You don\'t know my mum very well.' Her face fell. 'Stay safe, Harry. Please.'

'I'll try.'

Hedwig fluttered to Harry's shoulder and nibbled at his ear.

He took a deep breath, glanced across at the blue umbrellas, then apparated back to the Meadow with a soft snap.

# Sense and Sensibility

Towering stacks of paper and crates loomed over Fleur's desk like the twinned mountains over Beauxbatons's turrets. Her enchanted quill scratched away beside her and the stack of forms dwindled beneath its determined progress.

*Still half an hour before I can leave...*

She levitated a wooden torc with bronze studs out of her crate and closed her eyes. A faint warmth lingered in the metal points, the comfort of a blanket trapped behind a bubble of magic. Fleur tossed it back into the crate and left her quill to run through the forms, tugging her list out from beneath the strap of her bra.

*Nott. Avery. The Lestranges. The Carrows.*

She pulled the notebook out of her desk drawer and drew an *H* on the front cover with the tip of her wand, it shivered, the ribbon shrank away and it flopped open.

*Nott's the loner. Don't know much about Avery. The Carrows are a violent pair of siblings with an unconventional relationship. The Lestranges are the Carrows, but brothers, and more dangerous.*

'Fleur!' Bill's voice echoed down the hall.

She snapped the book shut, redrew the pattern and slipped

her list back into her bra. 'Bill.'

He strode over waving a small, dark box. 'I brought you a challenge.' Bill paused and tugged at the dragon fang dangling from his ear. 'I was going to make a joke, but thought better of it. However,

since you've beaten me every time so far, I needed to bring out

something a bit trickier.' He grinned. 'This time, I'll win.'

A faint smirk curved Fleur's lips and she stuck out her hand. 'I will win. As always.'

Bill placed the box on her palm. 'It's inside.'

She pried it open and found a gleaming bronze band upon black velvet. 'A ring?' Fleur narrowed her eyes at him.

*You've been bearable, even enjoyable, company.* A tiny flare of heat rose in her chest. *Don't ruin it now.*

Bill raised his hands. 'Remember, I *didn't* make the joke---' 'Wise of you.'

She closed her eyes and held her wand tip to the ring. Threads of magic writhed in an endless circle within the bronze, slithering 'round like a thousand tiny serpents. Fleur took a deep breath and focused harder. Each thread hummed a little different from the others, together, their buzz rose and fell in a strange, repeating crescendo.

'Intriguing.' Fleur opened her eyes and put the ring down on

her desk.

'Any idea what it does?' Bill edged a little closer.

'Do you?' Fleur fixed a pointed stare at the gap between

them. 'I assume you stopping by means I remain qualified to play

with these little trinkets?'

'Unless you'd rather not be?' Bill frowned. 'Tell the truth, it doesn't make much sense for you to be here. You're *way* too good to

be working here. You could probably have *my* job if it didn't require a few years of experience.'

'My boyfriend.' Fleur tapped the ring with her wand. 'So?' 'Right. Your boyfriend.' Bill's eyes lingered on her for a

moment, then snapped back to the ring. 'Sorry, your magic got me for

a moment there. I can ignore it if I'm not looking at you, but that feels a bit rude, you know.' He swept the box off the desk and stuffed it back into his pocket. 'I've no idea what the ring does, by the way. The magic just goes around and around.'

'It has a song,' Fleur said. 'All the little threads that go round

buzz and together it makes a pattern.'

'Well, that's more than I got.' Bill shrugged and fingered the dragon fang. 'Keep it. See if you can figure out anything more. It's harmless, we got it from an old lady who'd worn it half her life, she even swallowed it as a baby, so it can't cause any harm.'

Fleur weighed the ring on her palm. 'I will solve it.'

'I've full faith in you.' Bill gave her a thumbs up and glanced at the clock. 'And on that note, I've checked up on you, so you might as well head off a few minutes early.' He waved a hand at her quill. 'Something tells me that will keep going even if you're not here.'

Fleur chuckled. 'Of course.' She slipped her notebook back

into the drawer.

Bill strode toward the stairs, then paused. 'Oh. Fleur. Before I forget. There's a "social drinks" thing happening sometime over the next couple of days. Things aren't looking great, so we decided to get together in case it's the last chance. You're more than welcome to come.'

Fleur wrinkled her nose. 'I'll think about it.'

'There'll be drinking.' He flashed her a grin. 'But it's entirely voluntary for the most part and you can always crash at mine or Bronwyn's if it gets too late.'

Fleur pursed her lips. 'I'm sure.'

'Right.' Bill spun on his heel. 'I'm off. Later, Fleur.'

She waited for the sound of his steps to fade, then stuck the bronze ring on her left forefinger, grabbed her wand, and hurried down the stark marble corridor to the apparition point.

*Time for home.*

She pictured the kitchen of the Meadow and willed herself

there.

Harry glanced up from his book on untransfiguration. 'Fleur.' She blinked. 'Not a fun book, monCœur?'

The ghost of a smile crossed his lips. 'Not really, but at least

it's easy.' His gaze drifted down to her hands. 'New jewellery?' 'One of the curse-breakers gave it to me.'

'I thought they were all tasteless English boys?' Harry buried his nose back in his book. 'I hope you checked it for enchantments. Have you tried putting it in the fire and looking for any writing?'

*Merde.* A lance of fear pierced through her. *Of course he reacts like this. Even the faintest hint of doubt and he'll fear I'm just another false hope.*

She pushed his book down with one finger. 'I saw you in

Diagon Alley a couple of days back. With Katie.'

Harry nodded; his smile so bright and false it turned Fleur's stomach. 'I stopped by to talk to her while she was on her lunch break. I saw you, too.'

'And Bill.' She winced at the darkness that flitted through

his eyes, but the smile never faltered. 'He's my supervisor.'

His book rose back up. 'How's the cake in the other café? I didn't get a chance to try the cake at Katie's parents' place.'

'It's not as good as it is in Paris.' Fleur tugged the book out of his hands and set it down on the kitchen table. She placed her hand down beside his. 'I told you not to smile at me like that once; it upsets me.'

The bright cheer slid off his face. 'You've said a lot of things to me.' He leant back in his chair and put his hands in his lap. 'I remember them *all*.'

*My promise.* Her heart sank. *How many wishes were ripped*

*away from you to leave you so brittle, monCœur?*

She sighed and pushed his chair back from the table with her foot, swinging herself into his lap. 'What would you like me to say, Harry? I spoke to him for less than two minutes and you're acting like you caught us in bed together.'

He tensed and leant back from her. 'Will I?'

Heat bubbled up in Fleur's bones, little white feathers bursting through her skin and her face shifting as the liquid warmth shivered through her chin. She took a deep breath and stopped her

change. 'Non. You are being an idiot. And you are lucky that I know

*why* you're being an idiot.'

Harry turned away to stare out over the meadows. 'I can't help it. The moment I saw you... I can't stop thinking about it.'

*And now you're waiting for it, because it's always happened before.* She caught her pitch-black eyes in the glass and sighed. *Time will prove his doubts wrong.*

She slipped the ring off her finger and held it up. 'This --- this is a puzzle, nothing more. He is... well, I don't dislike him, but he's not even a friend.' Fleur forced the heat to fade. 'I love *you*, Harry.'

'For now.' Harry avoided meeting her eyes in the window. 'But you're *you*. One day, someone else will come, and if you wanted them, you'd just have to smile and you could walk away.'

'Walk away with who? Some stupid, shallow boy who looks at me and only wonders what I look like on my back with my legs spread?' Fleur's lip curled and she slipped the ring back onto her finger. 'I'm not stupid, monCœur. I know how devoted you are to reaching our sunset together. I'm not trading that. I'm not trading that for anything.'

The shadow faded from his eyes. 'Sorry.'

'You should be sorry.' She sighed and rested her head on his

chest. 'It's not like you were sitting alone and pining for me, Harry...'

'Katie.' A faint smile quirked his lips. 'Of course.' The dark, desperate gleam flitted through his eyes. 'Would you like me to swear a vow? I will if you want.'

Fleur twitched and slid herself out of his lap. 'I don't want you to swear a vow because you're afraid.' She took a deep breath and held his eyes. 'You will *learn* to trust me.'

'I don't *dis-*trust you---'

'Yes you do.' She stifled the wash of heat through her bones before the feathers could slip from beneath her skin. 'And I *don't* like it. If I didn't understand why you were being like this, I would be far less forgiving, monCœur.'

Panic flashed through his eyes. 'I'm sorry,' he whispered. 'I don't -- I just...'

Fleur's heart twisted. 'Let's not talk about this anymore. I will give the ring back and when we are done with Voldemort, I am leaving Gringotts anyway. You will have all the time you need to realise that no matter what happened to all the other things you wished for, *I* am going nowhere.' She cupped his cheek and let the words spill out. 'Love's not *meant* to be endless bliss; it's meant to hurt. If it didn't hurt to hold onto it, it wouldn't be so satisfying to have.'

*I'll give the ring back when I've figured it out.* She twisted the slim band of bronze around her forefinger while Harry stared at it like it'd caught flame. *It's not like he doesn't spend all his time with a girl he used to date, then laugh when I get jealous.*

'I need to get some more books from the Chamber of Secrets.' Harry pushed himself to his feet. 'I want to try and pin down what happened to the Peverells. I've stolen the spare bedroom for it.'

Fleur cocked her head. 'Show me? Before you go?'

He vanished with a soft snap and the floorboards creaked above her head.

upstairs.

*Not together?* She pursed her lips, apparating herself

A soft purple glow bathed a swirling storm of parchment

covered in Harry's cramped handwriting. Grindelwald's mark burnt upon the ceiling in violet flame, lines of indigo fire spreading from it like the roots of a tree, linking the pages stuck to the walls.

Fleur wrinkled her nose. 'I'm not sure I like your redecorations, monCœur.'

Harry flicked his wand and the whirling pages rustled back into stacks upon the wall and ceiling. 'I've got everything I could ever need about the Peverell family up until about 1300 AD on the ceiling, after that the family kind of breaks up into three parts.' He traced his wand tip down one of the purple lines. 'This is the part of the family that ends up becoming part of the Potter family. My theory is one of the other branches had the stone.'

'It won't be easy to find.' She traced her fingertips along where one purple line split into seven, then came to an abrupt end at a single stack of paper. 'Any one of them could have ended up with it and that's if it even remained with the family. Someone might've stolen it.'

He grimaced. 'The wand was stolen before the split. Godric Gryffindor died trying to retrieve it, according to Salazar. I've no idea where it went or who took it, but I don't care. I'm not after all three, I just want the stone.'

Fleur scanned the pages running along the wall beside the window. 'This is the line that remained Peverell after the three-way split?'

'Two daughters and one son.' Harry nodded and pointed his wand at the far stack of paper. 'And the son's descendants got wiped

out during the Wars of the Roses. They changed sides to play kingmaker with the Earl of Warwick once too often.'

*He isn't going to give up.* She pursed her lips. *He believes the stone exists and until it's proved beyond all doubt that it doesn't, he won't give up. Just like I wouldn't.*

'Would you like me to have a look at the Gringotts records?' Fleur tossed her hair back over her shoulder. 'I have more than enough time to go hunting for what happened to the things owned by various Peverells after they died.'

'You will?' Harry's expression brightened.

'I will.' She raised a finger. 'But only if you can prove we're not just chasing a silly myth. I don't want to waste our time together, monCœur. Just like there's no sense hating all the stupid, shallow people who'll try to drag us down, there's no point obsessing over impossible things.'

'It's real.'

Fleur frowned. 'That's not *proof.*'

Harry's brow creased, and he wavered and reappeared with a soft double-snap. A silver cloak pooled in his hands. 'I thought it was an old family heirloom, and it is, but...' He held it up in the purple light. 'It's also *the* cloak.'

The faded symbol Grindelwald had left across Europe gleamed on the cloak.

Fleur's breath caught and she pulled her wand out. 'May I?' A faint smile passed across his face. 'Don't take it apart.'

'I won't.' She touched the tip of her wand to the cloak and closed her eyes.

An endless void danced at the edge of her senses like the northern lights in the sky. Her magic bled into it and vanished like a candle dropped into a well.

'I can't make any sense of it,' Harry said.

Fleur opened her eyes. 'Me neither.' She tucked her wand away. 'Perhaps we can let Gabby take a look at it?'

Harry froze. 'Yes. I'll take it to her. I think I want to talk to her

anyway.'

'Another private visit to see my little sister, monCœur?' She

arched an eyebrow at him and rested her arms on his shoulders, brushing her nose against his. 'It sounds like it's *me* who ought to be worrying.'

'I'll put this back where it's safe and get my books.' Harry

vanished with a quiet snap.

*No kiss.* A soft little ache twisted between her ribs, a sweet sharpness beneath her skin. *Well, you'll realise soon, and how much it hurts now will just make things taste all the sweeter later.*

# Playmate

A faint square of stone gleamed in the flickering purple flame of Harry's hovering runes. Shadows fluttered along the bookshelves, pooling in the corners of the study.

He watched the symbol of the hallows burn in the air before the empty wall above the door, then swiped his hand through them, scattering purple flame and showering the floor in violet sparks. 'What do I do, Salazar?' His voice shrank to a whisper. 'What if --- what if she changes her mind and leaves? What if it's just me again?'

Silence closed over him like thick, cold fog.

*Gabby.* Harry snatched the cloak off the chair. *Gabby said to come talk to her. She'll know better than anyone if Fleur would change her mind or not. And Fleur said to show her the cloak.*

He pictured the turret-top. *It's too far to apparate. I need*

*Fleur's portkey.*

Harry drummed his fingers on the desk and watched the faint glimmer of the time-turner. 'I'll have to go visit Fleur at work.' His stomach knotted, churned and thrashed, and his heart clamped up in the base of his throat.

*And what will I see this time? An embrace? A kiss?* He wiped his palms dry on his thighs and took a long, deep breath. *Just tell her you're coming and you'll see nothing.* His fingers crept to the acorn dangling on its silver chain and his heart sank. *But I'd want to know sooner. It might hurt less.*

He pictured the red umbrellas and stepped forward past the board toward the scatter of sun-drenched tables. Katie's mother

caught his eye and poked Katie on the shoulder. She spun, her eyes went wide as galleons, and she darted \'round the counter, scattering cutlery over the floor.

A little warmth spread through Harry as she caught him in a tight hug. 'You're probably the worst waitress that has ever waitressed.'

'That's what mum tells me!' Katie beamed. 'Did you come to surprise me?'

His gaze slipped across to the blue umbrellas. 'Not just you.' Her face fell. 'Are you still worried?'

Harry plastered a bright smile on his face. 'I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.'

'Uh huh.' She shoved him down into a seat. 'Frenchie won't be there for another few minutes. She turns up like clockwork.'

'Been watching her?' Harry's heart hovered in his throat. 'What did you see?'

Katie smoothed her top down. 'Well. I mean---'

'Just tell me.' He released a long breath. 'I'd rather just hear it, you know.'

She studied her fingernails. 'She comes for lunch at the same time and she usually just eats cake, which is weird, and I have *no idea* how she keeps looking so good when she eats that much cake, but I can't exactly go ask her---'

'Katie.'

'Right. Sorry.' She glanced up at the blue umbrellas. 'Okay, so, *before* I say anything. I haven't seen a single thing that looks bad, like *nothing*.'

Harry's heart twisted beneath his ribs. 'But you have seen *something.'* His voice trembled. 'You wouldn't be trying so hard to avoid saying anything if you'd not.'

'That cursebreaker is there a *lot*,' Katie blurted. 'But they really do just chat, Harry.'

*But she doesn't chat with other guys.* A flash of the photo of Gabby and Fleur and all the trinkets on her bookshelves flitted through his thoughts and a cold, sick feeling tore through him. *She never has. Except for me.*

Katie's eyes flicked past his shoulder, and she twisted \'round, pointing at the counter. 'Want some food? A drink? On the house, or, well, probably on *me*, because mum doesn't really give discounts. Business isn't great these days.'

Harry caught the little gleam of worry in her eye and glanced back across the street, glimpsing silver hair drifting through the shadows beneath the blue umbrellas.

'Don't do anything stupid, Harry,' Katie whispered. 'You don't want to ruin something good over a misunderstanding.'

'I need to talk to her anyway.' He swung himself out of his seat. 'If I come back in a few minutes in a really bad mood, then I might need a drink. I assume you have a stash of Firewhiskey?'

A faint smile passed across Katie's face. 'Deal. If it all goes wrong, you come back here and I'll find us some Firewhiskey.'

He mussed her hair. 'Sounds good.'

'Oi.' Katie shook her hair out. 'Just because it's not silver and doesn't look like I spent an hour carefully washing and brushing it, doesn't mean you can ruin it.'

Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath. 'Hopefully, I won't see you for a couple of days.'

She stuck her tongue out at him. 'You can come back

afterward, it's not like there's anyone here to wait on.'

'I have to go sort some stuff.' Harry reopened his eyes. 'See you later.'

Katie gave him a small wave, but he felt her eyes on him all the way across to the blue umbrellas.

'Fleur.' He pulled the chair out. 'Slightly different company at lunch to your usual boy, I'm afraid.'

Her eyes darkened to midnight blue. 'How is she?' Harry blinked. 'How is...?'

Fleur pointed one slim finger across at the red umbrellas.

'You know who.'

'Voldemort?' A brief laugh burst through Harry's lips. 'I assume he's scheming some kind of convoluted death trap for me. He usually is.'

Pitch black irises pierced through him. 'Katie. Katie Bell. The cute girl you were with before me. The girl you were chatting to just now. The girl who *I'd have every right to be far more worried about than you have to be about anyone*. Tu as de la chance que je te connais, mon Cœur!' Fleur took a deep breath. 'If I didn't *know* you,

monCœur, I wouldn't waste any time waiting around to watch you

betray me.'

A cold fist clamped around his heart. 'I wouldn't. I would

*never*.'

The dark drained from Fleur's eyes and her expression

softened. 'I know. Because you're different.' She reached out and touched a warm fingertip to his temple. 'Up here.' Her hand slipped into his hair and dragged him forward. 'But that doesn't mean it doesn't *hurt* to see the suspicion in your eyes.' She pulled his lips down to hers and placed a small glass bead on the table. 'Now. Go talk to my little sister.'

'How---'

'Mon Cœur.' She smiled and poked the bead across. 'I know Gabby. And I know you. Go talk to her. I hope it helps.'

The knot in his stomach loosened. 'I'm sorry,' he whispered,

taking the bead.

'I know.' Fleur's lips quirked. 'And you *will* be making it up to me.' She pointed her cake fork at the bead. 'Say hi to Gabby for me\... *Aimée*.'

The world jolted forward and Harry staggered across the turret top to lean on the crenulations and stare out at the mountains.

The door creaked. 'Fleur?' Gabby\'s footsteps paused. 'Harry.' He turned 'round. 'I've come to elope with you.'

Her grey eyes darkened. 'No you haven't. You're here because you've upset my sister and you don't know how to stop doing it.'

Harry winced from the twist of guilt beneath his ribs. 'I also brought you a legendary magical artefact to *listen* to, but yes\...' He sighed. 'I *know* she hasn't done anything. I don't even really think she *would*---'

'But you can't stop thinking about it, can you.' Gabby\'s eyes shifted to storm-grey. 'So you're hoping I'm going to tell you there's nothing to worry about.'

'Yes,' he admitted.

'And when you leave, you'll go right back to worrying.' Gabby stalked across the turret top. 'I am going to tell you a lot of things Fleur made me promise not to, Harry. Some of them I hope you already know. And if that doesn't help, then *nothing* will, and unless *you* change, you'll lose her.'

Harry swallowed hard. 'Okay.'

Gabby stabbed a finger over the wall down at the buildings below. 'Fleur hates this place. *Really* hates it. When I leave, I doubt she'll ever return again. She's got all the best parts of Maman and Papa and never really struggled with anything at all until she began to dream of the sort of perfect romance everyone craves at some point or another. *Maman's*books, the whole L'Amourd\'Aimée series, were bought for Fleur when she was younger, but, well, the perfect romance didn't come easily. People can be shallow, friends and boys alike, and Fleur hates how selfish and fickle they are.'

'She said it isn't *meant* to come easily.'

'Fleur measures the value of things by how much they hurt to have,' Gabby murmured. 'She expects to find things easy, but only really loves the things that aren't. If she wasn't convinced you loved her as completely and utterly as she expects, she\'d never have spoken to you. She *nearly didn't.'*

'During the tournament.'

'Oui.' Gabby glowered at him. 'You misunderstood and lashed out at her. She assumed that meant she wouldn't be able to get what she wanted no matter how much pain she spent to buy it.'

'But she realised.'

Gabby scoffed. 'She realised and refused to do anything. *I*

made her write to you. If I hadn't convinced her it was worth *trying\...'*

'Thank you,' he whispered.

'Well, at least *you* said thank you.' Gabby flicked chips of stone off the edge. 'Fleur knows I know she's grateful, but she's not said it, and she didn't even tell me you'd come to see her and things had worked out.'

'But if she reached out to me.' The words bubbled up from the cold well of fear in Harry\'s breast. 'She could do it again. I know she's been talking to another guy. A lot.'

'Don't be stupid.' Gabby shot him an ink-black glare. 'You are the *only* boy I've ever seen keep her interest for more than a few conversations, let alone six months, and even if she's stumbled across another one that doesn't irritate her, Fleur will *never* trade away her perfect romance.' Gabby\'s eyes softened back to grey and she screwed up her face. 'Everything Fleur finds easy, she doesn't value very highly, simply *because* it's easy. You are the one thing she thought it was impossible for her to have after she craved it. There's no comparison. If you don't ruin things, she will never leave you.'

*And she knows I'd never leave her, she said she understands.* The churning eased in Harry\'s gut, but a fresh knot tightened there. *But if it has to hurt for her value it, will she keep finding guys like this curse-breaker to make sure it does?*

'Thank you,' he muttered.

Gabby hummed. 'I have already scolded Fleur for making me play peacemaker between her and you as *well* as her and our parents. Now I have scolded you, too. That is everyone.'

'Want to have a crack at this?' Harry held the cloak out. '*Just*

listen*.* I wasn't joking when I said it was legendary.'

She gathered the cloak into her arms and closed her eyes. 'It\'s---' a gasp tore from her lips '---*incroyable*\...' She screwed her face up and clutched the cloak to her chest. 'I don't even know how to describe it. It's that niggling fear of eyes in the dark, the unsettling little feel of the creeping count of birthdays, the helplessness of watching the sun set on a perfect day, inevitable, intangible, inescapable, all woven with magic into the threads of this cloak.'

'It's a Deathly Hallow,' Harry murmured. 'I\'m descended from the Peverells. Your Papa can probably tell you all about it.'

'Merde,' Gabby whispered, opening her eyes. 'I don't know *how* they made this, it's not like anything else. There's no *structure\...* It's just feeling and magic, as one, no threads of different enchantments at all.' She passed it back to him. 'I'm not even sure this cloak is enchanted silk, it might just *be* magic.'

'Do you know about the other two Hallows?'

'I do.' She flicked her hair back over her shoulder. 'And if they're anything like this, I can only imagine how potent all of them are together. Are they different facets of death, perhaps, so having all three makes you master of it as a whole?'

'Your guess is going to be better than mine.'

Gabby pointed a finger at the cloak. 'That is *not* an enchanted garment; it's not an object with magic imbued into it at all, it's --- it's like listening to the magic of a person, like when you used legilimency to show me how you felt or when I listened to your wand.' She frowned and poked at the stonework. 'It's almost a manifestation of death, created by all the little feelings we have about the idea of dying, and I can't begin to tell what it really does.'

*Makes sense. Nothing stops death in the end. Not even horcruxes.*

'I'm going to head back,' he murmured. 'Thank you, Gabby.'

A faint smile passed over her lips. 'Be perfect for her Harry. I won't forgive you for being anything less.'

*Neither will I.* He closed his eyes and apparated back into the kitchen, side-stepping Fleur and a chocolate-smeared cake knife.

'Did it help?' She licked chocolate from the gleaming steel with the tip of her tongue. 'How was Gabby?'

Harry let himself feel the fear, the twisting, thrashing coil, then smothered it. 'It helped.' He offered her a faint, wry smile. 'The only boy who's going to ruin this is me.'

Fleur placed the knife on the counter and pressed her lips to his cheek, resting her forehead on his and her arms on his shoulders. The soft wash of her sigh fluttered past his neck. 'I missed this. You kept leaving or finding things to do.'

Guilt clenched its fist about Harry's heart. 'I'm sorry,' he whispered, wrapping his arms 'round Fleur and drawing her tight against him. 'I hope it didn't hurt too much.'

'It hurt.' She leant her head back, her bright blue eyes staring up at him through her dark lashes. 'It hurt just enough to make this moment *perfect*.'

He cradled her warmth against him, breathing in her sweet, sharp scent of burnt holly, marzipan, cherry-perfume and rich, dark chocolate. 'I love you.' Harry tightened his arms around her and swallowed a hot, thick knot of feeling. 'I love you more than anything.'

Fleur's lips brushed his cheek. 'I know, monCœur, I know.' Her fingers curled into his back and slid down to his waist. 'You will make it up to me later, non? Give me *anything* I ask for?'

A little heat trickled south and his breath caught. 'Whatever and wherever you like.'

A soft laugh left her lips and Fleur drew back, picking up two steaming mugs. 'But not until after your godfather has gone. He's just finishing up in the shower, I think he prefers the bathroom here to where he was before.'

Harry glanced at the mugs. Simple tea sat beside cream- topped, sugar-sprinkled hot chocolate. 'Perhaps this would be a good moment to finish the protections for our home.'

\'Something sanguine?\' She lifted her hot chocolate to her lips and took a small sip.

'Yes.' Harry dragged his eyes away from Fleur\'s mouth. \'Will you need some of my blood?\' Fleur asked.

\'Yes,\' Harry admitted. 'I'll need blood from you and Sirius.'

Fleur placed the mugs down on the table and reached for the knife. Holding it with two fingers she dipped her thumb upon the gleaming, silver tip. A bright crimson bubble welled up on its ball.

'Thanks.' Harry flicked his wand out to levitate the drop of blood over the table, his eyes on her thumb. 'Is it okay?'

'It's just a pinprick.' Fleur sucked the red away, grimaced and took a long drink of hot chocolate. Cream clung to her nose as she wiped the knife clean.

\'Do you want me to heal it?\' Harry reached out and swiped the cream from her nose with a finger, licking it off.

Fleur smiled and tossed her hair over her shoulder. \'I am quite good with healing spells, Harry, even if I do not heal like you do.\'

\'Nobody naturally heals like me.\' Harry shrugged. 'That door lock scratched me pretty badly and it healed up after a minute or two.'

\'I am very envious.\' Fleur sighed. 'It looks very useful.'

\'You can wordlessly and wandlessly conjure fire hot enough to melt people,\' Harry said. \'No ritual will gift me that.\'

\'I had a read through that book.\' She pointed in the direction of the tome he'd taken from Salazar\'s library. \'None of the rituals within seem prudent considering my nature.\'

'I'm not sure how your nature would mix with the new imbuements.' A grimace slipped onto Harry's face. 'And you don't need to do them anyway. You're perfect.' He leant across and pressed a soft kiss to her lips. 'As always.'

'Maybe when we have more time we'll be able to create some of our own and I'll find a way to safely replicate that ability of yours for myself.'

\'It\'ll be fun.\' Harry grinned. 'Although we'll have to be careful. Don't want to mess up and lose my bird-girl.'

'You have to be careful, too.' Fleur cocked her head at the sound of thudding upon the stairs. 'I saw your notes in the margins. You designed the next one yourself.'

\'Yes. It'll be okay, though, especially when I have you around

to nurse me back to health.'

*Salazar would be proud*. He crushed the hollow claws before they could sink too deep. *Salazar will be proud. I will see him again.*

\'I won't be gentle on you just because you thought it was a good idea to empty your veins for a fractional advantage over others,\' Fleur jibed.

\'A fractional reduction of my disadvantage you mean,\' Harry murmured. \'Voldemort's likely done every ritual imaginable on himself and even though his old body was destroyed, it\'s likely many are still effective.\'

\'How many more do you intend to do?\' Fleur's blue eyes darkened a few hues. \'I know you enjoy creating them, but they\'re dangerous.\'

\'Only two for now.\' Harry mentally scrapped plans for a third, risky ritual as her eyes shifted toward deep azure. \'One will be to try and even things between Voldemort and myself. As it stands, I can match him for speed and likely for power, but I tire much faster

than he does. This ritual will help me recover quicker and ensure I last a bit longer in a prolonged duel.\'

\'And the other?\'

'A precaution.\' Harry gave her a small smile. \'Given that the potions master at Hogwarts is likely a Death Eater, or, at the very least, influenced by them, it feels prudent to try to create a ritualistic immunity to most poisons.'

\'Is that actually possible?\'

\'I believe so. I can imbue my body to magically resist poisons the same way you'd enchant a cup, it just comes with a higher price. That and I need to buy a few things from Diagon Alley.\'

\'I suppose that will at least get you out of the house.' Fleur wrinkled her nose at him. 'You spend all your time going over books. Either new ones for your NEWTS or old ones to find the Resurrection Stone.'

\'And horcrux hunting,\' he added.

Fleur tossed her hair over her shoulder. \'I\'m the one going to be doing all the hunting. Days and days of reading through Gringotts's files.\'

Sirius stumbled into the kitchen with a loud yawn. \'Harry!' A broad, mischievous grin spread over his face. 'I bring good news.\'

\'Oh?' He leant back on the kitchen side. 'That sounds highly

suspicious. Is the Order up to something?'

A small smirk crooked the corners of Fleur's lips. 'Scrambling to find their missing hero, no doubt.'

'Nothing so boring. Harry, you have a chance at the honour of being named the new head of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black.\'

\'I do?\' Harry raised an eyebrow. 'I'm waiting for the catch.'

'You do.\' A few more of Sirius\'s teeth became visible as his smile spread. \'My dearest mother has decided that there's nobody more suitable to carry on our family name, though she refuses to tell me why.\'

'Is there some kind of dark magic adoption ritual I have to undertake to join the pureblood elite?' Harry quipped. 'A drop of blood, a wave of a wand, a nice potion, and suddenly I have three extra names stolen from unsuspecting constellations, a body to die for, and talk like Malfoy.'

Fleur laughed. 'What's the actual catch?'

Sirius snickered. 'To be the head of my illustrious family, you must be able to produce pure-blooded children directly descended from the Black family tree. You are related through Dorea Potter, but not directly enough.\'

\'So I *can\'t* become the head of your family?\' Harry frowned.

'That's not a catch, that just doesn't work.'

Fleur folded her arms and levelled darkening irises upon

Sirius. 'That is not what he means.'

'You have to marry a daughter of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black,' Sirius crowed. 'And there's only one available...' His humour slipped. 'Not that she'd be keen on doing anything but hunting Death Eaters right now.'

*Nymphadora. Tonks. Little Nym.* Harry draggedall the names together into a single woman. *Part of the Order, Sirius's cousin and an auror good at finding people.*

\'I thought you were the last member of your family?\' He forced a light smile. \'If you\'re about to tell me you\'re secretly a girl and have been under a spell all this time, I\'m not going to believe you, and I\'m certainly not going to be flattered by your interest.\'

\'No!\' A scandalised expression crossed Sirius' face. \'I\'m far

too rugged and handsome to be a girl.\'

\'So there *is* a girl who fits the description?\' Fleur's soft, even tone carried no hint of danger, but her eyes were black as pitch. 'Is she particularly devoted to continuing your family?'

Sirius's smile vanished. \'She\'s a disowned daughter, whom my mother will graciously allow to return to the family tree because her skill as a witch is evidence that the Black blood has overcome any muggle taint. I can't imagine she'd seriously consider it for even a second.' He chuckled. 'No offence, Harry.'

\'Well, Harry?\' Fleur turned a small, gentle smile on him. \'Are you interested?\'

Harry took one look at her ink-dark irises and the small tufts

of white upon her forearms. 'Nope. I choose life.'

\'I shall convey your refusal, and my *I told you so* to my mother.\' Sirius laughed. \'It will, of course, make no difference to her plans.\'

Harry sighed. \'Wonderful.'

\'If you see Kreacher nearby, don\'t sign anything until you\'ve read it, even if you think you\'ve already read it,\' Sirius added.

\'Isn\'t he *your* house elf?\'

\'He\'s much more fond of my mother than he is of me. I was cruel to him as a child,\' Sirius confessed. \'He sees me as a traitor to the family he\'s devoted his life to.\'

\'Can\'t you just order him to stay within the house?\' Harry

asked.

\'Well I could.\' Sirius grinned. \'But it\'s far funnier not to.\' \'I\'m glad you find it funny.\' Harry grimaced. \'Does, er,

Nymphadora know about this?\'

\'Oh yes.\' Sirius\'s grin broadened. \'My mother\'s portrait went into great depth and detail in explaining it to her before the last meeting of the Order, including a solid ten minutes on how best to ensure she gets swiftly pregnant to ensure there's an heir for the family. I\'ve never seen Nym so flustered. I would've stepped in, but I think it might've actually helped her stop thinking about her parents.\'

'I think that I\'d quite like to meet your mother,' Fleur said.

\'The portrait\'s all but indestructible. I\'ve tried everything short of Fiendfyre, and I would've tried that if it wouldn't also destroy the wards on the house and bring the whole place down.\' A darkness flitted through his eyes. 'But when we no longer need that house, I'm going to raze it to the ground and spit on the ashes.'

Fleur glanced at the clock, then pressed her lips to Harry's cheek. 'I must go. Be careful with your blood magic, monCœur.' She flickered away.

*Off to see her cursebreaker.* Harry stamped out the thought and smothered the scattered images of Fleur, the shadows, and the

bronze ring burning on her finger like a circle of flame. *She won't*

*leave you. Gabby knows best.*

\'So how\'s everything going?\' Sirius asked. \'You still need to find some furniture.\'

\'Fleur's been choosing some, I think,\' Harry replied. \'I'll just arrange it when she's ready.\'

\'Lily never let James arrange anything,\' Sirius murmured. \'She had this thing about having everything in parallel lines or at perpendicular angles. We used to move things by a few inches just to tease her.\'

\'I didn\'t inherit that.' He cocked his head. 'Although Petunia

might have had the same thing, thinking about it.'

'Never liked *her*.' Sirius's face twisted like he'd bitten into something sour. 'And speaking of people I dislike, Dumbledore's still off doing who knows what. Moody and Tonks are in charge of finding you, but they\'ve not even come close.\'

\'And they won\'t, not unless Moody\'s creepy eye can see through the Fidelius Charm.\'

\'It\'s not foolproof, Harry. You should know that better than

anyone.\'

\'I know,\' Harry said. \'It\'s not the only ward placed over the

Meadow. I'm going to add some more in a moment now I've got you

here.\'

\'Anti-apparition wards don\'t keep out dark wizards for very long,\' Sirius said.

\'The Unyielding Shield Charm will. Fleur\'s more than just a pretty face.\'

*Much more.* His heart lurched. *So much more.*

\'That can be broken too,\' Sirius replied.

'Well, if they get through all those, then they'll still have to break the one I'm about to make.' He crooked a finger at Sirius. 'In fact, let's do it now.'

\'What sort of ward is it?\' Sirius asked. \'I don\'t know much about them, only that they\'re never as impregnable as the casters claim.\'

\'The sort that requires blood.\' Harry flicked his wand into his palm and strode through the hall and out onto the path.

\'Blood wards,\' Sirius murmured. 'Not the sort of magic most

witches and wizards would choose.'

'Blood is just a medium. And it's a good one.' Harry drew burning, purple runes along the walls and windows of the Meadow, leaving them inscribed in glowing, spiralling patterns across the stone. 'In this case, it's also the key, but it's not like I'm sacrificing virgins every other Thursday, Sirius.'

Sirius snorted, then a sly smile crept across his face. 'Do you even have a virgin to sacrifice, Harry? You and Fleur have been alone here together for a while...'

Heat crept onto Harry's face, but a tight, hot sense of pride coiled \'round his heart. 'I'm not going to dignify that with a response.'

'But if you did, you'd have a great big smile on your face.' Sirius chuckled. 'Lily would tan my hide for not making sure you were

a bit older before some girl got her claws into you.' He shrugged. 'Actually, she'd probably be too busy whaling on James for whatever stupid celebration he'd be pulling right now.'

'I killed someone when I was eleven.' Harry finished the last few runes and turned to Sirius. 'With my bare hands. I don't think clinging to chastity for a few more months would change anything.' He laughed. 'Well, it might've made Fleur cranky.' A small smile crept onto his lips. 'Or pouty. She's not a very patient girl.'

Sirius chortled. 'That really doesn't sound like the most terrible

thing, Harry. Not to be weird, but that girl is *stunning.*' 'I know,' he whispered. 'She's perfect.'

A faint frown creased Sirius's brow. 'So, this blood magic

ward?'

\'To enter requires blood the ward recognises.\' Harry

summoned the drop of Fleur's blood. 'And it only recognises those that use their blood to pledge themselves to the terms of the ward, or the three of us, who will be exempt.'

'What are the terms?' Sirius bit the side of his thumb and let

the blood run down the side of his hand.

'To attempt no harm on anyone within the wards.'

*A nice big loophole to hide any potential flaws.* He smothered a smirk. *Voldemort can come and visit us for lunch every day, but if he doesn't break the blood wards, then the only thing he can do any damage to is Fleur's dessert stash.*

Harry drew a drop of blood from Sirius's hand, then opened

his palm with a flick of his wand.

Sirius winced. \'So I have to lose blood every time I visit?\'

\'No. The ward will know when you try to cross whether your blood is allowed entry or not.\' Harry guided the drops of blood onto the runes over the mantle of the door, closing his eyes to avoid being temporarily blinded when they flashed a brilliant, bright white.

His godfather yelped with surprise and swore, squinting at

Harry. 'Couldn't have warned me?'

\'Consider it payback for bringing up your mother\'s plan in front of Fleur,\' Harry retorted.

\'I guess that\'s fair.' Sirius grinned. 'She *did* look pretty pissed. Did *not* realise her eyes change colour like that when she gets mad.'

thing.'

'Well. They do.' A faint smile crossed Harry's lips. 'A veela

'It's done?' Sirius pulled out his wand and healed his hand,

then turned to Harry. 'Huh. Beat me to it.'

Harry glanced down at the fading pink line on his palm. \'How\'s the Order faring?\'

\'The Order's torn between hunting for you and trying to help the Ministry counter the Death Eaters. Voldemort has many supporters, though most of the more dangerous ones were fortunately expelled from the Ministry after that debacle with Rita Skeeter. But it\'s chaos.\'

\'The Ministry is trying to give the impression they\'re

winning,\' Harry said. 'I'm not sure how true that really is.'

Sirius studied his wand. 'Tonks says they are, but the cost is much higher than the papers know. Voldemort's learnt from his mistakes, instead of fear-mongering to excess like last time, he's been directing his Death Eaters at important targets and throwing his other supporters at the hit wizards to wear them down. The Ministry's suffering, but holding out, and in a war of attrition the larger party wins.\'

\'He can\'t have *that* many supporters.'

\'You\'d be surprised,\' Sirius muttered. \'The Ministry has been influenced by his supporters, those like Lucius Malfoy, since he fell from power. They have constantly ensured groups like werewolves, vampires, and giants are oppressed and embittered.\'

\'And once they have turned them against the Ministry, they offer them emancipation on behalf of Voldemort,\' Harry said.

\'There are no flocks in Britain, vampires have never settled here in numbers, but the werewolf packs are united under Fenrir Greyback, and he follows Voldemort to take revenge against all wizards and witches who have oppressed them.\' Sirius rubbed his eyes and released a long sigh. \'And that says nothing of those he has swayed to his side in the hope of power; many minor pure-blood families hope for a share of the spoils once the Ministry is toppled.\'

\'So what *does* the Order do?\'

\'We pass information to the Ministry,\' Sirius said. \'Snape tells us what he can and we pass that on to Amelia Bones, then we assist wherever we can. There are relatively few of us, so we're limited to protecting that which Dumbledore deems most important.\'

Harry's lip curled. 'His martyr.\'

\'Yes.\' Azkaban\'s shadow hung under Sirius's eyes, a furious and feral light gleaming in his grey irises. \'Do you know what Dumbledore is off doing?\'

\'I have my suspicions,\' Harry admitted. \'There're a number of objects that are very important to Voldemort, destroying them is crucial, and I suspect Dumbledore is searching for them as we speak.\'

\'What else do you know about them?\' Sirius asked. \'I won't tell Dumbledore what I know, Harry. That meddling old man has sacrificed his last pawn if I can help it.\'

\'They're called horcruxes. They contain a fragment of Voldemort\'s soul, in a way. I believe there were three, but I've already destroyed two. Dumbledore is aware of one of those, the diary that possessed Ginny and opened the Chamber of Secrets was a horcrux.\'

\'What about the other?\'

\'Ravenclaw\'s Lost Diadem.\' Harry stifled a shiver. \'I found it in the Room of Requirement and destroyed it once I realised what it was.\'

*Although it took far too long for me to realise.* A prickle of horror crept down his spine. *And I nearly gave it to Fleur.*

\'I don\'t know anything about the third, but we\'re looking for

it.\'

\'We?\'

\'I have no secrets from Fleur,\' Harry said.

*Not anymore.* A green-eyed girl with silver hair beamed

from within her mother's arms before Harry's mind's eye. *Well, maybe one secret.*

\'Is there anything I can do to help?\' Sirius demanded. \'I feel

*useless* at Grimmauld Place.\'

\'Dumbledore must not know that I am aware of horcruxes,\' Harry warned. \'*Must not.*\'

\'That sounds like a no,\' Sirius muttered. 'I guess I'll try and distract Tonks. Keep her from sinking into dark places inside her head.'

\'You can keep a careful eye on Dumbledore,\' Harry suggested. \'If you can learn anything about the inner circle, especially one of them being given something to guard by Voldemort, then that would be *very* useful.\'

\'These horcruxes are the priority, then.'

\'While they exist, Voldemort can't truly die,\' Harry said. \'They have to be destroyed and he mustn't learn what we're doing until the very end if it can be avoided.\'

\'I understand.\' Sirius nodded. \'I\'ll keep an eye open and have a look in the library for anything that might prove useful. There\'s plenty in there about all kinds of dark and dangerous magic.\'

# The Fault in Our Stars

Books and files stamped in red-inked Gobbledegook sprawled across three desks. A score of white-feathered quills scribbled and scratched, sketching lines between paragraphs of her looped shorthand.

'Bloody hell.' Bill stuck his head around the tower of empty crates. 'At this rate, you're going to end up replacing my entire department.'

Fleur's lips quirked. 'I will not miss them.'

He grimaced. 'Yeah. I had a word with the boys today. Told them to back off or I'd do more than just yell at them. You might have to stick that ring I gave you on a different finger to really get them to shut up, though.'

*Harry really might kill you if I did that.* Fleur smothered a pang and the soft ache that followed. *He will learn to trust me with everything.*

'Merci,' she said.

He strolled over and scanned her writing. 'I can't read a single word of that.'

'You're not meant to.' She closed the files and books with a flick of her wand. 'They're between my beau and myself.'

'Your boyfriend?' Bill cocked his head and tugged at the dragon fang hanging from his ear. 'Not going to lie, Fleur, you can drop that whole thing with me if you like. I'd hope you've realised I'm not the sort to pester a girl.'

Fleur arched an eyebrow at him. 'Drop that whole thing?'

she echoed.

'Well. Yeah.' Bill shuffled his feet. 'I mean. Nobody's ever seen him...'

Fleur drew a small circle in the air with her wand tip. 'I think *you'd* be smart to drop *this* topic.' Her quills slowed to a halt, floated back to their little box and dropped home. The sheet of parchment folded itself up into a square the size of Fleur's palm and zipped into her fingers. 'You don't want me to lump you in with the rest of those idiots downstairs, non?'

Bill winced. 'Right. Not where I was going with that, Fleur. Just wanted to let you know you could trust me, because I wanted to make you an offer.' He fiddled with the fang, bouncing it on the ball of his thumb. 'Best to just say it, I suppose. Things in Britain are about to get dangerous. And, well, I know a few people, I can get you back to France---'

'I'm not leaving.' Fleur rose from her seat and slipped her wand away. 'There's *nothing* that will make me leave.'

Bill chuckled. 'Yeah. Had a feeling you'd say that. So... I don't know where you stay or what kind of protections you've got, but, well, my family's place, it's got pretty much the best wards you can find. And if you're alright with it, you can come stay with us. It'd make me feel better knowing you were safe.'

*He's a decent guy.* Fleur tossed her hair over her shoulder and studied the gleam in his blue eyes. *Not that he wouldn't try.*

'I appreciate it.'

'You'll come?' Bill perked up. 'My little sister would love to have another girl around the place. I've, well, a *lot* of brothers.'

'I know.' A small smile spread across Fleur's lips. 'I've met one of them.'

Bill blinked, then dissolved into howls of laughter. '*Ron.* Bloody hell. How did I forget that!?' He took a deep breath until his chuckles subsided. 'Well, he's grown up a lot, so don't worry about him. Man, I'm quite excited now.'

Fleur shook her head. 'I am not coming, Bill.' The grin slid off his face. 'You're not?'

'I am safer where I am.' Fleur hunted for a good reason. 'Your family, you're known to be friends of Harry Potter, no?'

'We were, but not anymore.' Bill's lips tightened. 'Ron messed that up. And after Dad died, I don't think Mum can see Harry the same way. Poor kid. Nothing much ever seems to go his way, wouldn't blame him if he just up and left one day.'

'It seems you're far more of a target than I am,' she said. 'And, while I'm sure you would be *perfectly* polite, I tend to refuse invitations like that on principle.'

He shrugged. 'Well, I offered. And the offer stands, so if you change your mind, just let me know.' Bill watched the last of her things tidy themselves away, his eyes dropping to her hand. 'Figured it out yet?'

'The ring?' Fleur twisted the warm band of gleaming bronze 'round her finger. 'Not quite. Nearly, though.'

'Oh?' A curious gleam welled up in Bill's eyes. 'Do tell. We have a betting pool downstairs.'

'The reason it doesn't seem to do anything is because the enchantment's not active.' Fleur pursed her lips. 'You have to have the right blood to activate it, apparently. Until then, the magic in it just swirls \'round and \'round instead.'

'Blood magic.' Bill's face darkened. 'Guess it's not such an innocent thing after all.'

'It's just a ring.' Fleur toyed with it for a moment or two, recalling the faint shadow in Harry's eyes when his gaze dipped to her hands. 'When I've figured it out, I'll give it back.'

'Keep it.' Bill waved a hand at her. 'Looks much better on you than if I tried to force it on one of my huge fingers.'

*I guess I could keep it.* Fleur checked the time. *It's just a ring.*

*And perhaps seeing it will help Harry learn to trust me.* 'Time for a slightly early lunch,' she said. 'Where are we going?' Bill asked.

'*I* am going to Diagon Alley.' Fleur swept past him toward the exit. '*You* can go wherever it is you would usually go.'

'Ouch.' Bill chuckled. 'Fancy some time by yourself, huh? Fair enough. I'll catch you later.'

She hurried out, ignoring the weight of Bill's gaze.

A scatter of small huddles drifted across the cobbles. A blond wizard with familiar green eyes watched her from where he leant against the wall of the bank.

*Waiting to see if I can recognise you?* Fleur rolled her eyes and strode over. *I could spot you a hundred times out of a hundred.*

Harry grinned. \'What's a hot bank like you doing in a dreary

girl like Gringotts?'

\'I\'m sorry.\' Fleur turned her nose up. \'Who might you be?\' His grin broadened. 'I am Tom Marvolo Riddle... but blond.\' \'Am I supposed to know who that is?\' She ran her eyes over

his features. 'You didn't put all that much effort into your face. Apart

from the nose and chin, you look almost the same.'

\'Tom has a new name now. A new face as well. And there

aren't many who wouldn't recognise either.\'

\'You\'re wearing Voldemort\'s old face around Diagon Alley.\' Fleur swallowed a little flutter of heat and sighed. 'Of course you are. I bet you were imagining me scolding you when you chose it, weren't you?'

\'You know me too well.\' Harry laughed, then his eyes

dropped to her hands and his smile faded. 'How's work?'

*Even after talking with Gabby, you're still afraid, aren't you?*

Fleur's heart sank. *Is there nothing you can truly trust in anymore, monCœur?* She stamped that thought out. *He will learn. I will make him trust me. However I have to.*

She waved her square of parchment at him. 'It was

productive, but not all good news.'

Harry dragged his gaze back up from the bronze band on

her finger. 'Research?'

Fleur stepped close to him and slid an arm \'round him. 'It's just a ring, Harry.'

He flinched. 'Sorry.'

'Why does it bother you so much?' she murmured. 'I stopped having lunch with him. I barely speak to him, though I didn't much before, yet you still stare at that ring like it's about to portkey me away somewhere.'

He stared up at the faint shreds of white cloud. 'I stumbled on a boggart when I went to meet Sirius before the fiasco at the Ministry. It took your form.'

'Scared of me?' Fleur narrowed her eyes at him. 'Or of me

doing something I would *never* do.'

A deep dark rose in Harry's eyes, looming over everything like the breaking crest of a great wave. 'You were *leaving.*' His voice caught and broke. 'And you had a ring on your finger. It was bright and gold as the sun. I can see it as clearly as if it was right here.'

Hot tears blurred on her lashes, heat bubbled in her bones and feathers prickled beneath her skin. 'And you didn't tell me?' She snatched the ring off her finger and stuffed it into her pocket. 'You kept your stupid secret and let me wear it in front of you all this time?'

His brow creased. 'You *knew* I didn't like it.'

'It's not the same.' Fleur smothered the heat trickling through her bones. 'It's not the same at all. I thought you were just struggling because...' She touched her fingertips to his cheek. 'Because you're *you*. And you've been letting me twist the knife in an open wound all this time.'

'The more it hurts...' Harry murmured.

*The sweeter it tastes.*

'You're an idiot, mon Amour.' Fleur rested her head on his shoulder. 'This is where your secret-keeping leads us.'

He stared up at the clouds and squeezed his eyes shut. 'How could I tell you? If I told you and you were upset, you might leave.' Harry's fingers curled into fists. 'And I *can't.* You *know---'*

'I know.' She pressed her lips to his cheek. 'It's gone. I won't wear it again. Now, let's go buy some furniture from Caratacus' warehouse.'

Harry groaned. 'Shopping?'

Fleur laughed and wiggled her fingers into his. 'We are in *dire* need of new furniture, Harry.' She hummed. 'Actually, I can't call you that, can I?'

'It's a common name, I'm sure---\'

\'I shall call you Marvolo,\' Fleur said.

Harry sighed. 'I suppose it could've been worse.'

'Much worse.' Fleur tugged on his hand and led him down the steps. 'Now, shopping time. It will *probably* be cheaper than buying me or Gabby sweet things.'

\'How hard can it be?\' Harry shrugged. \'We\'re just buying a bed, a few chairs, and some cupboards.\'

\'That, *Marvolo*, is why you\'re not choosing,\' Fleur said. \'There\'s all sorts of more complicated things to consider. There\'s the colour scheme, the time period, the style, the price, and then we have to arrange them when we get back.\'

\'I knew I should've stayed at the Dursleys\',' Harry quipped.

\'So where are we actually going?\'

\'There\'s a place on the North side of the Alley that enchants and sells furniture,\' Fleur replied, leading him across the street. \'What colours do you like?\'

'Blue.' He shot her a soft smile. 'Silver.'

Fleur's heart squirmed. 'Ivory? With pale wood and pastel blues?' She shot him a small smile. 'I may have already made some reservations...'

\'Or that.\' Harry grinned. 'The only thing I have good taste in is girls, according to you.'

'But you've managed to learn a little good taste from me.' She looped her arm through his and led him towards the door to the shop. \'Now it\'s time to buy some furniture for our home, Marvolo.\'

Harry screwed his face up and glanced around the chaotic store. \'I don\'t think shame and hate for his muggle relations were the only reasons Tom changed his name.\'

\'Marvolo is a wonderful name. His mother clearly had good

taste.\'

Mirth gleamed in Harry's green eyes. \'Well, if Riddle\'s father

looked anything like him, then his mother had very similar taste to

you.'

\'Sometimes a pretty face can make up for all the underlying personality flaws,\' Fleur jibed.

\'I sure hope so. Otherwise, I chose a hot bird-girl for

nothing.\'

\'The hot bird-girl chose you,' Fleur muttered. 'I *made* you

take me to the Yule Ball---\'

\'Out of pride and because you really overreact when you think someone is laughing at you.\' Harry peered through the stacks of furniture. \'Isn\'t there anyone else in this shop?\'

\'And I invited you to France when you weren\'t doing anything about us except sitting in that room moping,\' Fleur added.

\'Kidnapped,\' Harry said. \'You lured me there and trapped me. If I hadn\'t kissed you, I\'d probably still be stuck under our willow tree.\'

\'No.\' Fleur gave him her most innocent smile. \'The wind would've blown your ashes away by now. I would've been *very* upset if you'd messed that moment up.\'

Harry chuckled. 'Even Gabby might struggle with the romance of that.'

\'It worked.\' Fleur squeezed his fingers and pulled her hand free to ring the bell on the desk. \'You are mine now.\'

The chime echoed away through the chairs, tables, beds and ornaments into the dark at the back of the store.

\'I can\'t complain.\' Harry\'s smile softened and his eyes flicked past her shoulder. \'Oh, there *is* someone here. I was beginning to think this was a way for you to start crossing off rooms from your little list that we don't own.\'

A flush rose on her cheeks and Fleur twisted about.

Caratacus's thick glasses and stiff, white moustache tottered out from behind a copper-faced grandfather clock. She stepped back into Harry\'s chest.

His hands slid to her waist, pulling her back against him. 'Too late to cross the furniture warehouse off your list now,' he murmured in her ear.

Caratacus shuffled around behind the desk and fumbled through a stack of papers. 'Are you here to pick up and pay, Miss Delacour?\' He slid a sheaf of paper across, small images spun on the page before ever-changing backgrounds.

\'I am.\' She glanced at Harry out of the corner of her eye and wiggled her hips back into him a little. \'Do you like what you see, Marvolo?\'

Harry glanced at the furniture over her shoulder and nodded, then swept his gaze over her and shot her a suggestive grin. 'I *definitely* do.'

*It's a good thing Caratacus's hearing isn't great.*

\'This is for you and your friend, Miss Delacour?\' Caratacus

croaked.

\'His name is Marvolo,\' Fleur announced.

Harry\'s fingers slid lower down her abdomen, his fingertips

traced the hem of her underwear. A little shiver swept through Fleur and the sharp, heated gleam in his eyes flitted before the eye of her mind. She bit her lip and ignored the twist of desire curling within.

\'Wait...\' Harry glanced between the page and the nearest

and largest of the stacks. \'This is all for us?\'

\'Of course.' Caratacus fumbled a thin pair of glasses onto his nose and beamed. \'Miss Delacour has spent many hours choosing some of my finest pieces.\'

\'I\'m sure she has.\' Harry's fingertips crept a little lower.

Fleur could feel his smile against the nape of her neck and

nudged her elbow into his stomach. 'Not now,' she murmured.

*But plenty of time for that later.*

\'It looks perfect.' His hands slid back to her waist. 'Thank

you.'

\'I've had every piece of furniture enchanted as you

requested, Miss Delacour,\' Caratacus wheezed. \'You will find it quite hard to accidentally ruin or spoil any of these pieces.\'

\'Thank you, Caratacus.\' Fleur smiled. 'It would've taken me some time to do it all by myself. How much do we owe you?'

\'Five hundred galleons and fifteen sickles,\' Caratacus quavered. 'A signed letter of promise is always preferable to a mountain of coins.'

\'Of course.\'

\'I\'m going to have to shrink everything, aren\'t I?\' Harry grumbled.

\'Yes, you are. It will give you something better to do with your hands.\'

\'My hands were happier where they were,\' he murmured in

her ear.

\'The letter, Miss Delacour?\' Caratacus asked.

She flushed, then tugged out a piece of parchment and

drew up a letter of promise, signing it with a quick flourish. Harry leant past her and added his own name at the bottom with the tip of

his wand. A dust-free space stretched where the stack of furniture had been.

\'Thank you.\' Caratacus shuffled out of sight clutching the letter of credit in one wrinkled, veined hand.

\'What now?\' Harry asked.

\'We apparate back and arrange the furniture,\' Fleur said. \'Or, more accurately, we apparate back and you arrange the furniture where I want it while I enjoy my lunch break.\'

\'That feels unfair,\' Harry teased.

\'I chose it. All you\'ve done is shrink a few things and let your hands wander in the middle of a shop.\'

\'I didn\'t hear you saying stop.\' A soft chuckle slipped from

Harry's lips. \'In fact, the only response you gave was that little shiver.\'

Fleur let a small pout creep onto her lips and stuck her chin in the air. *Kiss me, monCœur.*

The corner of his mouth twitched, then he bent and pressed his lips to hers. 'You're a sneaky bird-witch, mon Rêve.'

She apparated them back into the hall of their home with a soft snap, throwing an arm around Harry\'s stomach when he staggered.

\'Now what?\' Harry eyed the empty spaces in their rooms and flopped onto the old sofa. \'Do you have a planned place for every piece?\'

\'Non.\' She laughed. \'Unshrink them and put them wherever you think looks best, we can move things around later this evening after I'm done with work. I shall fix the shower, too.\'

'*Finally.* Just because you\'re resistant to heat doesn\'t mean

the rest of us enjoy being scalded every morning.'

'I'll fix it.' Fleur flicked her hair back over her shoulder. 'Now, I've been combing through all the records I have access to at Gringotts. Nott, Avery, the Lestranges, Dolohov, Macnair, Yaxley and Travers are all on your list and have vaults, but there's very little available to read.'

\'They\'re all pure of blood, powerful, and well-off,\' Harry said. \'I believe Voldemort would've entrusted his horcruxes to those he thought were the most loyal and capable. If I were in the habit of giving pieces of my soul out, that\'s what I\'d do.\'

\'Those who went to Azkaban were likely the more loyal,\' Fleur suggested. \'Travers, the Lestranges and Avery were all imprisoned.\' She draped herself over the sofa, dangling her feet off the arm and dropped her head into Harry's lap. 'Their vaults are all right down at the most secure levels.'

Harry grimaced. 'And we're not going to be able to get our hands on them, since they're in hiding. I think our best bet is to go for someone on the edge and see what they know. Someone like Yaxley or Nott.\'

\'Nott?\' Fleur tossed her square of parchment onto the floor and flicked her wand; it unfolded and rose up into the air. She scanned her shorthand. \'He\'s the reclusive one who lives alone with his son since his wife died and always refuses to attend the sessions of Britain\'s Wizengamot.\'

'Theodore Nott's a Slytherin in my year.\'

\'How exactly do you intend to find out what they know?\'

Fleur asked. 'Maman isn't licensed for veritaserum, remember.'

\'Legilimency.\' Harry's smile turned slim and cool, faint danger gleamed in his green eyes. \'I\'ll tear the knowledge I need from their thoughts.\'

Fleur\'s stomach fluttered. His small smile tugged at her heart and curled her toes, igniting a soft, hot fire in her abdomen*.* 'We\'ll need to be careful. By all accounts, the inner circle are accomplished fighters.'

'We?\' Harry slipped an arm \'round her head and cradled her against him. 'I'd---'

'Don't even finish that thought.' Fleur twisted \'round and straddled his lap, resting her forehead against his. 'It is we. It's *always* going to be we, mon *Rêve.*'

Shadows flitted through his eyes, his brow creased, and the corner of his mouth turned down. 'It's not going to be --- we're going to --- we have to kill him.'

Fleur nodded. 'I know.' She slid her fingers into his hair and tugged his lips onto hers. 'I don't care. If we want to see our sunset, then we pay the price to get there. They would kill me if they could.' A cold chill rippled down her spine and clamped around her heart. 'And that's if I was lucky enough not to be captured.'

Harry's eyes turned hard and cold as ice, and he drew her close, cradling her head into the crook of his neck. 'Anyone that hurts you will *beg* me to kill them and end their torment. But I won't. I'll make it last *forever*.'

She took a deep breath and let the fear fade. 'We can pay him a visit at home. Gringotts has the address.'

\'Nott it is, then. You can get through the wards. I can beat Nott and his son.\'

A burst of fierce, hot pride flared within Fleur. \'When?\'

'Not long. The summer is trickling away and soon I'll have to be back under Dumbledore's nose. A few days.' Harry pressed his lips to the crown of her head and breathed in. 'Why do you always smell like marzipan?'

Fleur smiled into his collarbone. 'Because my perfume has almonds in it. Don't you like it?'

'Oh I like it.' He ran his hands through her hair, tugging and wrapping her silver locks \'round his fingers. 'I just wondered.'

She kissed his neck. 'I'm afraid I don't have time for anything that involves you pulling my hair, monCœur.'

'How disappointing.' He laughed and mussed her hair. 'I guess I'll have to ask Gabby about that veela harem instead.'

Fleur huffed. 'Not if you don't want your face melted off, you won't. She's bad enough *without* you encouraging her.'

'But I *enjoy* encouraging her.'

'I noticed.' Fleur swung herself out of his lap, straightened her clothes, and shook her hair out. 'Back to work for me. I've traced a few more branches of Peverells, but they\'ve all long since died out and none of their wills had anything that we'd be interested in.'

'Damn.' Harry's smile faded. 'Still, it's out there somewhere.'

*There aren't many branches left. And most of them are descended from the family the goblins refused to work with because they kept practicing incestuous marriages.*

'Somewhere. Enjoy arranging the furniture, mon Amour.'

Fleur pressed her lips to his cheek and apparated away.

# Unfortunate Alley for Some

A thin crowd trickled back and forth across the cobbles stretching from the fading glow of the enchanted menu to the shops, the patter of their boots echoing off the glass windows. Red umbrellas fluttered over sun-dappled tables and chairs and the faint scent of coffee drifted to Harry's nose.

'It is *really* quiet for the summer.' He drew his glass of water back away from Katie's elbow and swirled it until the bubbles formed a tiny whirlpool. '*You're* being really quiet.'

Katie turned a small frown on him. 'Because last time I saw you, you were worried about Frenchie messing around with some other boy. And now all you want to talk about is quidditch, which you *never* talk about.'

'Well, I'm less worried now.' He plastered a smile onto his face and smothered a knot of sour heat. 'You were right, nothing to ruin anything over.'

She studied his expression and sighed. 'I guess I saved that Firewhiskey for nothing.'

'Well...'

A faint smile flitted across Katie's face. 'Probably not a wise idea, Harry. Didn't end well last time. If you don't think Frenchie would be furious about you coming to drink Firewhiskey alone with me, then you're not a smart guy.'

'True.' He managed a grin. 'I'd get my face melted off.' 'Me too, I reckon.' Katie snorted. 'Me *first*, probably.'

'I certainly hope so.' Harry chuckled. 'I was planning on using you as a shield.'

'Some friend you are.' She poked him with the warm tines of her fork. 'You should bring her here, you know. I'd like to meet her, and her ability to eat cake without putting on any weight would be really helpful...'

Harry glanced back over the alley. 'Nobody's lingering to eat cake in the sun?'

'Not really. The Ministry is supposed to be putting wards up over here soon, though.' Katie leant her chair back onto two legs and tapped the fork against her palm. 'Did you hear about the Carrows?'

'No.'

*They're on our list, though.*

'They tried to go after Amelia Bones with some of Fenrir Greyback's followers.' Katie shivered. 'Aurors cut them to pieces before they even got halfway across the lawn.'

*Probably not smart or powerful enough to be trusted with a horcrux, then.*

'From what I heard, that's not a huge loss to society.'

'But if they're bold enough to go after the Minister...'

Harry grimaced. 'From what the Daily Prophet's been saying, more than a few people have started disappearing.'

Katie nodded. 'Mum says it was like this last time. She says

it will only get worse.'

'They're still losing.'

'Yeah.' She let her chair thud back onto four legs and set the fork back down on the table. 'Or that's what the Daily Prophet says, at least. I'm not sure I buy it, though. More people vanish every week. What if next time it's *you*?'

'If I disappear, it's because I ate Fleur's stash of sweets and got immolated.' Harry offered Katie a grin, slipping an arm around her shoulders when her frown didn't lift. 'Hey. I'll be fine. I *always* survive, remember?'

Katie's lips twisted and she squeezed her eyes shut tight. 'You know what I wish? I wish we could just wind everything back, right back to fourth year, so none of this ever happened.' Tears glistened on her lashes, a soft, sad scent suffusing the gentle smell of coffee. 'Would that be so bad?'

*Yes.* Fleur slipped away into the dark in the eye of Harry's mind and the little smooth, high voice in the back of his head rose up from his memories. *The only thing worse than never having had it would be to lose it after having had it.*

'No,' he said. 'But wishes like that don't come true, Katie.' 'Wishes never come true,' she muttered, smearing her tears

away. 'I'm sorry, Harry. I\'m being rubbish company. You go do your

shopping and remember to bring Frenchie here to meet me. Maybe you can even introduce her to Neville.'

*Maybe...* Harry toyed with the thought. *Everyone will know soon anyway if Fleur gets her way.* A knot of doubt tightened in his gut. *But the longer nobody knows, the safer she is.*

Katie stumbled out of her chair and dragged him into a tight

hug. 'Be careful,' she whispered. 'And come see me soon.'

'I'll see you soon.' Harry held her close in a rush of coffee and the faint tang of broom polish, then slipped out of her grasp. 'You be careful, too.'

'I\'m not important enough for anyone to go after me.' She mustered half a smile as she retreated back into the café with a small wave. 'It\'s that pretty blonde girl with the sexy accent you\'ll be worrying about.'

*I'll kill anyone who tries to take Fleur away.* Harry slid his wand from his sleeve and transfigured his face and hair. A crown of crimson tufts ruffled above Tom's face in the reflection in the water glass as he swept his hair to the left and smoothed it down. *I should get back to her. Don't keep her waiting.*

Harry hurried down toward Knockturn Alley, tugging a slip of paper from his pocket. *Myrrh, bloodroot, and vervain for the first ritual. Got those. Mistletoe, yew sap, a bezoar, and unicorn horn for the second. Also got those.* He glanced at the last thing on the list, then stuffed the piece of paper away. *Unicorn's blood. The only thing besides phoenix tears capable of curing any poison.*

He turned onto Knockturn Alley, stepping from the thin crowd onto quiet cobbles. Two hit wizards drifted along the street, boots ringing on the stones and their hands in their sleeves, and a scatter of rag-clad hags eyed them from the shadows, muttering together. The nearest snatched at his hair as he passed, but Harry caught her wrist and shoved her long, yellow nails away from his head.

*Does she know who I am?* He met her jaundiced eyes and formed a faint connection between their minds.

The bright flash of his hair came with heat, the tang of copper on the surface of his tongue, and a damp stickiness on his skin.

*Blood.* Harry squashed a flash of roses and kitchen knives, releasing her arm and pushing her back.

The hag quailed and fled back into the umbrae with a whimper.

He passed Borgin and Burkes', ignoring the display of dark curiosities and the flash of blond in the window, and strolling along the alley to the Spiny Serpent's boarded, bolted door. Stepping around a row of large vases, he walked along the thin gap between the line of vessels and the wall, pausing before a small, stained wooden door engraved in the rough likeness of a serpent.

\'Come in.\' A soft murmur drifted from beyond the door. \'I can hear you.\'

Harry pushed open the door and found himself standing before a skeletal, snow-faced figure. A faint copper scent hung beneath the thin smell of old books.

\'You look familiar,\' the figure whispered. \'Have we met

before?\'

*Not me, but maybe another with the same face...*

\'Not that I'm aware of,\' Harry said. \'I never forget a face.'

A gentle orange light settled over the shop, revealing a

circular stone room with two chairs at its centre.

\'What brings you to my shop then, young wizard?\' The owner blurred into the furthest chair in a single, seamless motion.

*That's faster than I can move after my ritual...* He shook out his sleeve and readied his wand.

\'I\'m seeking to buy something I might not be able to find elsewhere.' Harry took the other chair. 'It wasn't easy to find out about this place.'

*It took a lot of legilimency.*

'You have nothing to fear, young wizard.\' The owner tapped a slow deliberate rhythm on the arm of his chair with long, sharp nails and bared his prominent canines. \'I have run this shop for almost two centuries, as my sire did before me, and there are few things I cannot obtain. What have you come for?\'

\'Blood.\' Harry smiled. \'Uncursed unicorn\'s blood to be

precise.\'

\'Uncursed unicorn blood is hard to come by. The creature's

instinctive alchemy poisons their blood at the slightest touch of fear and their magic is potent.\' The vampire steepled his fingers. 'What price are you willing to pay?'

\'A single drop of blood will be sufficient for my purpose. As

you said, the magic of a unicorn is potent.'

\'Sometimes I ask for gold.\' The vampire's smile bared his long, curved canines. A coiled serpent marked the right, etched into the tooth in dark ink. \'Not always.\'

\'What are you asking for, then?' Harry leant his head to one side. 'I have little to give you but gold.'

\'Blood for blood,\' the vampire whispered. \'A fair exchange.\' \'My blood,\' Harry murmured.

\'I do not need any of the gifts of vampirism to feel the strength of the magic in you, young wizard,\' the vampire crooned. \'It's

plain to see. Your eyes glow with power. The eldritch effuses from you. Your blood will be an instant of bliss to me.\'

\'A drop of mine for a drop of your unicorn blood, then.' Harry slipped his wand from his sleeve. 'But you will have to drink it here. *Now*. I won't risk my blood ending up in someone else's hands...'

'Very wise, young wizard.' The vampire leant forward and extended his hand. 'I accept. There are few among my kind who'd pass up this chance.'

Harry took the ice-cold fingers and hid a wince as the

vampire's grip tightened like a vice. 'Go on, then.'

\'Yes,\' the vampire breathed. \'Of course. One moment, young wizard.\' He straightened from his chair, brushing the shadows aside with his fingers and slipping into a dark passage.

Harry waited, spinning his wand on his palm.

The vampire ghosted back in with a small glass vial no longer than the tip of Harry\'s finger in his hand. A drop of gleaming, silver fluid swirled within it. 'Very hard to come by, fresh, uncursed unicorn blood. Very... *precious.*' He extended his hand. 'Blood for blood, young wizard.'

Harry let the vampire take his hand, stifling a flinch at the flash of pain as the creature drove one of his long, sharp nails into the ball of his forefinger. A single bright, crimson bead welled up, bursting onto the curved underside of the creature\'s claw-like nail and filling it like a tiny cup.

The vampire dipped his long, pale tongue to it and shivered with pleasure. \'Take your prize.\' He passed the vial across with a red- smeared smile. \'Our business is concluded, young wizard. May you always walk in shadows.\'

Harry pocketed the vial and slipped from the shop, strolling back toward Diagon Alley.

A hand seized his arm.

Harry twisted and levelled his wand between the blue eyes of a bubble-gum-pink-haired witch in tight, burgundy-red robes. A strong wash of chai reached his nose as the breeze fluttered past her.

\'Found you,\' she sang, one eye on the tip of his wand.

*Auror robes.* Harry pulled an innocent smile onto his face and tucked his wand away.

\'Indeed you have. May I ask why you were looking for me?\'

The witch laughed. \'Everyone\'s looking for you, Harry. Your disguise is very good, but I\'m adept at seeing the real person behind a new face.\' Her hair faded to ebony and her blue eyes to grey, her cheekbones rose and her lips grew full, then her appearance shifted back. \'I\'m Tonks.'

*Little Nym.*

\'Ah...\' Harry plastered a grin across his lips and struggled for a plan of escape. \'My potential fiancée. It\'s nice to finally meet you... *Nymphadora*.\'

She scowled. \'Just Tonks! And how do you even know about

that?\'

\'I have my sources.\' Harry shrugged, but her grip on his arm

remained tight.

\'Are these the same sources that drew you to Knockturn

Alley?\'

\'No.\' Harry shook his sleeve out and eased his wand down,

catching its tip on the end of his middle finger. \'I was just curious.'

\'So care to tell me where you\'ve been?\' Tonks led him back into Diagon Alley with a firm hand.

\'I promised Dumbledore I would stay where I was safest.\'

Harry let himself show the small spurt of humour. 'So I did.'

\'The wards around Privet Drive keep you *far* safer than anything else could.\' Tonks's brow creased. \'Dumbledore said so himself. Didn't anyone tell you?\'

*Dumbledore lied*. Harry swallowed a bitter taste. *They keep me safe from everyone except Voldemort. They're not wards, they're a fishing hook, and I'm the worm wriggling on the end.*

\'I suppose he and I must've misunderstood one another.\' Tonks's lips thinned. 'I suppose so.'

\'So, now that you've found me, what're you going to do?\' Harry stretched, testing her grip on his forearm, but her hold didn't loosen. \'I\'ve pretty much finished shopping.\'

\'The Order would like to make sure you're safe. I understand you can apparate?\'

'I can.' Harry dropped his smile and let the lightness drain from his expression. 'But the only place I will apparate*to* is my current residence.'

'And where, exactly, is that?' Tonks demanded. 'We\'re supposed to be *protecting* you, not chasing you down while you\'re out shopping in crowds of potential Death Eaters.'

'I\'m afraid I can\'t tell you.'

'Can\'t, or won\'t?' Tonks pressed.

'If you can tell me where the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix is, I can tell you where I\'m currently residing,' Harry offered.

'I can\'t tell you that.' Tonks blinked and let out a low whistle. 'You\'re under the Fidelius too. That explains a lot.'

'And quite safe.'

Tonks's brow wrinkled deeper and she drew him to one side out of the crowd. 'So if you\'re safe, what have you been doing?'

'Practising for my NEWTs, mostly. I asked Professor Dumbledore if I could take some of them early, since I\'m quite far advanced in some subjects.'

'I\'ve never heard of anyone taking them more than a year early before. You must be *really* good if Dumbledore thinks you\'re capable of it.' She gave him a once over with a critical eye. 'Transfiguration's one of them, isn\'t it.\'

He nodded. 'The face?'

Tonks grinned. 'Yep. I\'m a metamorph, so I can do that naturally, but you\'ve done a spectacular job for just normal transfiguration. Dumbledore didn\'t think you\'d be able to hide the scar.'

'Well, I won\'t tell him if you don\'t,' Harry quipped.

Tonks gave a light chuckle. 'I suppose that\'s fair.' She chewed her lip and her hair wilted a little. 'It doesn\'t seem that there\'s all that much point in searching for you and moving you when you\'ve managed to do such a good job of hiding on your own. I\'ve

never seen Moody so embarrassed.' A huge grin spread across her face and her hair shifted to a bright, golden yellow. \'The famous Mad-Eye, hunter of dark wizards and witches, outwitted by a school student.'

'Maybe he\'ll be more vigilant now?' Harry suggested.

'I\'m not sure that\'s possible.' Tonks scowled. 'He yelled at me yesterday for tripping over a chair leg, not because I was being clumsy again, but because I didn\'t have my wand out ready to fight immediately afterward, in case I\'d been attacked by a dark wizard pretending to be a chair.'

'That does seem unreasonable.'

'He\'s good at catching dark wizards and witches, but not so

great at anything else anymore.' 'The Order needs him.'

'The Order needs Sirius\'s mother\'s portrait removed.

There're only two people she won\'t insult, you---' Tonks\' hair flashed rose-pink '---and me. Anyone else gets it straight in the neck. I pity the person who dares insult you in hearing distance of that painting. Snape was partially deaf for days, and I\'m sure I heard the words *pure-blooded scion of far greater worth than any who befouls and besmirches the house of my forefathers* echoing on the far side of London.'

'It\'s nice to be appreciated.' Harry grinned. 'What has she said to you about marriage?'

Tonks\'s face tightened and her hair turned black, all the cheer draining from her face and deep purple bruises welling up beneath her eyes. \'She was sad about my mum's death and glad to see *the Black blood* shine through. From what Sirius and my mum

said, she and her husband fucked the whole family up after *Bellatrix*

went insane.'

'Sirius said Bellatrix died a long time ago,' Harry murmured.

Tonks nodded. 'Mum always called her *ghost*. I don't know much about it, and I think Sirius and mum swore some vow or signed something, because they said they *couldn't* explain.'

'She's dead now.'

*I killed her.*

'Not many Blacks left,' Tonks whispered.

'Well...' Harry dragged a smile back onto his face. 'You know the only way to make more of them, *Little Nym.* Things need to be kept in the family.' He smirked. 'Quite *literally*, apparently.'

She choked. 'Number one. You are *waaaay*too young to be saying things like that to girls my age. Number two. Sirius is going to die for telling you about that nickname.'

Harry laughed. 'No number three?'

Tonks ruffled his hair with her free hand. 'No, my cute little baby cousin. I'm not marrying you. And I'm not fulfilling any of your fantasies either, you little sexual deviant you.'

'Shame.' Harry chuckled. 'I think you're just about my favourite cousin so far.'

'Just about?' A few strands of red glimmered in Tonks's hair. 'The other cousins you've met are Draco Malfoy, Narcissa Malfoy, and *Bellatrix*.'

'Well, I don't really have anything against Narcissa Malfoy.'

'Me neither.' Tonks shrugged. 'Used to avoid her, because mum did, but she used to try and get hold of me and mum all the time.'

'Bellatrix seemed to think she was sad.'

'I'd be sad if I was a Malfoy.' Tonks scowled. 'Enough family chit-chat, it's depressing. I'm *meant* to take you back to headquarters and wring some answers out of you, then put you back where you're safe, but if you're sure you're safe. *Very* sure you're safe*.* You can just answer some questions and I'll let you go. Don't really see why you have to spend the whole summer all alone without anyone to talk to but your muggle family. Sirius said they're pretty unpleasant people.'

'They're not great company.' Harry felt the smile slide off his face despite his best efforts to pin it in place. 'Ask your questions, but I'm *not* going back there. I'm *never* going back to live there.'

'First question, the big one, why did you leave?' Tonks

asked.

'I don\'t want to live with them,' Harry said. 'I would rather

live by myself in the Black Lake than with the Dursleys. And with the

Fidelius, I have no reason to stay.' 'And the memory charm?'

*I owed them oblivion.* He smothered the tight ball of cold about his heart. *They're lucky I don't care enough to do more than memory-charm them.*

'They hate the magical world.' Harry shrugged. 'I thought they'd be happier like this. Safer too, maybe.'

*Or maybe not.*

'How well protected is the place you\'re staying?' Tonks

cocked her head. 'Better than Privet Drive?'

'Way better. The Fidelius, anti-apparation, anti-portkey, and the Unyielding Shield Charm.' Harry weighed the next words on his tongue. 'Privet Drive only has *blood* wards. Remind me again whose blood Voldemort used in his resurrection ritual to nullify the protections my mother's magic left me with?'

'That's true...' Tonks's grip loosened, then she shot him a grin and made a show of releasing him. 'Alright. I won't drag you anywhere, but there's a condition. You and I, we're going to be good friends from now on, little baby cousin. You've got to come and meet up with me regularly so I know you're safe.' She tousled his hair and winked. 'I'll buy you ice cream...'

'I\'ll be back at Hogwarts in a month and a half, too.' A faint, acrid scent stung Harry's nose and the hairs on the back of his neck prickled. 'Is that smoke?'

'Hogwarts is the safest place in Britain.' Tonks sniffed the air and pulled her wand. 'That *is* smoke. I don't see anything, though\...'

*Safe now I've sacrificed Salazar.* Harry glanced back into Knockturn Alley. *Nothing down there.*

Gentle wisps of grey drifted on the breeze over the crowd in Diagon Alley, then flames exploded among the blue umbrellas of Fleur's favourite café, tossing burning chunks of table and chair across the street. Screams rang out through the thick swirl of smoke.

\'Morsmordre!\' A hoarse voice cried over the crackling flames.

A glowing green skull loomed over Diagon Alley and a volley of loud cracks tore through the street as the crowd scattered like frightened fish in Petunia's pond. Harry slipped his wand from his

sleeve and twisted to put his back against the wall. Dark-robed figures cast bright spells after the screaming, shrieking people and the reek of charred flesh stung his nose.

'Go,' Tonks urged. 'Apparate out now.'

'No,' Harry said. 'I can help. You can't fight them all alone.'

*And there might be someone from my list here.*

'Then stay behind me and watch my back.' Tonks cast anti- apparition wards over the alley and stepped toward the trio of Death Eaters, wand-raised. 'Don't get caught in a proper duel.'

*We're trapped, but the hit wizards probably won't be long.* Harry ran his eyes over two rune-patterned, shining, silver masks and a bare, bone-white one. *Silver must be inner circle. Plain white must be for the rest.*

'An auror...' One of the silver-masked wizards brandished

his short, thin wand at Tonks. 'And a blood-traitor to boot.'

'Yaxley,' Tonks spat. 'I should've guessed you\'d be here.

Where\'s your master, hiding in the shadows?'

'The shadows?' Yaxley glanced up at the Dark Mark hovering above them. 'The Dark Lord does not hide in the shadows, bitch. He rules them.'

'Then where is he?' Tonks retorted. 'I see you, Yaxley, and that's Avery on your left, but no Voldemort.'

'You dare say his name?' A smooth, high voice echoed from

beneath the plain mask.

*Fuck.* Harry's heart stopped. *That's him.*

'It\'s just a name,' Tonks said. 'I'm not afraid of a name.' 'There's power in a name,' Voldemort murmured.

*He's loving this.* Harry could feel the smile behind the pale mask, could sense the wry, cruel curve of that cold grin as Voldemort let himself taste the anticipation of the fear. *And now we're stuck in here with him until the hit wizards arrive or Tonks drops the ward.*

The mask burst into white smoke.

Voldemort's crimson gaze bored into Tonks's wide eyes and his lip curled. 'You\'re brave, Nymphadora Tonks, but being brave does not grant you *power*.'

'Neither does murdering people,' Tonks shot back.

Voldemort\'s gaze flicked to Harry and his lips quirked. 'You need to learn to transfigure your eyes if you're going to borrow another's face.'

'Aren't you going to leave?' Harry asked. 'Your point is made.

Everyone was very scared.'

'Not yet,' Voldemort whispered. 'In my absence, they have all forgotten the truth. While I have bided my time, their fear has faded. They no longer understand what I am to them, what the reality of this world is. I shall remind them. They will fear me as they did before.'

'I'm not afraid of you,' Tonks hissed. 'The hit wizards will be

here in a few minutes, then the Dementors will have your soul.'

'Avery. Yaxley. You two deal with... *Tom*.' A flash of wry humour played through Voldemort's crimson eyes. 'Brave little Nymphadora Tonks is mine.'

'It's Tonks.' Tonks raised her wand with a fierce gleam in her

eye. '*Just* Tonks.'

His lips curved into a cold grin. 'Of course it is.' Voldemort levelled his long, pale yew wand at her heart. 'I'm going to show you the difference between bravery and power, Tonks.'

'Crucio!' Yaxley cackled as the crackling beam of red burst against the wall behind Harry. 'Hurry up and die, boy. It's been too long since I watched the Dark Lord duel.'

Avery\'s glimmering bright-yellow spells hissed past Yaxley, scorching smoking craters into the cobbles. Harry flicked a pair of them away, batting them back at Yaxley, who hid behind a shining silver shield. A young wizard hurled himself through the broken glass of Ollivander's and into the fray, casting bright blue spells from his wand. Avery twisted through them, hurling pale green curses back, and Yaxley watched them burst upon his shield in washes of sapphire light. Green and blue magic clashed in showers of bright sparks until a teal spell seared through the young wizard's throat.

He clutched at the smoking wound with his wand hand, desperate light glimmering upon the blackened bone beneath his fingers, and crumpled onto his face.

'That was bravery,' Voldemort murmured. 'This\... is *power*.'

He unleashed a storm of spells.

'Bollocks.' Tonks threw the debris into their path with a wave of her wand and conjured up her shield.

The slim, silver bubble of light wavered beneath the barrage of curses, trembling like a candle flame in the rain.

*She can't hold for long.* Harry took a deep breath and reached for the fury within; ice so cold it burnt raced with thoughts of

the gleaming gold ring on Fleur's finger and the tall, broad shadow at

her side.

'Aguamenti,' he whispered.

The water twisted into a cage of ice spines around the pair of Death Eaters. Yaxley slipped and clung to the nearest spike, throwing up his shield as he struggled for balance. Avery summoned a gout of fire; it washed back from Yaxley's shield and set his robes alight.

\'Hold them off, Harry,\' Tonks gasped. \'The hit wizards will be here in moments.\'

\'You don\'t *have* moments,\' Voldemort hissed. A string of silver beads of light trailed from his wand tip and ghosted toward Tonks.

'Contusio,' Harry muttered, forcing as much magic as he could into the pinprick of silver at the end of his wand, then whipping it into the ice.

It burst like a thunderclap. White light seared Harry's eyes as Voldemort's spell exploded and a wave of force dissipated over Voldemort's animated serpentine shield. Avery skittered across the cobbles like a skipped stone, thudding into the wall, and Yaxley flew back into the frozen spines.

Crimson spattered across the pale ice as he jerked and gasped upon the spikes, his legs twitching and dangling as the blood soaked his front and pooled on the frosted ground. His rasping breaths faded and his thin, short wand clattered onto the cobbles.

A faint wash of heat rippled over Harry.

He threw up his shield and flooded the street with a cloud of conjured butterflies.

A raw, angry hail of spells descended upon the two of them; crackling, glowing Unforgivables and countless bright-coloured curses tore through the ice, the cobbles and the walls around them. Red umbrellas scattered like leaves before a storm. Shreds of crimson cloth drifted through the air as tables splintered and chairs shattered.

'Harry!' Tonks screamed. *'Harry!*'

Avery dragged himself up on the wall, clutching the

snapped stub of a wand. 'My Lord!'

Voldemort poured Fiendfyre down the length of Diagon Alley at Harry and turned to face Tonks. A bright, burning wave of roaring, red-tongued wrath swallowed the butterflies and turned the ice to steam with a deafening crack and a furious hiss. Harry thrust his magic into the billowing flames and twisted them into twin serpents, curving them 'round his body over the molten, glowing cobbles and burying Avery in a torrent of fire.

'Avada kedavra.' Voldemort's thin, cold smile and glowing

crimson eyes loomed over Tonks as she toppled to the ground.

Her hair shivered black, small curls tumbled over full lips, high cheekbones, and blank grey eyes that stared up through the smoke at the summer sky.

*She looks just like Bellatrix*.

'You killed two more of my inner circle.' Searing fury emanated from Voldemort's whisper. 'Wearing my own face, no less.'

'You killed Tonks.' Harry picked a safe spot between the molten stone and scorched craters, taking deep gulps of acrid, smoke-saturated air.

'Not *just* Tonks.' Voldemort's lips curled into a cold grin. 'You robbed me of Bellatrix, a loyal follower, and now...' His gaze drifted to the red umbrellas. 'Now we are even.'

*Katie.* Harry\'s blood ran cold.

'Go find her, Harry.' Voldemort's wand flashed up and Fleur's ring turned hot on his hand, crumbling to dust as Voldemort's magic wrenched Harry's face back into shape. 'Maybe she'll live long enough for you to watch her die, for you to watch her loyalty and devotion stolen from you.' Voldemort apparated away with a soft snap.

Harry sprinted through floating red tatters and drifting smoke. Panic stabbed at him with each flash of ruby and every glimpse of crimson cloth sent his heart spasming.

Brown hair trailed out from under the broken glass of the

counter.

Harry skidded to a halt and dragged the pieces of counter

away from the slow rise and fall of her chest. Broken glass sliced his palms, turning them slick and hot with red. *Katie\'s mother.* Relief flooded through him and he staggered to his feet, smearing his bloody palms clean on his thighs.

Cruel laughter echoed down the corridor and cold fury spread across his chest; his heart hammered against the icy fist clamped beneath his ribs. *If they\'ve hurt her...*

A hoarse chuckle echoed from within the shop.

He picked his way over the broken glass and paused before a pair of dead bodies in the corridor, sparing their pointed teeth, sharp nails and coarse hair a glance. *Werewolves.*

\'There\'s something ever so satisfying about using an axe,\' a thick, brutish voice said.

*Macnair.* Harry stepped over the corpses. *He's the creep*

*who loves axes.*

A third body shuddered against the wall, clutching at a gaping neck wound with pale hands. 'Kat-tie,' her father gasped, blood spurting from his throat as he waved his hands down the hall. 'Kat-*tie!*'

'VulneraSanentur,' Harry muttered, pouring magic into the wound until it closed and the bleeding slowed. 'Obliviate.'

*Best if he doesn't remember I was here. Just in case.*

'It\'s the *sound*,' Macnair crooned. 'The way severing bone

trembles up your arms and the blood sprays across the floor.'

Harry tip-toed through the red pool surrounding Katie's father. *They\'re dead. They\'re all dead. None of them would be trusted with a horcrux anyway.*

'Hold still sweetheart,' Macnair growled. 'It\'s cleaner if you

don\'t wriggle.'

'Are you sure I can\'t turn her?' Another voice rumbled. 'Yes,' Macnair snapped. 'The Dark Lord said she was to die.'

Harry prowled \'round the corner. Two Death Eaters stared down at where they'd pinned Katie to the wall by conjured ropes. She caught sight of him and froze.

'That\'s better.' Macnair flicked his wand and the ropes tightened, cutting into Katie's skin. 'Best to just give in and get it over with.'

The other Death Eater snorted. 'Would rather she gave in and we had some fun with her first. Everyone wins. We get to fuck this little sweetheart until she's too sore to scream and she gets to live a little longer.'

'I kill.' Macnair conjured an axe of dull bronze metal from the end of his wand and raised it above his head. 'Hunters kill. I'm not some lowlife shit-stain like you.'

Harry levelled his ebony wand at Macnair and the words welled up on his tongue, cold as ice, but sweet as sugar. 'Avada kedavra.'

Macnair crumpled, the axe and ropes vanishing. Katie scrambled to her feet and bolted from the room as the other Death Eater twisted around. Harry's splintering curse burst the man's wand arm like a balloon, spattering red across the wall.

'Wait!' He groped at the spurting stump and sour urine stung Harry's nose. 'Please. *Please.'*

'Wait?' Harry thought of Katie's wide terrified eyes and pale face with searing cold coursing through his veins. 'Alright, let's have some *fun.'* He took a step closer and drove his heel into the man's face, shattering the plain, white mask. 'I get to vent some anger until you're too hoarse to scream and you get to live a little longer.

*Everyone wins*.'

The colour drained out of the Death Eater's face and his green eyes went wide as galleons. 'You --- you *can't.*'

'I've more than enough hate,' Harry whispered. '*Crucio.*'

The Death Eater's screams rang down the hall as he writhed in the blood and broken glass. A foul reek filled the room and his heels kicked against the floor, tearing the carpet.

Harry let the curse fade.

'No more,' the man pleaded. '*Please.*'

'Can you still scream?' He raised his wand.

'No. No, no, no. *No.*' The man thrust his tongue through his teeth and bit it off. Blood spurted through his lips and dribbled down his chin. He shook his head, gargling red and garbling words.

A soft step came from behind Harry.

'Lacero.' Harry opened the man's throat and spun \'round.

Katie stared from the door, white-faced and trembling.

'Harry...' She reached out one hand.

He slipped his wand back up his sleeve. 'It\'s just me, Katie.' Harry raised his palms and took a slow step toward her. 'You're fine. They're not going to hurt you. They *can't.*'

She darted across the broken glass and buried herself in his chest. The soft whiff of coffee rose from her hair as she sobbed into his ribs.

'It's ok,' he murmured, cradling her against him and

smoothing her hair. 'You're safe.'

Her shaking faded and her breathing grew steadier, but she clung to him so tight his ribs ached and he could feel the hammering of her heart against his breast.

'You do scary things when I get hurt, Harry,' Katie whispered. 'First Malfoy, then *this*.'

'They all deserved it.' Harry leant back to look down at her. 'Are you hurt? What did they do?'

She shook her head against his chest. 'The one with the axe tied me to the wall, that was all.'

'I got here just in time, then.' Harry felt her fingers twist in his clothes and cupped her hands with his own. 'Have you got somewhere you can stay? Somewhere safe?'

*They came for her. They somehow knew her address.* The ice tightened in Harry's chest. *Snape would know her address. The school has to know it and he's a professor.*

A loud series of cracks rang outside.

*Hit wizards.* Harry glanced at the bodies sprawled on the floor. *I'd better leave.*

'Katie?' He gave her fingers a squeeze. 'Is there somewhere you can go?'

'I can stay with Angelina and Alicia.' She glanced up, the tip of her nose brushing against his and her lips grazing over Harry's.

Katie's breath caught. 'I---'

'Go straight to Angelina and Alicia.' Harry pulled her into a tight hug and brushed her hair off her face. 'Wait for the hit wizards, then go there. Your parents were badly hurt, but I think they'll be fine after some time in St. Mungo\'s.'

'Don't --- Don't go.' Katie's whisper tickled his lips. 'Don't leave me.'

Harry winced at the stab of guilt. 'I *can't* stay, Katie.' He gestured at the bodies on the floor. 'You're safe now. And I need to get back to Fleur.'

She stiffened, slumping to rest her forehead against his collarbone. 'Of course you do. She's probably worried, isn't she?' Katie slipped back out of his embrace. 'Be careful, Harry. I lo --- I look forward to seeing you soon.'

# Complications

The branches of the Peverell family tree spread in lines of gentle purple flame from the mark of the Deathly Hallows upon the ceiling. Countless lines of Harry's cramped handwriting covered the pages plastering the walls.

Harry crouched down and traced the only green line to where it ended at knee height beside the door. 'Gaunts. The same family that couldn't claim that dowry...' He skimmed the names. 'And apparently also the one that was a bit too fond of marrying each other.'

*So fond of it they broke the law and the goblins refused to deal with them.* He scowled. *Which means Fleur can't check their records to see what they owned. Not that it seems they owned much from the state of their vaults before they were kicked out of Gringotts.*

'Have you eaten anything?' Quiet footsteps echoed along the corridor and the slim curve of Fleur's legs appeared in the corner of his eye.

He grimaced. 'I may have forgotten.'

She tutted. 'Stop staring at your terrible wallpaper and eat.' Fleur poked him with her toes. 'Knowing you can't look after yourself, I brought you some food.'

Harry jumped to his feet.

Fleur thrust a plate of small croissants into his face.

Midnight blue eyes met his. '*Eat.*' She pushed him back into a chair and settled into his lap. 'I'm not going to keep helping you if you let

this swallow you up. If I have to, I'll drag you to work with me under that cloak.'

Harry snorted. 'Your curse-breaker friend will be heart-

broken.'

She rolled her eyes. 'Heart-broken boys aren't my problem.' Her irises faded to summer blue. 'With one exception.'

Harry shot her a grin. 'You found a bird-man?'

Fleur glowered at him. 'I hope one day you get to find out you're a bird animagus, monCœur.' She tapped the plate of croissants with her fingernail. 'And you're still not eating.'

Harry dipped one end of a small croissant into the pot of honey and wolfed it down. 'Happy bird-witch?'

She laughed and pressed a kiss to his lips, stealing the honey off them with the tip of her tongue. 'Happier.' Fleur snuggled into the crook of his neck. The warmth of her soaked into him and she patted her bare feet against the floor. 'What're you up to today?'

He shrugged and munched his way through the croissants. 'I should probably go visit Katie. Make sure she's ok. Other than that, I was planning to brood in here and then try to seduce you in the hallway. I think that's the only room left on the list.'

Fleur's lips brushed his neck. 'There's also the bathroom...'

'I thought we already ticked off the bathroom that morning a few weeks back.' A smile crept onto his lips. 'And a few times more afterward.'

'They don't count.' She leant back and stared up at him through dark lashes. 'It only counts if we start *and* finish in the same room.'

'I didn't realise there were rules.'

'There are.' Fleur shifted in his lap and shot him a coy look.

'The bathroom's just down the hall...'

Harry's gaze dipped to the loose cleavage of her blouse and he slid the plate away across the desk. 'I promised I'd go see Katie this morning.'

The blue of Fleur's eyes darkened by a few hues. 'Tread carefully, monCœur. I am a *very* jealous bird-girl.'

'I\'d noticed.' Harry's hands slipped to her waist and pulled her against him. 'And I'm fairly sure you can feel how much I'd like to delay my visit by a couple of hours, but she's been through a bad week, to say the least, and only because she's remained a loyal friend to me.'

'Mmmm.' Fleur hummed and circled her hips until Harry twitched. 'I suppose I can be patient for a few hours. I don't have much to do, though, I sorted the wards yesterday.' She cocked her head and tossed her hair back over her shoulder. 'Perhaps I should come with you?'

*You still want to meet Katie...* Harry wrestled with a knot of anxiety, then smothered it. *There's no reason for me to say no. We're just friends. There's nothing that can go wrong.*

'Katie did say I should bring you,' he remarked. 'I guess you can come surprise her.'

no.'

Fleur huffed. 'You mean you can't think of a good reason to say

Harry twitched. 'A little bit that, yeah.'

'One day, monCœur, you're going to realise that there's really

nothing you can do that will get rid of me.' She pressed a soft kiss to his lips. 'I'm *certainly* not going to get put off by anything the girl you dated before me might say.'

A little rush of warmth filled him and he tugged her tighter

into his arms. 'You really are perfect, you know.' Fleur stuck her nose in the air. 'As always.' 'I certainly hope so,' he murmured.

She jumped out of his lap. 'Let's go, then.'

Harry staggered out of his chair. 'I just need to sort out my

face.'

'Non.' Fleur smoothed her blue dress down and shook out her

hair. 'Leave it.'

'Everyone will recognise me...'

*Everyone will see me with you.* The knot tightened in his gut.

*And once they know, they'll try and take you away. Like always.*

'Good.' She slid her arm \'round his waist. 'I'm not some secret *mistress* to be hidden away and snuck back and forth from, and it's not like we're not about to start picking fights with Death Eaters and going after horcruxes anyway, is it?'

Harry grimaced. 'I can't argue with that logic.'

*Let's hope there's nobody inside to see us.*

'But you want to,' Fleur muttered under her breath. 'Otherwise I wouldn't have to twist your arm into appearing in public with me.'

Harry winced. 'Sorry.'

She sighed and leant her head on his shoulder. 'I know. You can't help it.' Her eyes darkened a fraction. 'I will forgive you for it, probably forever, because you're you.'

'I'll buy you some cake at the café?' Harry shifted his weight. 'Will that make it up to you?'

'It'll definitely help.'

Harry wrenched the world back past them and stepped into Katie's family's café. 'It's a good thing you're so easily bribed, mon Amour.'

A small handful of chairs rested upon the tables surrounding the half-empty counter and blank spaces marked the shelves and walls where pictures and ornaments had once stood.

'Harry!' Katie bounced out of the corridor beyond the counter

and stopped dead in her tracks. 'And you must be Fleur.'

'I'm definitely Fleur.' Fleur's fingers curled into Harry's shirt. 'It's nice to finally meet you, Katie.'

Katie drifted around the edge of the counter. 'Harry's talked about you a lot, I feel like I already know you.' She beamed. 'I hope he warned you that you're here because we have more cake than we can eat.'

Fleur's lips crooked. 'He did promise to buy me some.'

'There's no such thing as more cake than Fleur can eat,' Harry quipped. 'She's like an acromantula when it comes to sweet, edible things.'

Katie giggled. 'That's not true. Fleur has much nicer legs.' 'And fewer eyes.'

A soft laugh escaped Fleur's lips. 'I don't---\'

'Is Harry finally here?' Nev stepped out of the corridor and turned bright red. 'Oh.'

*Merde.* Harry's stomach clenched. *Katie knows not to tell*

*anyone, but Nev doesn't.*

'Neville's also here.' She waved a hand out at Diagon Alley.

'He got nervous about his *date* and turned up an hour early.'

Nev glanced back and forth between Fleur and Katie, a deep frown on his face.

'His date?' Harry asked.

'Hannah...' A little wicked gleam appeared in Katie's eyes. 'I've been teaching him how to impress a girl.'

Nev's face turned an even brighter shade of red. 'Please don't.' Harry laughed. 'You've been tormenting him with innuendo,

you mean.'

'As if you wouldn't have joined in like usual.' Katie flapped a hand at one of the tables. 'Give me a moment, we can sit here.'

Harry slipped his wand out and flicked it at the table. The four

chairs flipped off and settled upon the floor. 'Done.'

Nev sidled out of the corridor and into the seat in the corner.

'W-what brings you t-to Britain, Fleur? I-it's not exactly s-safe.'

'I am with Harry.' Fleur chose the chair opposite Nev and crossed her legs, drawing Harry into the seat by the window. 'I have been for a while, but he likes to keep things to himself.'

Katie's smile crumbled and she dropped herself into the chair opposite Harry. 'He sure does.'

Harry glanced between Katie and Nev, tracing patterns

across Fleur's palm with his finger.

'You can ask,' Katie murmured, catching Harry's eye. 'Neville already knows you know.'

'How's everything?' Harry asked.

'It's ok. Dad's off duty until he's fully recovered and Mum's fine. We're just a bit shaken up.' Katie watched Harry's finger circle Fleur's hand. 'Good thing you were there.'

'You were there?' Nev's gaze snapped up. 'What happened?'

\'Walden Macnair wanted to take Katie\'s head off with an axe,\' Harry said. \'I stopped him. I quite like Katie with her head attached to the rest of her.\'

'You'd miss my pretty face,' Katie joked. 'Who else would you get to tie their hair up for you after you'd lured them into a trick step if I was headless?' She giggled. 'You'd be *head-less,* too.'

Fleur stiffened and Harry winced.

*Was that really the wisest joke to make?* He stifled a sigh.

*Fleur's going to make me pay for that.*

\'You stunned him?\' Nev frowned. \'He\'s still out there?\' \'No. I killed him.\'

'I guess I should've expected that.\' Nev's lips twisted. \'You seriously injured Malfoy when Katie's ribs got broken, no wonder you killed someone who wanted to behead her.\'

Fleur's fingers curled \'round Harry's hand and tugged it across in front of her. 'I remember reading about that. Rita Skeeter liked to write about Harry a lot, and not just Harry, either.'

Katie turned a little pink and stared down into the table.

'There was absolutely *no* truth in that article.'

Nev's gaze slid to Fleur, then he tugged his eyes away and his brow wrinkled. 'Sorry,' he muttered. 'Harry taught me some occlumency, but I didn't think to use it.'

\'How does it work?\' Katie leant forward, a curious gleam in her eye. 'I remember all the boys going weird around you except for Harry back in Fourth year.'

Fleur stared at Katie, toying with a lock of her silver hair until Katie squirmed in her chair. \'It\'s a compulsion. My magic naturally inspires people to desire me, though it requires them to be looking at me. The more focused they are on me, the greater effect it has. My allure's stronger than most.\' A touch of pride coloured her tone. 'I can enthral anyone who doesn't know how or isn't inclined to resist without trying. It's not normally so.\'

'But Harry wasn't affected.' Katie chewed her lip. 'Or any

girls.'

'Surely *some* of the girls,' Harry quipped. '

'Harry's all but immune because of his proficiency with the mind arts.\' Fleur pouted. \'Even my best attempt to ensnare him makes no difference unless I catch him off guard. And girls, well, unless they're already interested in other girls, they won't feel it so much.\'

\'You tried to charm him?\' Katie's voice rose an octave.

\'I was curious to see how resistant he was,\' Fleur replied. \'So was Harry, for that matter.\' Her eyes darkened to midnight blue. \'I didn't enthral him for so much as a second. I don't *need* magic for that.'

Nev cleared his throat. 'Harry, is it alright if we talk for a moment?'

Harry glanced between Katie and Fleur. 'Definitely.'

Nev pushed his chair back and stepped into the corridor.

Harry squeezed out around Fleur, pausing to bend to her

ear. 'Don't be too jealous, mon Rêve. Katie's my best friend.'

Fleur leant her head back into his stomach and gave him a

small, warm little smile. 'I'll be nice.'

Katie twitched and caught Harry's eye. He winked at her

and her shoulders relaxed a little.

Nev's deep frown held a glint of anger. 'You never told me about Fleur.'

'I didn't tell anyone.' Harry studied the gleam in Nev's eyes. 'Katie only knows because I slipped up.'

'So you don't trust us.' Nev's face tightened.

Harry suppressed a flicker of irritation. 'Voldemort *sent* Macnair after Katie because she's my friend. The fewer people know about Fleur, the lower the risk of her getting hurt.'

Nev relaxed a fraction. 'Then what's going on with you three? You and Katie have your *thing* and then suddenly, out of nowhere, you're with Fleur.' He lowered his voice to a whisper. 'I saw the photos in the room, but I thought you'd gotten over her and got back together with Katie.'

'That's not what it is.' Harry shook his head. 'Forget about it. It's nothing to worry about. Fleur's my girlfriend and Katie's my best friend.' Harry shot a glance back toward the table at Fleur's tense shoulders and Katie's squirming. 'We should go back.' He pinched a slice of chocolate cake from the counter as he returned.

'Yeah.'

Katie looked up as they re-joined the table. 'Had a nice little chat, boys? Decided which of us has the best boobs?'

Nev sputtered and went pink. 'That's --- that's *not* what we

were talking about.'

Harry snorted and slid the cake over to Fleur. 'Fairly sure I remember you saying Fleur had you beat, anyway.'

Katie huffed. 'We can't all be sexy French veela.' She flashed a grin at Fleur. 'No offence.'

Fleur's lips pursed. 'None taken. It's true.'

Harry inclined his head toward the cake. 'How much do I owe you?'

'Nothing.' Katie turned a little pink. 'You *did* save my life. And probably my parents' lives too. The *least* I can give you is free cake.' A wicked glint appeared in her eye. 'Unless, of course, you'd prefer I repay my life debt some *other* way.'

Fleur twitched and caught herself in the lip with her fork.

'*What?*'

Nev pulled a menu across in front of his face.

Katie beamed. 'Fleur's very pretty and has very nice legs, I

don't mind sharing her with you, Harry.'

'I'm not very good at sharing,' Harry retorted. 'I'm an only child. Blame Voldemort.'

'Now I understand why you and my sister are so good at coming up with silly things.' Fleur put her fork down. 'You've been practising with Katie.'

'Gabby is better than both of us,' Harry said. 'For a horrible moment I thought she was telling me the truth about that veela enclave thing.'

Fleur laughed. 'You should be so lucky. There are no nudist veela colonies waiting in southern France, Harry. And even if there *were,* you *still* wouldn't have to pretend to be married to both me *and* my sister to get in.'

'It was that last bit that gave it away,' Harry said. 'She had me going until then.'

Katie's smile slipped a fraction. 'And here I thought I was the only one who teased him like that.'

'Not anymore.' Harry grinned. 'But you did get there first.'

Katie giggled. 'I suppose being your *first* is still something to

take pride in, right, Fleur?'

Fleur's cheeks turned pink, but she stuck her chin in the air. 'I

*certainly* enjoyed it.'

'Cradle-snatcher,' Harry whispered in her ear. 'I wasn't even

sixteen.'

'It was close enough,' Fleur whispered back. 'And I bet that

time-turner made up the difference anyway.'

Nev cleared his throat and re-appeared above his menu. 'Can we --- er --- not talk about this? I have to go meet Hannah and I really don't want my head to be full of veela enclaves; I'll say something stupid and ruin it.'

'Fair enough.' Harry leant back in his chair. 'What're your remaining summer plans, Nev? Besides sweet-talking Hannah. I'm studying for my NEWTs.'

\'And repainting the door to the house,\' Fleur added, picking her fork back up and taking a mouthful of chocolate icing.

\'And that.\' Harry rolled his eyes. \'I\'ll do it eventually, but it doesn\'t *really* need it.\'

\'It\'s a terrible colour,\' Fleur said. \'This country is not warm enough to merit so much white. I would like a blue door.\'

\'I haven\'t found the right colour yet,\' Harry said. 'There's a certain shade of blue I've got my heart set on\...'

Fleur shot him a soft look and paused in her demolition of the cake to squeeze his hand.

\'You sound so grown up,\' Nev muttered.

'Well, *I'm* going to come up with some new amusing rumours to scare firsties with,' Katie said. \'Luna Lovegood will help, she comes up with some of the best ones.\'

\'Which ones were hers?\' Nev asked.

Katie giggled. \'My favourite was the one where Voldemort\'s real mission was to seduce as many girls around our age group as possible to prevent the pure-blooded lines from ever being lost.

However, because he himself is impotent, he had to create Harry to do it for him, and everything else is just an elaborate cover to fool Dumbledore, the Ministry, and the Witch Weekly magazine, who've opposed Voldemort since discovering his terrible secret.\'

A peal of laughter burst from Fleur's lips. \'You are not very good at your mission, Harry. You\'ve seduced one girl and she\'s far from pure-blooded.\'

\'I think I need to talk to Luna,\' Harry said. 'All that terrified blushing suddenly makes a lot more sense.'

\'It\'s okay, Harry.\' Katie beamed. \'We warned them off. Told them all you were also impotent.\'

Harry snorted. 'Thanks...'

\'You should probably try warning Romilda Vane once or twice more.\' Nev sniggered. \'I\'ve overheard talk of love potions.\'

Fleur's eyes narrowed and she scraped the remaining chocolate crumbs and icing off the plate with white knuckles. 'Love potions are nasty things.'

'Who the hell is Romilda Vane?\' Harry asked.

\'Dark-haired, not unattractive, a year or so younger than us, and apparently quite a dab hand at potions.\' Katie giggled. \'I\'d watch your food, Harry, and your back, or she\'ll be dragging you into broom closets after quidditch.\'

\'Thanks, Katie, but it won\'t be the first time I\'ve been offered something inappropriate by a girl after quidditch.\'

Katie flushed pink. 'I wasn't *serious.*'

\'You should probably keep an eye out for potions, though,\' Nev said. \'I don\'t think she was actually joking.\'

\'Really?\' Katie\'s tone switched to something so hostile it was normally reserved for addressing Slytherin\'s chasers. 'She actually *meant* it?'

\'Yeah...\' Nev grimaced. \'Come to think of it, she knew an

awful lot about Amortentia, too.\'

\'I\'ll keep an eye out,\' Katie growled. \'If anyone tries anything like that I\'ll test my human transfiguration on them. Romilda can spend a few hours as a parakeet or a flamingo. I\'ll take her to the lake and feed her to the squid\...\'

Harry laughed. \'Isn\'t she just an adorable little Dark

Mistress?'

\'Quite,\' Fleur murmured, her eyes darkening. He winced. *Maybe this was a bad idea.*

\'A mouse,\' Katie decided. \'I will feed her to Professor McGonagall.\'

\'And on that note,\' Harry said, rising out of his chair. 'We

should go back home and Nev needs to get to his date.\'

Katie slid out of her chair, smiled her goodbye to Fleur, then wrapped her arms \'round Harry. 'Thanks for finally bringing Fleur to meet me,' she whispered. 'Stay safe.'

Harry held her close and breathed in a soft tang of broom polish and coffee. 'I'll be careful.' He mussed her hair. 'You be careful, too. Anyone close to me is a target now.'

\'You have a door to paint,\' Neville quipped, patting Harry on the shoulder.

\'You have a cactus to look after,\' Harry retorted. \'Have you explained the name to your gran yet?\'

Nev paled. 'She\'ll know as soon as she meets Hannah. And then she'll tell all her friends. They\'re all on the Wizengamot. The entirety of Britain\'s government will know why I named my cactus Hannah.\'

Katie\'s giggles drowned out the soft snap of Harry's apparition. Fleur appeared beside him and caught his hand on the door.

\'I\'ll paint it tomorrow, I promise,\' Harry said.

\'Thank you.' A faint smile flitted across her lips. \'But that\'s not what I want to say.\'

\'Then say it.' His stomach churned. 'You're making me

nervous.'

\'It will make things more complicated,\' Fleur murmured.

\'I\'d rather hear it than not.' \'She still likes you.'

\'Who?\' Harry blinked. \'Katie? We talked about it more than a year ago. She said we could just be friends.\'

*Or something like that.* His gut twisted itself into a knot. *She*

*can't still like me. It's been ages.*

\'She lied,\' Fleur said. \'I could almost *taste* how much she wanted to be where I was.'

'That doesn't make any sense.' Harry shook his head. 'Not after that article. Not after she told me to go talk to you when I was getting all worried about that curse-breaker.'

Fleur held his gaze. 'She loves you, but she wants you to be happy.' Something horribly fragile hovered in her eyes. 'You'll see. At some point, she won't be able to resist. The moment she can convince herself you'd be happier with her than with me.'

Harry tugged her into his arms and held her close. 'I don't believe you, but it doesn't matter. I'm yours. You're the one perfect thing I have and I'll never let you go.'

Fleur's fingers curled into his shirt, then she crushed her lips against his. 'Prove it,' she whispered. 'I want to feel it.'

\'We\'re outside...' His fingers slipped into her hair.

'Someone---\'

\'The Fidelius.' Fleur tugged three buttons of his shirt open, then her eyes darkened several hues and she scorched the rest of their clothes away. \'Nobody can see us.\'

'That's true.' He traced his fingertips up the inside of her thigh and through the hot, silk-soft wetness between her legs, cupping her breast in his other hand and toying with her stiff nipple.

She shivered and pushed herself against him. 'Don't tease me.' A moan slipped from her lips as he curled his fingers into her. 'I want to *feel* it.'

Harry caught the desire burning in her blue eyes and slid his fingers back out of her. His hand crept up into her hair. 'You'll feel it,' he whispered, twisting her around and pinning her against the door.

Fleur gasped and pushed herself back toward him. Wetness shone on the inside of her thighs and the bright pink between them glistened when he spread her open. Harry eased himself into her as slowly as he could manage until her nails scored lines through the flaking white paint and she thrust her hips back at him.

'Don't *tease*,' she whispered, little white feathers sprouting

along her arms.

He curled his fingers in her hair and tugged her head back to kiss her hard, going harder and deeper until the door rattled and her gasps came in time with the slap of his thighs against hers. Fleur pushed herself back into him faster and faster, then came undone with a soft moan and ragged gasps.

Heat pooled in his belly, swirling hotter and hotter. 'Fleur,' he whispered. 'I'm close.'

'I don't care.' She forced herself all the way back. 'I want to

feel it.'

The green-eyed girl in the glass flashed before Harry's eyes

and he burst inside her, holding her tight against him. Fleur staggered back into his arms and clung to him, veiled in a thin film of sweat.

White trickled down her trembling thighs and her breasts heaved as she leant into him, her tangled silver tresses sticking to his chest. A fierce satisfied heat swirled in Harry's chest as she smiled up at him.

'I like it when you pull my hair,' she murmured. 'We need a shower,' Harry said.

'Mmmm.' Fleur's hand crept down his chest and over his stomach. '*Or*... we can cross the bathroom off our list first.'

Harry chuckled. 'Or that.'

# Flowers from the Storm

Agdol's shadow paced the length of the blind in his office and muttered Gobbledegook drifted from the half-open door.

*Someone probably broke his precious rules.* Fleur crossed her ankles. *But not me. Not this time, at least.*

'He's pissed.' Bill leant back in the chair at the edge of her desk. 'All the goblins have been antsy recently. Something\'s going on down below, I reckon. Voldemort's stirred them up.'

Fleur glanced at her enchanted quill and quirked an eyebrow.

'Down below?'

He threw a glance at Agdol's shadow. 'How much do you know about goblins?'

'French history with them.' Fleur watched him drag his chair around beside hers and raised her eyebrows when he got within arm's length. 'Why?'

'So not much.' Bill threw another glance at Agdol. 'Not much less than me, though.' He fiddled with the dragon fang, bouncing it on the ball of his thumb. 'So, from what I've gathered. Gringotts is just, like, a trading outpost. All the branches are.'

'And?'

'Well.' He shrugged and scratched his cheek. 'They're like the tips of the iceberg. Whole bunch of different clans and kingdoms down there. Takes a few years to start to recognise them from the Gobbledegook or the symbols. Some of them have cut off from the surface altogether, I think. Some are happy as things are. But most...'

'Aren't.'

'Yeah.' Bill shifted a little closer and lowered his voice. 'Long memories, goblins. Some of it's in their language, though, if you pay attention. They call the Alps *Ukz Dar Danag*which literally means *peaks of our bones.* And they're opportunistic bastards, goblins, every time some wizarding conflict pops up they get all shifty.

Reckon they'll be thinking about another rebellion more and more the

longer this war goes on.*'*

'But they still live under the Alps.' Fleur threw a glance at the clock as Agdol stomped from his office and out toward the apparition point, his briefcase in hand. 'Half the wars against goblins were fought under the Alps.'

*Agdol's not coming back if he's taken his case.* She pursed her lips. *If I can get rid of Bill, I can go check on the Notts.*

'Yeah, *under* them. They want their land above the surface back.' Bill's gaze dropped to her fingers and a faint frown passed across his face. 'Lost the ring?'

'No.' Fleur slipped out of her seat on the far side and

ushered her quills away. 'It's in the drawer.'

'Not wearing it?' Bill leant back in his chair. 'I thought you

liked it?'

'My boyfriend didn't like it.' Fleur cleared her desk. 'It's an

interesting puzzle, but not all that pretty.'

'Right. Your boyfriend. Of course.' He rolled his eyes. 'If you're done early, we can grab a drink or something. I've had enough of the idiots downstairs for one day. Bunch of dicks thought it'd be funny to trick me into a cursed wardrobe at lunch. It grabbed me *everywhere.* Never felt so violated in my life.' He chuckled, then the

laughter faded from his face. 'Speaking of the war, though. You thought about my offer? I --- well, look, I consider you a friend, even if you *are* French, and those Death Eaters are nasty pieces of work...'

'Non.' Fleur slipped her wand back through her belt. 'To

both.'

Bill sighed. 'Will you at least promise to think about it if

things get worse or let me come by with a friend or two and put up

some wards for you?'

She laughed. 'I would be surprised if your friends can ward

things better than I can.'

'They've had ten years experience warding.' Bill grimaced. 'You're a really stubborn girl, you know. It annoys me almost as much as I like it.'

'Ten years of experience stopping portkeys from working.' Fleur turned her nose up. 'When I left Beauxbatons, I could've joined the French version of your Unspeakables.'

'Shit.' Bill's jaw dropped. 'Guess I should warn my boys you'd do worse than slap them.'

Fleur let her magic darken her eyes a few hues. 'Much worse. And I'm not the one they'll need to worry about.'

*Harry would kill them.* His cold, hard green eyes glowed amongst her thoughts. *He'd kill them all. And so he should. Anything between us and our sunset doesn't deserve mercy.*

'I'm leaving.' She locked her drawer with a tap of her wand. 'I will see you tomorrow, if you feel the need to come and check I've not broken anything or lost any fingers.'

'Right.' Bill slid his chair back to its normal spot. 'See you tomorrow, love.' He strode away.

Fleur shot a dark look after him. *Decent guy you might be, but you're pushing your luck. The last thing I need is Katie Bell seeing you try something and start whispering in Harry's ear. He panicked seeing us just having a conversation.*

She took a deep breath and smothered a little flare of heat.

'It wouldn't help her, anyway. Harry will never choose her over me.'

*Even if he seems to treat her almost the same.* Their embrace spun \'round and \'round before her mind\'s eye. *He has no trouble getting all close with her. I bet he tells her his secrets too. He talks to her about me, after all.*

Fleur closed her eyes and pictured a wild, unkempt field beneath lime trees and a dying pine, apparating into wet grass and scattered poppies. A tangle of dark-leafed, white-flowered rhododendrons screened everything but the chimneys and roof of the house from view.

She disillusioned herself and crept through the sweet- scented bushes to where a low wall ran between the wild grass and neat-trimmed flat lawn. The damp and cold soaked through her shoes and socks into her feet. *That's where I would put a ward, if I was going to put one up.* She stretched her sense of magic out and found the endless abyss of the Unyielding Shield Charm beneath the thin layers of anti-apparition and portkey wards. *Impressive, but with both Harry and I, not a problem. And there's nothing to let anyone inside know someone's broken through the wards, either.*

Three loud cracks rang out across the grass. A trio of figures appeared before the wall a dozen steps along and the FiantoDuri wavered and vanished. Two silver masks shone either side of a blank white one.

'I really don't want to go back there.' The middle figure's silver mask gleamed in the sunlight. 'They've not put any of the wards back up, sure, but the place is still a death trap.'

'There's nobody down there but caretakers, Rookwood.' Nott's dark robes faded away to reveal smart blue ones and he tucked his silver mask away beneath them. 'Grindelwald killed all the *real*Unspeakables. First thing he did when we got involved in the war. Fudge and all the idiots that've run the place since then have refused to spend any money on restarting it.'

'That we *know* of,' Rookwood said. 'Could be a couple down there waiting for me tomorrow. I can't even wait until the evening, because I'm supposed to cause trouble during the lunchtime shift change as a decoy before I leave.'

*Tomorrow lunchtime.Silver mask means inner circle, too.*

She scowled. *I'll have to be working then. Merde.*

The third figure vanished with another loud crack.

'Jugson's pissed.' Nott laughed a rough laugh. 'Don't think he's pleased with the Dark Lord's comeback.'

'He's pissed because the Dark Lord has stuck us out here and said we can\'t talk to anyone.' Rookwood balled his fists and kicked at the grass. 'He wanted to go have some fun with muggles.'

Fleur pursed her lips, apparating back home onto the landing. 'Mon Cœur?' She knocked upon the door to the spare room. 'I know you're brooding in here.'

Harry pulled the door open and smiled at her. Runes of

purple flame hovered in the air behind him. 'You're back early.'

Fleur watched the runes flicker and narrowed her eyes at him. 'Did I interrupt you doing something dangerous that you decided not to tell me about?'

Harry twitched. 'You interrupted me *planning* to do something dangerous I hadn't quite gotten around to telling you everything about.'

Fleur pushed him back into the room with one finger and tossed her hair over her shoulder. 'What is it?' She closed her eyes. A swirling ball of intent surrounded her like the eyewall of a storm; its winds throbbed like a racing heartbeat. 'What does it do?'

'Decreases my recovery time.' Harry swept the runes away with his wand. 'One of the ones in Salazar's book. I've tweaked it a bit today to make sure it works for me.'

Fleur stole his chair and rested her heels on the desk, pulling her shoes off one at a time and setting them on the floor. 'I visited the Nott house just now.'

'Oh?' Harry stepped behind her and massaged her back with

his thumbs. 'Anything interesting?'

'Two things.' Fleur closed her eyes and let out a little sigh as his fingers worked into her muscles. 'One, the wards are strong, but not very smart, so we'll have no trouble getting in. Two, Rookwood, who's not on your list, seems to be in the inner circle and is slipping into the Department of Mysteries tomorrow.'

'I'm not really doing much tomorrow,' Harry murmured. 'I could hang about and wait for Rookwood if the aurors don't catch him first. I don't know anything about him, do you?'

'I know he's going during the shift change for the aurors at lunch and he's one of the ones that got broken out of Azkaban.' Fleur

leant her head back and gave him a warm smile. 'That feels really good. Keep doing that.'

'I guess I can ambush him.' Harry yawned and pressed a kiss to her forehead, running his hands down her back until all the stiffness melted away from her body. 'At the very least, it's one less inner circle member to worry about.'

'And no doubt you're happy I can't come,' she accused. 'A little bit.' Harry shot her a rueful grin. 'I like knowing

you're safe.'

A small pout crept onto her lips. 'Well, I'm going to go take a shower and then play with my new toy.'

'Ah.' A gleam of curiosity sprang up in Harry's eyes. 'Your

box.'

'My box.' Fleur bounced out of her chair and plucked her

shoes off the desk. 'But now, I could really use a warm shower, my feet are cold and wet.'

'You want to cook something, or wait for Gabby?' Harry

called.

'Wait for Gabby.' Fleur poked her head back in through the

door. 'We might decide to go somewhere nice in France.

# A Rook of Wood

The golden statues gleamed in the fountain as Harry slipped through the atrium beneath his cloak and into the elevator beside a slim, lanky wizard with a box of files in his arms. Red-robed hit wizards clustered at the entrances, wands in their hands.

The lanky wizard elbowed one of the buttons.

'Internal Affairs,' the automated voice announced.

Harry studied the inside of the elevator. *Seems like they fixed all the damage.* He stared at the ceiling until the doors pinged and the wizard stumbled out. *Department of Mysteries time.* Harry pushed the button and waited.

'Floor thirteen,' the female voice said.

'Thanks.' Harry slipped out and strode down the corridor toward the ruined entrance. 'I guess they haven't fixed this.' He cast a quick revealing charm, but nothing appeared, so he leant against the wall. 'Time to wait, then.'

He spun his wand in his hand and watched the elevator doors while time trickled by. *One more horcrux. The stone.* Harry closed his eyes and let the sunset hover among his thoughts. *And then we're free.* Blood spread over white tiles before his mind's eye and Dobby\'s faint smile vanished in the flames. *Until we die.* His gut knotted. *Then the emptiness has us forever.*

The elevator pinged.

Five dark-robed figures stepped out. Four white masks surrounded one gleaming silver one.

'Hurry up,' Rookwood snapped. 'We go in. We take anything useful. We get out. Don't touch *anything* unless I say so. If you see a time-turner, let me know. They're our priority.'

*I destroyed all the time-turners.* Harry curled his fingers into the silk of his cloak and raised his wand. *No Fiendfyre down here. It\'ll bring the place down on my head.* He waited as they approached, holding his breath and flattening himself against the wall.

The last white-masked Death Eater stepped past in a wash of wet wool reek.

Harry pulled off the cloak. 'Ardensflagello.'

A wave of purple fire swept from the end of his wand.

A Death Eater disappeared beneath it, writhing and screaming. The fire splashed off Rookwood's shield and guttered out. Harry batted away a handful of orange curses and transfigured the walls into spikes, wrinkling his nose at the stench of seared flesh.

'Confringo.' One of the Death Eaters shattered the spines.

Harry's piercing curses punched through him, spattering them all in steaming gore. Brown spells sailed over his shoulder and scorched small holes into the wall. He deflected a few back at them, slipping his own spells into the mix until they threw up shining, silver shields.

'Fuck this,' Rookwood snarled, turning on his heel and sprinting through the ruined door. 'You two kill him. I'll get what we need.'

Harry poured magic into his spells as the two Death Eaters retreated after Rookwood, hammering curses into their Shield

Charms until their light wavered and failed. The pair threw themselves through the nearest door.

'There's no way out of here.' He stepped after them, sparing a glance for the whispering archway. 'Except past me.'

'What do you want?!' The closest tore off his white mask. 'Whatever you want, just tell us! You can have it!'

Harry slashed his wand forward and stuffed the invisibility cloak under his clothes. The basilisk's maw closed over them, sending shredded corpses splattering across the stone benches like rag dolls, and he sprinted back out after Rookwood's fading footsteps.

Rookwood kicked at the sealed door, saw Harry, then swore and bolted into the Hall of Prophecies.

*Back here again.* Harry stepped in after him.

'You're the sort of wizard who ends up down here, you know.' Rookwood's voice drifted through the shelves of glowing white orbs. 'I came down here, but only to look after the place. You *belong.*'

Harry prowled through the prophecies, breathing in the soft

cool must. 'Come out, come out, wherever you are!'

Rookwood's sneer echoed through the shelves. 'You sound like that mad bitch, Bellatrix. The Dark Lord never favoured me like he did her or the others. I had to earn this silver mask.'

'I killed her.' Harry tracked Rookwood's voice through the gloom. 'I'm going to kill you.'

Derisive laughter drifted through the pale, gleaming spheres. 'No you aren't. I know this place pretty well. This mask I earnt. I earnt it down here. Six long fucking years rotting in the dust for that silver trinket.'

'Then you know there's no way out.' Harry peered through the rows of predictions and spun his wand in his hand, then strode back to the entrance. 'And if you're going to play hide and seek, I'll just wait by the door...'

A shadow flickered in the corner of his eye.

He twisted 'round and batted away a bright orange curse; it smashed through the shelves, leaving a trail of white ghosts and a cacophony of prophecies. Rookwood dived behind a stack of white orbs. Harry hurled piercing hexes through it, sending shards of glass hissing through the air.

White mist swirled over Rookwood and silence hung over the Hall of Prophecies.

*Back to hiding.* Harry retreated toward the door one step at a time, glass fragments crunching beneath his feet.

A faint shimmer darted past his shoulder.

*Merde.* Harry twisted 'round and unleashed a barrage of

spells.

Rookwood's Disillusionment Charm faded and a shining silver

shield weathered the hail of Harry's spells. 'Good luck getting out.'

He reached out and touched a finger to one of the prophecies.

*Double merde.* Harry hurled another pair of spells after Rookwood, scorching the walls of the corridor. His third spell put a fist-sized hole in the elevator door as Rookwood ascended out of

sight. *The aurors will be here in a few seconds. And they'll probably*

*seal the exit off and sweep this place for disillusioned wizards.*

'No point sneaking.' He thrust his wand back into his sleeve and conjured long, dark robes and a plain white mask to conceal himself. Harry closed his eyes and wrenched at the world; his magic scrabbled at thick, strong wards. 'And only one way out.'

The elevator pinged and a group of red-robed wizards charged out behind bright shield charms. Harry grit his teeth and clawed at the ward, crushing it down. Spells flashed past. A ray of blue light seared through his thigh and sent him staggering back against the wall.

The world spun past him and he stumbled across the kitchen floor, spattering blood across the saucepan cupboard. The stinging throb in his leg swelled to a crescendo and he sank down to the floor, poking a finger around the edge of the smoking hole.

'That... did not go well.' He sighed. 'Vulnerasanentur.'

The throb in his thigh faded away.

Harry vanished his conjured robes and mask, then kicked his

jeans off. 'Better not let Fleur see that hole or she'll melt my face off.'

'Better not let me see what, monCœur?' Fleur stepped in from the hall, a copy of the Daily Prophet in her hand. 'Unfortunately for you, I'm on my lunch break...'

'Ah.' Harry shot her a rueful grin. 'So. To sum up. Rookwood got away. Some auror made a hole in my leg. And I had to break the wards to apparate out, so I'm going to feel dead tired when the adrenaline wears off.'

Fleur's lips thinned and her eyes darkened to midnight blue.

'Did you... *improvise?*'

'Nope.' He grinned and repaired the hole in the front, then turned the jeans over and mended the one in the back. 'I didn't even really have a plan to begin with, this time.'

'It went all the way through?' Fleur's eyes flashed black and she swatted him over the head with the newspaper. 'You have no sense of danger!' The newspaper burst into flames, scattering to ashes, and white feathers burst through her skin. 'How do you think I feel?! Waiting, knowing you might do something stupid and reckless enough that you won't come back!'

Guilt twisted beneath his ribs. 'Fleur...'

She dusted ash from her hands and crossed her arms, crumpling white feathers against her stomach. 'How would you like it if I came back with a hole in me?'

He flinched. 'It's not the same.' 'Not for *you*.'

'Not for you!' He hauled his jeans back on. 'I've been hurt before. I'll endure. I'll drag myself back to you even if I'm nothing but a charred corpse!'

'I don't care.' Fleur reached out and caught his chin in her fingers, tilting his head up to hers. 'You don't get to take risks with our sunset, monCœur. Not without talking to me first. If you die, our perfect dream dies, too.'

He swallowed. 'But if we don't kill Voldemort---'

'Some auror put a hole through you.' She closed her eyes and forced the feathers back beneath her skin. 'You think Voldemort won't do worse if you go off to fight him blindly?'

Harry stifled a chill. 'I was trying not to think about fighting him at all.' He shivered. 'I spoke to Salazar about it once. The will behind his magic, the power in his spells, all driven by what he's sacrificed, what he endured.'

'What has he sacrificed?' Fleur swept her hair back over her shoulder. 'What has he endured that you haven't, mon Amour.'

'He's sacrificed *everything.*' 'Why?' Fleur breathed.

A girl in thick-framed glasses strode down a London street in the eye of Harry's mind. 'I don't know\... Perhaps, perhaps after everyone turned on him and there were no more wishes left, there was no perfect girl to save him.'

*When all the dreams are gone, nothing's left.* A little shudder rippled down his spine and his wand turned hot within his sleeve. *There's only power.*

Fleur's eyes softened and faded to sky blue. 'It doesn't matter what his dream is or was,' she whispered. 'He's standing between us and the sunset.'

*She's right. It doesn't matter.* Harry closed his eyes.

A shadow hovered before the dipping crescent of the red sun, the scattered, warped recollection of a handful of dreams. It spread its arms and green light flickered through the storm clouds like lightning.

*Neither can live\...* He smothered the twist of fear. *There's no*

*choice. He dies. Or our dream does.*

# Forget Me Nott

The bronze pieces of the box's lock gleamed in the summer sunshine spilling in through the kitchen window. Fleur waved her wand at them, watching them combine and recombine into a hundred different shapes.

*Pretty, but does it actually work?* She closed her eyes.

Threads of magic writhed in each piece, grasping at each other every time they combined like desperate fingers.

A shadow passed over her face.

Fleur cracked open an eye and traded her wand for a steaming mug of hot chocolate. Harry strolled past the window, trailed by a procession of glass jars and vials.

*That idiot.* She rolled her eyes and let a pout creep onto her lips. *Thinking he can sneak off to the meadows where I won't see him.*

Fleur finished her hot chocolate, tucked her wand into the waist of her dress, and followed his trail through knee-high, dry grass. She ran her fingers through the rustling fronds near the brook and stepped beneath the shade of the elm trees, crunching twigs beneath her bare feet.

Harry stiffened and sighed. 'Curious, were you?' 'I was.'

'You must have been to put aside your box.' A bright gleam

of humour entered his eyes. 'Are you going to tell me what it does?'

'I am going to lock you in it.' Fleur crossed her arms. 'And keep you there.'

'Imprisoned by a sex-craving, part-human bird-witch.' Harry's smile spread into a broad grin. 'Sounds like fun to me.'

Fleur rolled her eyes and laughed. 'You have been listening to Gabby again.'

'She promised she'd make me prince-consort when she becomes veela queen as long as I renounce you as the first wife in my veela harem and swear on my magic I think she's cuter than you.'

A peal of laughter burst from Fleur's lips. 'No she didn't.' 'No.' Harry swept his wand in a vague circle and the vials

spread out to hover in a loose circle around the edges of the grove

before descending to the ground. 'But she did spend a lot of time explaining how disappointed she was her older sister didn't share her boyfriend with all the female members of her family like a real veela would.'

'Ah, she's on the eleventh book again. They start getting a bit weird from there.' Fleur pointed a finger at the glassware. 'What are you up to, mon Amour?'

Harry began to draw runes on the ground around him in incandescent, purple flames. 'The ritual to increase how fast I recover after using magic. I\'ll recover more, so I\'ll be able to last longer in duels. It\'s an obvious advantage to have, one I\'m sure Voldemort has already seized.\'

An interlocking design of seven triangles, all etched in patterns of blazing purple runes, surrounded him; an array of leaves rose from the largest three jars.

\'Myrrh, bloodroot, vervain,\' Harry said. \'At the moment, this ritual would act as no more than a very potent version of some of the recovery potions you can get at St Mungo\'s or in Diagon Alley, so to make it permanent I get to do the fun, sacrificial, blood magic bit.\' He flicked the tip of his wand across his wrist, releasing a thick stream of crimson from the underside of his palm.

Fleur curled her toes and hissed, clenching her jaw and

balling her hands into fists. 'I do *not* like you doing that.'

The blood flowed in an unbroken pattern over the design, spattering the plants in crimson as Harry made his way around the triangles.

Fleur tugged her wand from her waist and stepped to the edge of the set of triangles. \'Vulnerasanentur,\' she murmured.

\'Thanks.' He twirled his wand in his fingers. 'You should

close your eyes now.\'

Fleur squeezed her eyes shut as a bright, purple flash seared at her eyelids, then dragged them open again.

Harry stood at the centre of a web of pulsing purple runes. Every vein stood out from his skin, his jaw clenched so tight his teeth grated and his whole body trembled.

*It's hurting him.* Fleur twisted her feet in the short grass and moss until it tore. *It's really hurting him.*

Harry sagged. \'Not the most pleasant feeling,\' he muttered. 'I imagine having molten lead poured through your veins would feel similar.' He shot her a tired grin. 'Or how showering in this house used to be before you finally fixed the enchantments in the bathroom.'

\'I did a better job of fixing the shower than you did of painting the door,\' Fleur retorted. \'It\'s supposed to be smooth and even.\'

\'It is,\' Harry replied.

\'It is now you\'ve gone and used magic to fix it,\' Fleur teased. \'Before, there were lumps everywhere and more blue on the doorstep than on the door.\'

\'It\'s harder than it looks,\' Harry protested. \'I needed a better brush really.\' He stuck his chin in the air and put his hands on his hips. \'Next time, \'Arry,\' he drawled in a high falsetto. \'I shall paint ze door myself; eet \'az more \'air on eetzan ze brush does.\'

She pouted at him. 'And I shall. You are not an artist, monCœur.'

Harry vanished the remnants of his ritual and shifted his weight from one foot to the other. A bright little gleam welled up in his eyes.

'You're cute when you get excited,' Fleur told him. \'This is the one you designed to resist poisons, isn\'t it?\'

*A clever enchantment.* She watched him draw a perfect, triangular prism about himself in the same glowing purple runes until he was a shadow behind a wall of floating, violet fire.

A handful of bezoars hovered beside white mistletoe berries and a single silver drop rose from among them, floating to the peak of the prism of flame.

Fleur gasped. 'Where did you get that?\'

'The uncursed unicorn blood?\' Harry grinned. 'I had to make a slightly disturbing trade with a shady vampire for it, but it's pretty much the only thing potent enough to purge any malicious substance or curse away.'

\'I know.' Fleur tossed her hair over her shoulder. 'I read your notes on what you wanted it to do, too.'

'Sneak,' he accused. 'You threatened to tell Gabby about our list of rooms if I peaked at your box.'

Fleur laughed. 'I will show you the box, if you let me join.' 'Join?' Harry froze and a shadow flickered through his eyes.

'But---\' he swallowed '---ok.'

*Realised I'll be safer, have you?* She smothered a triumphant smirk. *Little by little, you'll get used to doing everything with me.*

*You'll learn to trust me.*

'You're getting better.' She flashed him a soft smile and ducked through the floating runes. 'Soon I'll have all your secrets, monCœur.'

'Then you'll get bored of me and fly off.'

Fleur rolled her eyes and kissed him on the cheek. 'If your awful bird jokes haven't got rid of me, nothing will.'

Harry studied his design. 'You know, I don't think I have to change anything.' He spun his wand in idle circles on his palm. 'The only real issue is the sacrifice. I've made mine.' The corner of his lips twitched. 'I've sacrificed plenty to get here and it all counts.'

*I've sacrificed plenty, too.* She buried memories of a trio of best friends and all their times together beneath the French sun and the shadows of the Pyrenees. *The more it hurts to get.*

'Does it matter who does the sacrificing?' she asked.

Harry blinked. 'You know, I'm not actually sure it *will* matter

in our case.'

'Our,' she echoed. '*Finally,* mon Amor.'

Half a smile flashed across his face. '*Our* dream. *Our*

sacrifice.'

*Our perfect wish.*

He opened his wrist and drew forth a thin stream of blood,

draping it over the runes and leaving it hanging upon those in the air like a bright red ribbon. \'Your turn,\' he murmured.

Fleur grimaced and slashed her wand across her wrist, murmuring the incantation of the cutting curse. A deep line tore through the soft, pale skin of her arm. Harry dug his heels into the grass and looked away.

A small smile slipped onto Fleur\'s lips as she layered her blood over his own. 'Vulnerasanentur,' she whispered, touching the tip of her wand to his arm.

He twitched and the cut crept closed.

Fleur healed herself. 'What now?'

\'Close your eyes,\' he whispered, taking her hand.

Fear curled cold, sharp nailed fingers into her belly. 'Will it hurt a lot?'

get---'

He squeezed her fingers. 'It will. But... the more it hurts to

'The more satisfying it is to get it,' she murmured, closing

her eyes and leaning back against his chest.

The purple runes glowed, pulsing so bright her eyelids shone red. The metallic tang of blood saturated her tongue and her lungs began to burn like she'd run until puking.

Fleur curled her fingers into fists, clenching her nails into her palm. *That's unpleasant. Really unpleasant.*

The searing sensation in her chest oozed downward, settling as a roiling, hot pool in her stomach. Fleur forced her gorge down, inhaling through her nose, and Harry\'s breathing turned light and fast beside her. A dizziness seized her. She swayed, stumbling and staggering against him until the sickness faded.

*Merde. That wasn\'t fun.* She opened her eyes to fading purple light and wrinkled her nose at the copper taste clinging to her tongue.

\'That wasn\'t so bad,\' Harry muttered. \'I don\'t feel too tired.\'

\'Is it over?\' Fleur turned her nose up. 'I felt a bit sick, but I'm not tired.'

\'It\'s done. Do we have anything strong tasting in the

kitchen?\'

\'Yes.' She ran her tongue over her teeth. 'We have wine.

Very sweet, white wine.'

'Jurançon...' Harry vanished the remnants of the ritual and

slipped his wand away, apparating them back into the kitchen.

The dizziness returned and Fleur swayed, catching herself on the table. Harry sprawled across the floor with a groan.

'I retract what I said,' he muttered into the tiles. \'This one's

just as bad as all the others.\'

'What were the others like?' she asked.

'They hurt a lot, but I didn\'t feel so horribly sick.'

\'Maybe this will help.\' Fleur plucked a wine bottle from the fridge and tugged out the rubber stop. She conjured two glasses, poured a decent measure into each, gulping the closest down and letting the taste of blood fade.

\'That is a very British way to drink wine.' Harry dragged himself off the floor and staggered into a chair. \'Your family would be horrified.\'

Fleur poured herself a second, more modest glass and sipped it. \'Happy now?\'

Harry quaffed his own drink and closed his eyes. He took a deep breath, then reopened his eyes and grinned at her. \'Now I\'m happy. I don't feel like I'm about to throw up or like I've just gone way too far in my impersonation of a vampire.'

\'Good.\' She finished her glass of wine a sip at a time, savouring the sweet, sharp bouquet and its hint of fruit. \'Lying around feeling sick was not the plan for the rest of the day.\'

\'No.\' Harry's expression hardened. \'No, it wasn\'t.\'

\'Do you think it's still a good idea to go?\' Fleur asked. 'You did just lose a fair bit of blood.'

He drummed his fingers on his glass. 'It's not ideal, but I don't think we should waste our chance.' Harry slid his glass aside and placed his hand over hers. 'Do you not feel up to going? I can go alone.\'

Fleur narrowed her eyes and let a little heat creep from her bones. \'No. You're not going alone. You're not doing *anything* alone again.' She stood and tucked the wine bottle back into the fridge. 'I'll apparate us to the edge of the wards, then take them down.'

Harry frowned. 'Did you check Gringotts's records to see who

they know is there?'

Fleur opened her little notebook and flicked through the

pages. 'Just him, his son, and a house elf registered to the family.' 'A house elf,' Harry murmured. 'I'd rather avoid the elf.'

\'Avoiding a house elf within its own residence is all but

impossible.'

His eyes cooled and he drew in a deep breath. 'Then I suppose there's no choice. Shall we go?'

\'This doesn\'t feel like much of a plan.\' Fleur sighed. 'I much prefer having a plan.'

A small smile passed across Harry's lips. 'I don't really like plans, they just cage you in. Nothing ever seems to go to plan, anyway.'

*Planning leads to hoping.* Fleur slid an arm \'round his shoulders and rested her head on his shoulder. *And hoping leads to hurting.*

\'Let\'s go,\' she said, picturing the manse beyond the lawns.

They appeared upon the gentle slope of a Kentish hill underneath a spread of late-blossoming hawthorn and gentle drizzle. The soft smell of wet leaves and loam permeated the air with the sweet scent of rhododendron flowers. Two hedges, a ditch and a low, loose-stoned wall lay between them and the lawn of the Notts\' smart, symmetrical Georgian home.

'The ward is on the wall.' Fleur pulled out her wand. 'They cast the Unyielding Shield Charm, which I can breach, and their anti- apparition wards and portkey wards are up, which I will tweak to prevent anyone leaving.'

'Will they notice?' Harry asked.

Fleur shook her head. 'There's nothing woven into the magic to alert anyone to any changes. They won't know anything's wrong unless they try to leave or they see us.'

'Alright, then.' Harry's wand slid from his sleeve. 'Wait, what about the Floo?'

'Not connected. I checked.' She touched the tip of her wand to the edge of the ward and re-wove the threads of magic preventing apparition and portkey travel. 'Now hush, mon Amour.'

*The best way to break the Unyielding Shield Charm is to force it to stretch infinitely far, instantly.* Fleur forced an inverted version of the Unyielding Shield Charm from her wand in a crackling beam of white light and watched the two wards battle. Magic poured from her into her spell. *It shouldn't take long to exhaust it.*

A shimmer rippled above them in the haze of rain and the resistance to her magic caved.

'Done.' Fleur let the drain wash over her and the ache settled into her limbs. 'But that was tiring, very tiring. I won't be fighting many long duels.'

'Hopefully, we'll catch them by surprise and won't have to fight any.' Harry took her free wrist in his hand and apparated them in front of and then past the window into the downstairs hall in two quiet snaps.

Fleur trailed Harry as he prowled the halls. Her heartbeat pounded in her ears over the soft patter of the rain and her eyes darted toward every shadow and shape. *Why does it have to be so quiet?*

A loud creak came from behind her.

Fleur whirled, unleashing a stunning spell and twisting away from where she stood, then casting three more at the dark figure in the doorway. Her spells spattered across faded tapestries and bright blue beams melted through the wall next to her head, taking some of her hair with it. Harry\'s piercing curse clipped the white-masked wizard's thigh, leaving a gushing groove.

\'Aguamenti,\' he snapped.

Ice cracked and spread across the hall, coating the tapestries and thrusting, in cruel jutting spikes, from the floor, walls and ceiling. The figure sprayed blasting curses at it, but the spines closed around him like the jaws of a trap, impaling his limbs and pinning him down like an olive on a cocktail stick. Blood trickled over the clear spines, congealed, then froze into red frost.

*Jugson*. Fleur disarmed Jugson and snapped his wand, tossing the pieces over her shoulder. *I was useless. Casting stunning spells. And I didn't even hit him.*

them.\'

\'There's a house elf in residence here,\' Harry said. \'Summon

\'The house elf?' Jugson sneered. *\'Why?*\'

\'I don't make the mistake of underestimating magical

creatures just because they're not intimidating.' Harry cocked his head and the ice shivered, the spines twisting deeper into Jugson like screws into a wall and a fresh wave of red trickled down them. '*Summon them*.'

\'Askey,\' Jugson groaned.

A loud crack echoed down the hall and a bald, wrinkled head appeared between them and Jugson.

Harry's wand snapped up. 'Lacero.\'

The head slipped off its neck and the elf collapsed as if the strings had been cut from his marionette. Crimson spurted from the severed stump onto the ice and froze.

*No risking the one perfect thing that came true.* Fleur rested

a hand on Harry's shoulder. *No matter what it takes.*

\'Are there any others here?\' Harry asked.

\'Are you going to kill them too, Potter? The Dark Lord was right about you. We should have listened.\'

Harry traced the slender ebony tip of his wand down Jugson\'s cheek and rested it against the throbbing artery in his neck, staring right into the death eater's eyes. 'One last try\...'

*A shallow old man. No different to shallow little girls.*

\'Go to hell, Potter.' Jugson spat at the floor between Harry's feet where the blood crept across the rugs toward their toes. \'We\'ll all be waiting for you there.\'

Harry's spell punched a fist-sized hole through Jugon's sternum and he turned away. \'Let\'s go,' he murmured, pulling Fleur back from the spreading red puddle.

*He is always the one who does this.* Fleur smothered a sudden flare of heat and the prickle of feathers. *I tell him I'm not a trophy, but all I do is wait for him when things are hard and help when it's easy.*

\'Do you think there will be others?\' she whispered.

\'There's only Nott and his son,\' Harry said. \'I only asked to

provoke him to think about them.\'

They swept past dull, plain tapestries depicting scenes of hunting and many empty rooms until they came to a grander doorway.

\'Nott's in here.\' Harry touched the tip of his wand to the door and it crumbled to dust, pooling and swirling about their feet as they stepped into the hall. 'I don't know where his son is, but we'll deal with that later.'

Elegant, expensive chairs surrounded a mahogany table that stretched from one end of the room to the other beneath an array of crystal chandeliers. A stooped figure sat at the far end of the table by the fire beneath the painting of a blonde woman.

\'Potter,\' Nott hissed. \'How the Dark Lord will honour me when I bring him you.\'

A flurry of bright orange curses arced towards them over the long mahogany table, but Harry flicked them aside from the tip of his wand, sending them to hiss and spatter across the floor. Fleur stepped \'round him, adding her spells to his as they advanced.

A stray curse struck the chandeliers and fragments of crystal rained down between them, cascading in a glittering sprawl across the centre of the room. The mahogany table collapsed into dust when Harry placed the tip of his wand upon it and Fleur, gracefully twirling around him, deflected the volley of curses Nott unleashed back at him, sending him diving across the carpet. Chairs splintered and shattered under stray spells.

Nott turned his wand on her. \'Imperio.'

A light, floating sensation filled her, a low dull ache throbbed at the sight of the blonde woman painted above the hearth, then a surge of bright, hot hate seized her and she turned her wand on Harry.

*Kill him.* The spell hovered on the tip of her tongue, but something caught them each time she opened her mouth. *Not Harry. He's mine.* Her wand tip snapped back to Nott.

Thin, dark ropes snared the Death Eater and dragged him into his chair, binding him tight. Harry summoned a pair of battered chairs from the wreckage and took a seat in front of him.

*You forgot to take his wand, idiot.* Fleur tugged Nott\'s wand from his limp grip and tossed it into the fire behind him.

\'To what do I owe the pleasure?\' Nott drawled.

'The other Death Eater's dead. Askey too.\' Harry caught the Death Eater\'s gaze. \'Nobody's coming to save you.\'

Nott flinched. \'I have nothing to say to you.\'

'You don't have to *say* anything.' Harry leant back on his chair. 'It really makes no difference.'

Nott\'s wife poked her pale face out from behind the tree on her canvas, clamping her hand over her mouth.

\'I was wondering if you knew of any of your fellows being given something to protect by Voldemort. An object that he greatly valued.\'

\'I told you I have nothing to say to you.\' Nott sneered. \'You, descended from such a prestigious bloodline, now consorting with that *creature*.\' His eyes flicked to Fleur. \'It\'s not unattractive, I suppose; it might make an amusing distraction at times, but to openly breed with it is to contaminate centuries of magical blood.\'

A cold, sharp gleam entered Harry's eye. 'You should

choose your next words *very* carefully.'

Fleur raised a finger and forced a bright blue spark into life upon its tip. 'There's more magic in my finger than you possess, shallow little man.' She pressed the finger into his cheek until he clenched his jaw and writhed. 'You don't get to judge us.'

\'Father!\' Footsteps pounded across the floor. 'Stupefy!'

Fleur whirled and batted aside the spell.

A young wizard clutched a short, light wood wand in one shaking hand. She tore it from his hand with a single spell and tossed it away into the corner.

\'He\'s seen us,\' Harry said. 'You know what that means.'

\'No,\' Nott shouted. \'I don\'t know anything about any object, I swear, but not my son, not Theo!\'

\'I thought you didn\'t have anything to say to us,' Harry said. \'I suppose, if you said something useful, Theo could be memory charmed.\'

*No he can't be.* Fleur exchanged a glance with him as Nott babbled. *And it's time I showed you we're just the same.* A small smile curved her lips. *Maybe it'll help you trust that this time your dream's here to stay.*

'Enough,' Harry said. 'You're repeating yourself.'

\'You said you would Memory Charm him,\' Nott croaked.

'*Please.*'

\'I did.\' Harry raised his wand, a cold, hard look in his eyes. Fleur clawed up Emilie and Caroline and all the little

shallow girls with their games and their whispers and their words. *Shallow little people who'd ruin dreams just because it'd make them feel powerful.* The fire bubbled in her bones and the feathers strained beneath her skin. *We have to ruin them first. It's their dreams or ours.*

'Avada kedavra,' she whispered.

A bright, green flash reflected back off the shattered pieces of chandelier and the polished parts of furniture. Theo Nott crumpled like a house of cards.

\'No!\' Nott cried. \'You --- you---\'

\'I lied,' Harry said.

\'Theo,\' Nott whispered, staring at the body of his son. Tears trickled down his grizzled face as he stared up at the painting above the mantle. \'I failed you, Calli.'

*Dead.* A flutter of disquiet flitted through Fleur\'s stomach. She crushed it. *Just another small dream snuffed out. For ours to live, theirs must die. And I didn't make it that way. They did.*

\'He knew nothing,\' Harry said. \'We've wasted our time.\' \'Two less Death Eaters,\' Fleur replied. 'There are others on

the list.'

\'Yes, there are.\' A faint smile curved Harry\'s lips. \'I\'ll take

them all away from him, one after the other. Until it's just him again.\'

He slashed his wand across his chest.

The fire swirled. A flaming serpent\'s maw lunged from the grate, closing around Nott with a snap and a hiss like cold water poured into a hot pan.

'We should raze the place.' Harry took Fleur\'s hand, apparating them both to the edge of the wards. 'Another disappearance won't stand out anymore, but we don't want Dumbledore or someone at the Ministry to figure anything out.'

Fleur nodded. 'No risking our perfect wish, monCœur.'

Harry wrapped an arm around her shoulders and raised his wand. 'It's not easy to cast or control, but if you could manage the Killing Curse\...'

She leant into his embrace and thrust her wand out beside his. 'There are plenty of things I'd like to see destroyed, and you should know I am more than stubborn enough to keep control.'

him.

'Together?' Harry asked, pulling her a little tighter against

\'Together.'

*All the things I hate about this world.* Fleur took a deep

breath and let old thoughts rise up. *Easy, pretty, expensive trinkets and beautiful lies that float beyond our fingertips.*

Red-tipped flames billowed from their wands across the neat lawn. A roiling storm of magic swirled before them, eating into the wards like boiling water through ice. The head and wings of a vast, feathered serpent rose over the house; its coils encircled it, searing the grass and leaves to ash. Little yellow flames sprang up upon scorched branches, licking at the wood, and smoke streamed across the countryside.

'Leave nothing but ash,' Harry murmured.

The fiendfyre serpent spread its wings, rising over the home like a cobra, then plunged down into the house and drew its coils tight. The walls and roof dissolved beneath the flames and the mansion crashed into a pool of red fire. A thick column of smoke poured off it, rising up to blot out the sun.

Fleur forced the fire down, smothering the desire for destruction. The magic ripped the strength from her like a giant's fist, leaving her gasping and trembling in Harry\'s arms. Patches of crimson flame flared back up across the ruins.

'That\'s enough.' Harry flourished his wand and the red flames guttered out into thin patches of yellow fire. 'The rest will burn out naturally.'

'It's a lot easier to cast than end,' Fleur said.

'Hatred's hard to direct.' Harry\'s wand vanished into his sleeve and he wrapped his other arm round her. \'That was incredible control for your first time.'

'What kind of veela would I be if I couldn't manage a fire

spell?'

off?'

He shot her a grin. 'One that's less inclined to melt my face

'It would just be harder to do.' She sighed and let the ache

of exhaustion wash through her. 'I think I'd rather just take a nap,

right now. You can go back to your stone hunting while I sleep.'

\'Are you okay?\' Harry murmured.

\'I\'m tired.' She leant her head on his shoulder and let her eyelids droop. 'Between the Fiendfyre and the wards\...'

\'That\'s not what I meant.' He twisted \'round and cradled her head against his chest. 'You didn't have to do that, you know.'

Fleur watched the flames consume the rest of the ruins. 'Yes

I did.'

'I could've---'

'You *could've.* And next time you start to worry about your

wish slipping away, you might've thought back and remembered I wouldn't do what you did. You might've started to doubt\...' She tilted her head back against his arm and watched the reflection of the fire dance in his eyes. 'But now you can't. It might be hard for you, but I will *make* you trust me. With everything. Without hesitation. Without doubt.'

Something very soft shone in Harry\'s eyes and a small smile spread across his face. \'There's a mirror, one that can show you what you desire most\...\'

\'The Mirror of Erised,\' Fleur let her eyes slide shut and her weight slip into his arms. \'It's famous.\'

\'I've seen it. In the Department of Mysteries.'

She forced her eyes open and held her breath. \'What did you see?\'

*Us. I hope.* She pictured their reflections in the glass, arm in arm. Gabby hovered at the edge of the scene, a mischievous gleam in her eye. *Our perfect wish.*

He apparated them back into their bedroom with a soft snap and laid her down on the bed. Her dress shifted into loose-fitting pyjamas as he pulled the duvet up and sat down beside her.

'Harry?' Fleur suppressed a yawn as the soft, warmth

enveloped her and let her eyes drift shut. 'What did you see?'

'I saw you,\' he whispered, running his fingers through her

hair as sleep drew her down into the dark. \'I saw you.\'

# A Labyrinth of Delusions

A single line of green flame flickered upon the wall. Harry glared at it and scanned the spread of parchment hovering in the centre of the room.

*All this cataloguing and there's no mention of anything remotely like a resurrection stone.* He sent the pages streaming back into a stack beneath the green line. *Not anywhere. Ever.*

'They probably never even told anyone they had it.' He released a long sigh and strode out and downstairs. 'I wouldn't either.'

*It's fine. I have years. I'll find it eventually.*

'Taking a break?\' Fleur arched an eyebrow at him as she ladled sugar into a steaming mug.

'Can you look at my family's Gringotts records?' Harry

asked, settling into a chair by the kitchen table

She nodded and scooped another heaped teaspoon of sugar

in. 'Can and have.'

'Checking out if I can still afford to buy sugar?' He gave the jar a shake. 'I'm sure I filled that up yesterday.'

'You did.' Fleur screwed the lid on and slid it across the side into its usual spot. 'Why can't you look at your *own* records?'

'I didn't want you to be bored at work?' A soft laugh escaped Fleur. 'Yes you do.'

Harry grimaced and the bronze ring shone before the eye of his mind. 'A little bit.' He shot her a small smile. 'Did you see anything about my cloak?'

'No...' Fleur cocked her head and swept her silver hair over her shoulder. 'Actually, it wasn't mentioned at all.'

Harry muttered a few choice words under his breath. 'I bet whoever got the stone and the wand did the same thing.'

She nodded and took a sip of her drink. 'I suspect they passed it down by hand. A lot of families do, especially with goblin- made things, since Gringotts likes to try and repossess them at any chance they get. There's no mention of any goblin-made dagger for eight generations of Gaunts, then suddenly they traded a goblin- made dagger heirloom back to Gringotts in return for waiving interest payments on a loan.'

He ground his teeth. 'So they kept the stone hidden, whichever branch had it, and someone either stole it or was given it, but we've no way of finding out who or when.'

Fleur stepped across the kitchen and put her mug down to take his hands between hers. 'There are other ways of finding things. The only limits magic has are the ones we believe it has. Perhaps we can give scrying a try.'

'Scrying?' Harry asked.

'An obscure form of divination. Gabby knows a bit about it. It requires a similar gift to hers. We might be able to create something similar.'

'I picked the wrong sister,' Harry teased.

'Don't worry, monCœur, in the veela harem, all sisters are equal.' Fleur rolled her eyes. 'Now *I'm* making those jokes.

*Incroyable.*'

Harry chuckled. 'I guess it'll have to wait.'

'Better to focus on the now, I think.' She plucked her drink off the table and took another sip. 'Otherwise, I'll need the stone for you.'

He nodded and folded up a spare piece of parchment,

sliding his wand from his sleeve. 'I made a new spell...'

'So?' Fleur raised her eyebrows at him over the steaming mug. 'I finished my box. If you get the right shape, it unlocks the box, if you don't, the enchantment opens all your synapses and paralyses you.'

Harry threw a glance at the flowing bronze design upon the small box. 'Is this how you plan to stop me stealing your cake?'

She laughed. 'The only thing I've put in it are the vials full of your memories and a few other bits and pieces you've given me.'

'Hoarding things like a magpie, mon Amour?' Harry's heart

flopped about in his chest. 'No shiny rings?'

Fleur gave him a small smile. 'No rings.' She poked him in the shin with her toe. 'Tell me about your spell.'

He tapped the piece of parchment with his wand and watched it crumble to fine dust. 'It's a curse, really, like the withering curse, but faster acting and only effective against inanimate things.' Harry vanished the dust. 'I couldn't get it to overcome the survival instinct of magical living things without it being slow again.'

'Do you have to imbue it?' Fleur asked.

He nodded. 'Yeah, I have to be able to push the magic into whatever I'm targeting, which basically means I need to touch it with my wand.'

'You used it on the table at the Nott mansion,' she said. 'First test.' He grinned. 'It worked well.'

'Don't test new spells at reckless moments,' she scolded. 'What if it had gone wrong?'

A brief twist of guilt tightened in his breast. 'It was fine, wasn't it?'

'*This time.'* She folded her arms, a small pout creeping onto her lips. 'If you keep taking risks, eventually you lose.' Fleur sipped her drink. 'Have you tried imbuing conjurations with your spell?'

'No...' Harry turned it over in his head. 'I could do that, couldn't I? It's basically the same thing, just a bit less direct.'

'Your pretty butterfly spell.' She set the mug down. 'Try

that.'

He conjured a single, ebony-winged insect, suffusing it with

his new spell as it left his wand\'s tip, and directed it across the table to alight upon another piece of parchment. It collapsed into dust and the butterfly vanished in a wisp of black vapour.

\'You\'re brilliant.\' Harry stood up and pressed a light kiss upon her lips.

Fleur clutched the front of his robes and dragged his lips back to hers until his heart raced. 'A brilliant girl deserves a longer kiss, no?'

His hands slipped to her waist, pulling her dress up inch by

inch. 'You can have more than kisses, if you want...' Fleur bit her lip. 'Tempting...'

Hedwig fluttered through the open window with a low hoot and dropped a letter upon the table.

'Your results.' Fleur slipped out of his hands and grabbed the envelope. 'Let's see...'

'Mood-killer.' Harry shot Hedwig a glare. 'I wish the Fidelius still kept you out.'

Hedwig nibbled her foot, turned her head around and stared out the window.

'Not even a hint of guilt.' Harry tutted. 'Shocking.'

Fleur waved the envelope at him and scrunched her face up.

'A shame the Fidelius doesn't keep out spiders or earwigs.'

\'If only you were so lucky,\' Harry teased. \'Sadly, you have no magic powerful enough to keep you safe from such terrifying creatures.\'

\'Just thinking about their creepy little tails and legs makes me shiver.\' She drew her slim shoulders together with a little shudder. 'They're horrible.'

\'It\'s a good thing nobody else knows about this Achilles heel.\' Harry laughed. \'If I can conjure butterflies, I\'m sure I can manage earwigs too.\'

She offered him a sweet smile. \'If you summon so much as a single one of those ugly creatures, you'll find kisses will be *all* you get for a very long time.\'

Harry chuckled. \'It might be worth the screams.'

\'Oh?\' Fleur\'s smile turned sultry. 'Tu es sûr de ça?'

'I'm fairly sure your inherent sexual veela nature will bring

you crawling back to me, bird-girl,' he teased.

'Crawling?' Fleur huffed. 'Never. I might let you make me ask, but I will *never* crawl.' A wicked, wild gleam welled up in her blue eyes. 'There are *far* more fun things I can do on my knees...'

'Promises, promises.' Harry tugged the envelope from her fingers. 'Don't you want to know if you beat me first?'

'I don't want to know *if* I have beaten you.\' She smirked and pressed her lips to his cheek. \'I want to know by *how much*.\'

\'What did you get?\' Harry asked. 'Perfect Os?' 'As always.\'

\'Right.\' Harry slid a finger through the envelope and pulled out the slip of paper within. 'So in other words the best I can hope for is a draw.'

\'Can I see?\' Fleur turned her wide, soft, blue eyes on him.

His heart squirmed in his breast and a smile spread over his

lips. 'Cheating bird-witch, you're using your unnatural wiles, again.'

She plucked the letter from his hand. 'My wiles are au naturel.' Her eyes dipped to the letter and her playful smirk widened. 'There are a few letters in here that aren\'t Os. What do they mean?\'

Harry laughed. \'You know full well what that means.'

\'You mean that you didn\'t get the highest grade in four subjects. Well, I suppose I can help you.\'

\'What challenging things are we ever going to need to undertake involving Astronomy, or History of Magic?\' Harry asked. \'Unless you\'ve been planning a goblin rebellion while you\'ve been at Gringotts?\'

Fleur's smile faded a fraction. 'It's more than likely the goblins are planning their own rebellion. The stronger Voldemort gets, the more old followers of Grindelwald start to dream they've a new champion. The goblins will revolt the moment they think they have a chance.'

A soft thrum echoed through the house.

\'Someone's here,\' Harry said.

\'Sirius, unless they're *very* good with wards.\' Fleur's wand appeared in her hand. 'Gabby's not meant to be visiting for a while now. Just in case.'

Harry slipped his wand from his sleeve and strode to the door. Sirius waited on the step, staring up at the sky.

*Just Sirius.* He tucked his wand away. *I wonder if something*

*important's happened?*

'Only me.\' Shadows lingered under Sirius's eyes, deep and

dark.

*Little Nym.* Harry smothered the brief recollection of warmth

beneath the image of her still face and empty eyes. *She might've been another friend like Katie, but Voldemort took her away.* His heart slipped down into the dark. *He'll take everything away if he can. Until all the wishes are gone and all our dreams are dust.* A twist

of pity seized him, then dwindled into the void. *Because all his*

*dreams turned to dust and now he doesn't believe in them at all.*

'Come in.' Harry ushered Sirius into the house and shut the

door. 'Has anything happened?'

\'Dumbledore's back.\' Sirius trudged into the lounge and slumped into the chair across from the sofa. He gave Fleur the faintest shadow of a smile and a wave. 'He just popped in like nothing's changed since the summer began, then popped out again.'

Harry took a seat beside Fleur on the sofa and slipped an

arm 'round her. \'Did he say what he's been doing?\'

'Something crucial was all he said.' Sirius clenched his fists and jaw. 'He outlived my parents' generation, he's nearly outlived mine, and now he's started outliving *yours*.'

Fleur leant forward. 'He prefers to let people die nobly than dirty his own hands. His own conscience is more important to him than ensuring we win.'

Sirius glowered at the carpet between his feet. 'You're damn right it is. He had to be dragged out of Hogwarts to fight Grindelwald according to my mother. If he'd gone a year or so earlier, there'd be a lot more people still alive. Same with the war against Voldemort before you were born. He just talked and planned and waited until suddenly there was you, Harry.'

'Imagine what would've happened if Harry hadn't been there,' Fleur murmured. 'Imagine if Harry was just another student...'

Sirius snorted. 'Until recently, I thought he was.' He shot a long look at Harry. 'I don't know whether I should be proud of you\... or sad and angry with everyone else that they let it come to this.'

'Probably all three,' Harry replied.

'Each time one of us disappears, they all repeat Dumbledore's words to themselves and go back to doing nothing.' Sirius shook his head. 'They're waiting for you to be a hero, hoping you die for them, before they die doing nothing.'

Fleur's eyes flashed pitch black. 'They're not getting their hero!' Little white feathers sprouted from her skin and heat washed across the room. 'Little, shallow, hollow, selfish creatures! They could fight back themselves and stop this, but they'd rather watch Harry die than do anything! They don't *deserve* a hero!'

Sirius sagged. 'Dumbledore's spent years talking about love, and sacrifice, and heroes. It's sunk too deep. I tried. I *tried.* But they're all convinced of it. Harry is their hero. They just have to survive until he saves them.'

*Until I die. Heroes die.* A faint pang echoed beneath Harry's

ribs. *And they die alone.*

'And let me guess,' Fleur hissed. 'Every time someone dies or disappears, it's *Harry* they blame, for not throwing his life away for them quick enough.' Her skin burnt beneath Harry's arm and the white tufts stretched into full feathers. 'I bet they hate him. And even when he wins, they'll only envy that he's better than them and hate him more.'

*They preferred their jack-in-the-box hero.* Harry let his heart sink down into a numb, dark place. *Was it really so bad that I didn't want to die alone?*

Fleur's hot fingers curled 'round his wrist and her ink-black irises bored into him. 'Don't waste thought on them. They put you on a pedestal so you'd save them, then delighted in tearing you down from it when they thought they didn't need you. Now they want you

to throw away your life to save them. You have never owed *any* of them *anything*, monCœur.' She cupped his chin and pressed her forehead to his until the world shrank to just the dark of her eyes. 'Don't waste time worrying about their web of selfish little wants. To reach our sunset, we'll *cut right through it.*'

Sirius cleared his throat. 'They're just people. People being people. They do some terrible things and some great things. It takes a bit of time to understand that, I certainly didn't at your age.' He sighed. 'I wish Moony was still around. He's a serious, miserable bastard nowadays, but other than little Nym, he was the only person that talked to me. Everyone else's gone.'

'Who's left?' Harry asked. 'What don't I know?'

Sirius shrugged. 'Shacklebolt's gone. Disappeared in Yorkshire helping hit wizards in one of the Ministry's *victories.* Little Nym, of course, and Mundungus, and Arthur. Emmeline Vance vanished a week back.\' He fell quiet. \'Haven\'t heard from Moony in a while, either, not since Dumbledore suggested it might be a good idea to offer werewolves an alternative narrative to Fenrir Greyback's.\'

*Lupin.* Harry caught Fleur's glance in the corner of his eye and gave her a slight shake of the head. *If he really cared about me, he wouldn't have vanished for two years without so much as a letter.*

'What about everyone else?' Harry asked.

'The Ministry's lost half its hit wizards and there's only a dozen or so real aurors left.' Sirius tugged his wand out and toyed with it on his lap. 'Voldemort's drawing more and more support from Europe.

He's no Grindelwald, but the more desperate or hateful don't really

care at this point. If it keeps going, we'll lose.'

'I guess you'll need your hero,' Harry murmured.

Fleur's nails bit into his wrist and her fingers tightened until his hand turned numb and tingled. 'They don't deserve one.'

'It's the inner circle of Death Eaters that are the problem.' Sirius pointed his wand at Harry. 'They're all decent in a fight and they know a lot of fairly obscure or nasty spells. Hit wizards are trained to catch smugglers and be able to deflect common curses. Someone like Dolohov or the Lestranges can tear right through them.'

'Is there any kind of plan?' Harry asked.

'Dumbledore has one.' Sirius sneered. 'It seems to boil down to arranging a string of dominoes leading to you sacrificing your life and killing Voldemort. The Ministry's abandoned its war of attrition and fortified Azkaban. Amelia Bones sends her squads out from there to crush any raids they learn of and brings anyone they capture straight back to the Dementors. Beyond that, I think the Ministry is buying time to train everyone they can and hope those who oppose Grindelwald come to fight his remaining followers even though they're now beneath Voldemort's banner.'

A soft chill slid down Harry's spine. 'Has Dumbledore been looking for us?'

'He asked me if I know any secrets,' Sirius said. 'So I think he must've been and has realised why he can't find you.' His expression darkened. 'Harry... I don't know what he plans for you, but I doubt it ends any better for you than it has for any of my friends or family.

Don't go back.' Sirius stabbed his wand out the window. 'Leave this damn country. Take Fleur and go. She's right. You don't owe anyone here anything.'

'Voldemort and Dumbledore will only come after me.' A grim certainty settled on Harry. 'And if I run away, Voldemort will just be even more powerful when he catches us.'

Sirius sighed. 'So be it.'

Harry nodded. 'I'm sorry, Sirius.'

'Don't be. It's not your fault.' Sirius tucked his wand away. 'I would say don't go back to Hogwarts, but something tells me you're going to, so at least make sure nobody can find you anywhere else.'

'I need my NEWTs.' Harry offered Sirius a faint smile. 'Someone told me that if all I do with my life is try and survive Voldemort and Dumbledore, I'll be as lost in victory as in defeat.'

Fleur's grip on Harry's wrist loosened and a fierce tingling seized his hand. 'Sorry,' she murmured as he massaged some life back into it.

'I'd stay out of London.' Sirius's expression turned grave. 'The Ministry's finally thrown up a load of wards over Diagon Alley and its headquarters, so no Death Eaters can get in, but that means Dumbledore can easily keep eyes on it at all times.' He stood up and stretched. 'I'd better head back before anyone notices I've slipped away.'

A loud crack echoed through the room and Sirius vanished.

Harry shared a long look with Fleur. *Please don't be*

*stubborn about this.*

A small smile crossed her lips. \'I'll terminate my contract with Gringotts. The goblins are getting shifty, the curse-breakers are annoying, and I don't need to be there anymore. We've learnt all we probably can from their records.'

A little sigh escaped him.

'Were you expecting me to argue?' she teased.

'I generally assume you're going to be difficult about everything,' Harry replied. 'I'm sorry you'll have to give up your lunch time dates with that curse-breaker.'

'Such a shame.' Fleur's tone shifted dry as dust. 'I'll miss him terribly.'

'Does he buy you cake?' The lightness he'd intended didn't

quite make it off his tongue.

'Harry...' Fleur's tone sharpened a fraction. He winced. 'Sorry. I was being unfair.'

'You were.' She twisted 'round and dropped her head into his lap. 'But can you tell me one single thing I've not done for our dream?'

Harry swallowed, a flash of green and Theo Nott's crumpling body flitting before his mind\'s eye. 'No.'

'Exactement.' She wriggled about and swept her hair aside. 'They left you with scars, monCœur, but all the bits that were cut away are a perfect match for me.'

A hot swell of emotion tightened into a knot beneath Harry's ribs and his eyes prickled with tears. 'The only perfect thing *is* you,' he whispered. 'I'd think this was all a dream, but I couldn't dream up something half as perfect as you.'

*There's nothing but you.* He bit those words off before they slipped out. *And without you there'll only be nothing, forever, win or lose.*

Fleur pulled his arms around her and closed her eyes. 'Just hold me,' she whispered. 'I'd like to pretend it's still last summer for a

while. Like we still have a little time left with nothing to think about

but us.'

# Something Borrowed

Towering piles of paper rose from the top of Fleur\'s desk, looming over the stacks of crates and their odd assortment of worn trinkets. Agdol paced in his office, muttering in Gobbledegook and clutching at his briefcase clips.

*I will not miss this stifling, boring place.*

Fleur waved her wand and the floating quills drifted back into their box. She plucked it off the desk, weighing it upon her palm. 'No point wasting them on someone else. I made them.' Fleur shrank the box down and pocketed it.

Agdol\'s office door banged open and he stomped across. 'There is no legal recourse left to me that can prevent your departure, but I implore you to remain, Miss Delacour. Gringotts is the safest place in this country and you have all the skills to be very successful with us.'

She met Agdol\'s dark eyes. 'I am *too* skilled to be here. We

both know it.'

'Yes.' Agdol\'s mouth twisted into a snarl. 'My superiors refused to let me even offer you a role worthy of your skill. They are *irzkelberuk,* tied to grudges, and would not accept a human among the roles traditionally held by our people.'

Fleur let her expression soften. 'I appreciate your effort on my behalf, Agdol.' She pulled open the drawer of her desk and passed him her contract. The little box with the ring, she tucked into her pocket. 'I must leave.'

Agdol shook his head. 'It was for *Gringotts*, not for you. You are as skilled as any goblin in your own way, but foolish pride has cost us before, will cost us now, and will no doubt again in the future.' He muttered a few harsh words in Gobbledegook. 'You have been an exemplary, if unorthodox, employee and I wish you well in your future endeavours, Miss Delacour. I hope we do not find ourselves on opposing sides in the future.'

*If we do, you will lose.* Fleur slid the drawer of her desk

shut.

'Thank you,' she said. 'I've left everything ready for my

replacement.'

Agdol ground out a few more curses in Gobbledegook. 'I have no doubt we will miss you all the more when confronted with their incompetence.' He shook his head. 'I have informed the curse- breakers of your departure, so there is no need to trouble yourself with their attentions.'

'Au revoir, then.' Fleur waited until Agdol had closed the door to his office, then retrieved her notebook and tucked that away, too.

*And now\...* She checked the clock. *I have time to buy cake while I linger for Harry.*

Fleur hurried to the apparition point, avoiding catching the eyes of anyone else, and stepped from the bank into the summer sunshine.

Folded blue umbrellas rose on one side of the thin crowd hustling back and forth over the cobbles. Red umbrellas shielded a scatter of sparsely populated tables from the sun on the other.

Fleur caught Katie Bell\'sgaze.

*Merde.* She strode toward her café and chose a table in the sun beside the street. *I will not run away from this girl, but I hope she\'s not so petty as to spit in my drink.*

Katie Bell bounced across, trailed by a floating note-pad and a red-feathered quill. 'Cake?' A broad grin spread across her face. 'We have a lot of cake\...'

*Smiling at me doesn't fool me.* Fleur eyed the fluttering red feather, smothering a faint prickle of heat beneath her skin. *I know what it looks like when shallow little girls try to hide hate behind smiles. If it wouldn't hurt Harry, you'd curse me the moment I turned my back.*

'Anything sweet and light will do.' She pointed at the folded blue umbrellas across the street. 'My usual spot seems to be shut.'

Katie's expression darkened a touch. 'It's going to stay shut.

The hit-wizards arrested the whole family yesterday. Voldemort

sympathisers or informants or something like that.' 'They made their choice,' Fleur replied.

'They were just scared. Voldemort's winning.'

'Voldemort's winning because people aren't fighting.' Fleur suppressed another trickle of heat in her bones. 'They just sit there and wait to be saved. They're useless.'

'Harry will save them,' Katie murmured. 'He saved me.' 'He's not here to sacrifice his dreams to save everyone else.

Harry has his *own* dreams.' Fleur balled her fists and forced the

prickle of feathers down. 'There are *far* too many people who think it's okay to expect Harry to sacrifice his dreams so they can easily have theirs. And then when he's saved them, they don't even say

thank you. They hate him, because they don't like the shadow he casts from the pedestal *they* put him on.'

'I said thank you.' Katie squirmed. 'And I don't care that he's famous or powerful or anything like that.'

*You wanted to say more than thank you, I bet.* Fleur bit her

tongue.

she said.

'Harry appreciates the very few people who feel that way,'

A sharp glint appeared in Katie's brown eyes and she

grinned. 'I'm his best friend, he better appreciate me.' She pursed her lips and wrinkled her brow. 'Let me go get your cake, before I forget, Fleur!' Katie bounced away.

Fleur sighed under her breath. *You're just waiting, aren't you? One misstep from me. One mistake. And you'll defend me the whole time, too, I bet, just so Harry never suspects you wanted me to fail.*

'Fleur!' Bill diverted from the street through the tables, toying with the dragon fang dangling from his ear. 'Bit early for your usual lunch break, isn't it?'

Her heart sank. *And here we go, as if on cue.*

He dragged the chair beside her out from the table, turned it about, and leant over the back of it toward her. 'Agdol gave you some time off?'

'I've quit.' Fleur glimpsed Katie approaching in the corner of her eye. 'No reason to stay.'

Bill's shoulders slumped. 'Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm glad you have.' He shot her a sharp grin. 'And not just because I'm fairly sure you could take my job. Things are getting worse here, you'll be much safer back in France---\'

'I'm not going back to France.'

Katie slipped the plate of cake on the table and rested her

hand on Fleur's shoulder. 'Does your *friend* want anything, Fleur?'

Fleur glanced up into a hostile stare. 'I'm not paying for him.' Bill laughed. 'Fair enough.' He held up his hands. 'I'm fine,

thanks, love. Got a full lunch with the family a little later. They're out

shopping \'round Diagon Alley at the moment.'

A little weight came down on Fleur's shoulder, then Katie's

fingers vanished and she bustled off.

*How dare she?* Fleur grappled with the heat within, thrusting her arms under the table as the feather tips slid out of her skin and turning away to hide her eyes. *I have made no mistakes. I've done everything and more for Harry. She's the one that betrayed him at that ball!*

The smile slid off Bill\'s face and he lowered his voice. 'Fleur, what are you *thinking?*' His knuckles turned white \'round the top of the chair. 'If those Death Eaters catch you...' He swallowed and shook his head. 'You can't stay here, *especially* not now you've no reason to.'

'My boyfriend is here.' Fleur held her breath until her temper faded and turned back to the table, picking up her fork. 'And I'm not leaving him.'

Bill frowned and clenched his jaw. 'You never said what your boyfriend does?'

'He kills dark wizards.' Fleur hid a smile behind a fork of

chocolate icing.

*And if he sees us together again...* The humour drained away and the sweet taste on her tongue turned to ash. *Harry's going to panic. All my work to build his trust up will be ruined.*

'An auror.' Bill's forehead creased. 'Is he any good?' 'Like he's been doing it since birth,' she murmured.

Bill sighed and fiddled with the dragon fang earring. 'Look. I know you probably get a lot of guys causing trouble for you, so I'm not offended or anything, but you don't need to lie to me. I know all about all the aurors here. I'm friends with some of them. None of them have a French girlfriend and they all would've said something about someone like you.' He offered her a weak grin and leant a little closer. 'Be fair, yeah, love? Give me a chance. You have to give *someone* a chance. If I'm not good enough, so be it, but if you never give anyone a chance, you'll never find anyone, right guy or not.'

She stabbed her fork into her cake, taking a long deep breath as heat boiled up from her bones. Katie's eyes bored into her from near the door into the café, then flicked away to the right, her expression twisting into a grimace.

Fleur followed her gaze to where Harry strolled down the street toward the café and her heart plummeted in her breast. *Oh merde.*

His eyes flicked back and forth between her and Bill and his posture tensed.

*Bracing yourself for the worst.* A scream of frustration perched itself at the back of Fleur's throat and she tugged her fork out of her cake, clenching her fingers around it until they turned white. *And I've done nothing. This is all Bill, he just won't leave me alone.Well, you reap what you sow, Bill.*

She twisted \'round and set her fork down with a loud click.

'I'm---'

'Fleur!' Harry drifted across, a faint shadow hanging in his

eyes above the bright smile that turned her stomach. 'How's the cake?'

Bill's head snapped around. 'Harry Potter?' He folded his arms on the back of the chair and relaxed over the top of it. 'You two know each other?'

\'Of course.\' Harry took the chair opposite them. \'Fleur was my competition in the tournament. It was an unforgettable experience. My dragon was really rather unfriendly.\'

*Ah. I see, monCœur.* Fleur bit her lip. *You want to see what I do. A chance for me to prove your fear wrong.* She caught the little flash of ice in Harry's eyes as they flicked to Bill and back to her. *And you want to hurt him, too. For trying to take away your one perfect wish.*

\'You should try curse-breaking.\' Bill grinned and swept his long hair back. 'Some of the spells I\'ve had to take apart make getting eaten by a dragon look blissful by comparison.\'

Harry's eyes cooled a fraction further and his smile

brightened. \'So what brings you to Diagon Alley?\'

\'Fleur is being mysterious,\' Bill said. \'She won\'t tell me what she\'s doing.\'

\'I\'m sorry, I meant *you*, Bill.' A flicker of satisfaction passed through his green eyes. 'I know why Fleur\'s here.'

\'You do?\' Bill looked like he\'d swallowed something particularly sour. \'Well, I came with my family. You know how it is Harry, all that pre-school year shopping. You should probably carry on with yours before all the good stuff vanishes.'

\'I did all mine a while back. I\'ve had all summer to wander around Diagon Alley.\'I must have spent half the holidays here.\'

Bill\'s face tightened. \'I\'m glad you\'ve been enjoying your summer, Harry. I wish mine had been so easy, but the war against Voldemort is harrowing. Still, that's something for us adults to worry about, not you kids.\'

*Does Harry want me to take his side? Or is he just setting Bill up to tear him down?* Fleur sought for any hint in his expression, but that awful bright smile obscured everything but the sharp ice buried in his green eyes. In the corner of her eye, Fleur glimpsed Katie Bell watching the three of them like a hawk. *And she's just waiting for me to make a mistake.*

\'Having to fight Voldemort is a terrible burden,\' Harry said. \'A good thing you adults make sure kids like me never have to carry that burden, right?'

Bill rubbed at the short, ginger stubble on his chin and threw a nervous glance over his shoulder. \'Ah, here\'s everyone.\'

Fleur glimpsed a large group of redheads approaching the

café.

*Fantastique. There are more of them.*

Harry's face hardened.

\'I should introduce you, Fleur.\' Bill waved the whole group

over. 'In case you do take up my offer to come stay with us.' Harry's eyebrows rose a fraction.

*Merde.* Fleur winced. *I didn't tell him about that, did I?*

\'Mum, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, Ron and Ginny,\' Bill gestured to each of his relatives in turn, throwing them all a long, pointed look. \'This is the prodigious French curse-breaker I've been talking about, Fleur Delacour.'

Harry folded his arms and met Fleur's gaze, an unreadable little gleam hovering in his eyes. She could feel his trust wavering behind that shining smile, like a candle flame left out beneath midnight rain.

*Enough of this.* Fleur tugged her chair \'round the table and pulled Harry's hand into her lap. *I am not like the other wishes, monCœur. I am not going anywhere.*

\'I\'m Harry\'s girlfriend,\' she announced.

Bill stiffened and turned to glare at Harry. Harry shot him a beatific grin, more than a hint of satisfaction glinting in his eyes.

\'It\'s nice to meet you.' A faint frown creased Ron's brow.

\'Indeed,\' Percy replied.

\'A pleasure,\' the identical twins murmured.

'Lovely to meet you, dear. How have you been, Harry?' Their mother stared at Harry as if expecting him to wilt beneath the weight of her condemnation. 'We were all very worried.'

'I'm very well, thank you.' Harry slid the arm in Fleur's lap around her waist and pulled her close, pressing a light kiss to her cheek. 'By far the best summer I've ever had.'

\'Congratulations,\' Ginny whispered, staring daggers at Fleur.

*Another one.* Fleur held her gaze and the girl dropped her eyes to the floor. *At least this one's given up.* She threw a look across to where Katie leant on a table, watching them with narrowed eyes. *Unlike that one.*

'Come on, William,' Bill's mother said. 'We need to finish up

here and get home. That ham won't glaze itself.'

The Weasley family drew a little further back down the

street.

Bill groaned, stretched and rose out of his chair. 'Well, Fleur,

my offer still stands. You're welcome to come stay with us where it's

safe. *I* wouldn't want you dragged into anything dangerous.'

Fleur didn't smother the heat; she let the feathers burst through her skin and her eyes flash dark. 'Go *away*. You've caused me enough trouble with your *offer*. I am *never* going to accept it. I am far safer and happier where I am.'

Bill clenched his jaw and bounced the dragon fang on the ball of his thumb. 'Fine. Clearly I'm not your type, you're into little kids. If you two want to mess about in these dangerous times, you can face the consequences by yourselves.' He stomped away through the tables.

\'So that\'s the selfish attachment Dumbledore said Harry was harbouring,\' Mrs Weasley exclaimed. \'Everyone else is fighting, or worrying about him, and he\'s run off to mess around with some air-headed, pretentious French veela.\'

Harry tensed and rose from his seat.

Fleur caught his arm and pulled him back down. \'I don\'t care what the little people think about me,' she murmured in his ear. 'I want to enjoy being here with you before you have to go back to Hogwarts.\'

*These are the last moments of our summer.* A soft ache crept in beneath her ribs and the feathers slid back beneath her skin. *I'll barely see him once he's left.*

'You never mentioned he offered you to come and live with him.' Harry settled back into his chair, but his posture remained tense.

She sighed and ooched her chair across until she was as

close to him as she could be. 'I refused. He wanted me to be safe.'

'With an ulterior motive,' Harry muttered. A dark, cold gleam welled up in his eyes. 'He's lucky I didn't tear him apart.'

Fleur leant her head on his shoulder. 'I would've killed him myself before I let him come between us, monCœur. All those easy little things are worth nothing compared to you.' She cupped his cheek in her hand and turned his face towards hers. 'I wanted something beautiful so much when I was a little younger, but the more I saw of people, the more I realised it was impossible. I gave up on it. And then you came. Out of nowhere, everything I'd once wanted so badly.'

Harry's eyes softened and he bent forward and kissed her.

'Am I getting better?' he whispered. 'I'm trying to be better at it. I just

--- when I saw him... And now everyone knows about you, they'll *all*

try to take you away.'

She rested her forehead against his. 'A bit better, I think. It's

ok, mon Amour, I understand. And if you weren't like you are, you

wouldn't be perfect for me.' Fleur dug a hand into her pocket and fished out the box with the ring in it. 'Here. For you.'

Harry pushed the lid open with one finger. 'I don't like this

ring.'

'Then destroy it.' Fleur picked it up and held it in the air

before them. 'That image of me you saw, of me leaving. That's *never*

going to happen.'

Katie froze on her way toward them through the tables and the colour drained from her face.

*This isn't that sort of ring.* Fleur smirked and slid it onto her left ring finger. *But for daring to hope to steal him, you can panic for a moment.*

'It was here, right?' she asked, wiggling her fingers at him.

'Yes.' His eyes didn't leave the gleaming band of bronze.

Shadows welled up in their green, so deep and dark everything else seemed to drown beneath them.

'So take it off.'

*You're not helplessly waiting for your wish to be stolen, monCœur.* Fleur held her breath. *We're in control. We'll make our wish come true.*

Harry reached out and slid the ring from her finger. He held it in his cupped palm and stared at it as if all the secrets in the world were held within the metal.

'Now do whatever you want with it,' Fleur whispered. 'And, when you're done with it, we can go back home and you can do whatever you want with *me*.'

Harry took his hand away and left the ring hovering in the air. The tip of his wand slipped from his sleeve and a thin tendril of red flame snaked through the ring. Drops of molten bronze spattered down onto the cobbles, then he turned to her with eyes hot with desire. 'Whatever I want?'

A little thrill swept through Fleur, stealing her breath and settling as a soft twist of heat between her thighs. 'Whatever you want,' she murmured in his ear. 'Anything you want to try. However you want to have me.'

He caught her fingers in his, then the world whirled away and she found herself in their bedroom.

*You forgot to say goodbye to Katie, monCœur*. The soft twist of heat between her legs tightened and a flare of triumph rose in her breast. *I made you forget about her.*

Harry's fingers drifted across her cheek and his thumb traced the corner of her mouth. Fleur parted her lips and let him slip his thumb onto her tongue.

'Take it off,' he said.

She held his gaze, then pushed the straps of her dress off either shoulder and let it slide to the floor.

Harry's eyes swept down, then flicked back up. 'All of it.'

Fleur's breath caught and her stomach fluttered above the heat in her belly. She unclipped her bra and let it tumble away, then slid her underwear down her thighs and let it drop around her ankles. Cool air brushed her nipples and whispered between her legs as he admired her. Harry slipped his thumb out of her mouth and ran his fingers through her hair, pressing gently on her head.

She caught his eye as he ran his hand through her hair once more, then slid to her knees, tugging open the front of his trousers. He sprang out, hot and hard in her hand. Fleur traced her fingertips along the length of him, then took his head into her mouth, sucking lightly and running her tongue's tip over him.

A soft groan slipped from Harry's lips and his hands slid into her hair. The thrill shot through her, tightening the coil of heat in her stomach. Fleur took him deeper, sliding his tip over her tongue until it rested against the back of her throat. A quiet hiss escaped Harry and his fingers curled in her hair. She drew back, then took him deep again, revelling in his little groans and gasps until her wetness trickled down her thighs.

Harry twitched against the back of her throat and she pulled back, resting his hardness against her cheek. The scent of his arousal filled her nose and the need between her legs coiled tighter. 'Was this how you wanted me, monCœur?' He twitched against her cheek and she smiled, touching her fingertip to his tip and sucking it clean. 'Would you like me to swallow or do you want to see me wearing it on my face?'

He released a shuddering breath, his pupils wide and dark. 'I don't want you to do anything you don't want to do.'

*So there're things you're afraid to ask of me.* Fleur took him back into her mouth, to the back of her throat, then forced him down until she'd managed all of him. *I'll show you there's nothing I'll balk at.*

She let him slip from her lips as she rose to her feet and stepped back onto their bed, leaning back and opening her legs. 'Come here, monCœur. There's nothing I won't do. I'm *yours.*'

Harry stepped between her knees. His tip brushed through the wetness gleaming on her thighs. Fleur eased herself onto him, then

drew back and took a hold of him in her hand, spreading her wetness over him. She drew him forward, running the head of him in circles over her clit until her legs trembled and the pleasure clenched tight as a fist in her belly, then she slipped him down past her wetness and pressed him against the tight ring of muscle beneath.

Harry twitched in her hand. 'Fleur?'

She opened her thighs a little further apart and held his eyes. 'I said *whatever.* Now you'll know you can do *anything.*' Her heart raced in her breast as the desire smouldered in Harry's eyes, but he remained still against her. 'I don't mind if it hurts,' she whispered.

*I like it to hurt a little bit.*

He pressed against her until she could feel the throb of his heartbeat against her. Fleur clenched her jaw as Harry eased himself into her, forcing her open. A moan tore from her throat as his head slipped into her, then he began to move, pushing deeper and deeper into her, stretching her further and further. Each thrust left a burn surrounding his hot hardness and the heat knotted tight between her legs, rippling through her in searing tremors that left her legs shaking. Little gasps and moans tore from her lips as Harry drove faster and harder into her.

'More,' she gasped.

His thumb traced her lower lip and she opened her mouth to suck on it as the soreness peaked. His fingers drew light circles across her wetness, then curled into her, and the coil of heat between her thighs burst, exploding so hard she saw stars.

Harry's lips pressed against hers as her legs shook and her breath returned. Warmth spilt from within the throbbing ache and trickled down onto the sheets.

Fleur let the soft burn wash through her and smiled as Harry cradled her against him. 'Now you've had me in every way,' she murmured. 'I'm completely yours.'

He kissed her with a small smile on his lips. 'I like that.' 'And I've had you everywhere,' she murmured, feeling the

raw, sharp throb he\'d left behind. 'You're all mine.' A spike of pain

tore through her and she winced, glancing down.

Red spread through the sheets beneath her.

*Merde. He better not see that.* She leant forward and kissed him, shifting to cover the blood on the sheets, hissing at the stab of pain.

'Does it hurt?' A flicker of guilt passed through his eyes.

*No. No regret. I'm yours.*

'I like it to hurt a little.' She found her wand, murmuring, 'vulnerasanentur.' The throbbing softened to a gentle burn and she smiled, vanishing the blood off the sheets and him without a sound. 'That's better. Just a little pain is *perfect*.'

Harry drew her into his arms. 'We don't have to do it again if

it hurts, Fleur.'

'I want to,' she whispered, curling up on his chest. 'Not every night, but now and again. I like having you every way I can. I like to feel it hurt and then see you smile.'

# Along Came a Spider

Clouds of steam drifted back along the gleaming red locomotive. A bustling throng of people swarmed upon the platform, doors slammed, and a swirling hubbub of chatter and shouts echoed off the brick arches.

\'There are a lot of people here,\' Fleur said.

'I'd imagine Voldemort doesn't want to kill an entire generation of witches and wizards. Not if he can avoid it.' Harry shrugged and scanned the crowd. 'Not many muggleborns, though.'

'No surprises there,' she replied. 'The ones that fought back have vanished or are hiding. They wouldn't send their children back to school, even if it's probably safer there.'

Steam gushed from the distant engine and a shrill whistle pierced the cacophony of the crowd.

\'It's leaving soon.' Fleur wrinkled her nose. 'I don't see why you can't just apparate again. You could've spent half a day longer with me.'

'Because while I can't imagine Voldemort would openly attack the train, a student could easily disappear from it.'

A faint pout crept onto Fleur's lips. 'Katie.'

'And Nev.' Harry slipped an arm around her waist and pulled her close to press a kiss to her cheek. 'And any of the others, if Voldemort goes after them.'

*But mostly Katie and Nev.*

'You're not their hero,' she whispered. 'Their dreams aren't more important than yours.'

'I'm not saving them for that.' Harry watched the doors slam along the length of the train and stepped from her embrace. 'I'm saving them because I don't want them to die. Katie and Nev are my friends.'

Fleur caught his hand as he stepped onto the train. 'I will continue our hunt, monCœur. It's a short list of names.'

He bent and kissed her. 'Be careful---\'

'I am more careful than you,' she retorted. 'You be careful.

Albus Dumbledore's scheming must be reaching its conclusion...'

*Yes. My time's running out.* Harry gave her fingers a squeeze, and watched her waver and vanish. The faint taste of marzipan faded from his lips, an awful weight settling on his heart. *I hate this. I wish it was still the Summer.*

He disillusioned himself and strode through the compartments until he found Nev, Hannah, Susan Bones, Ron and Ginny. 'Hello all,' he said, abandoning his invisibility.

'Bloody hell,' Susan muttered.

\'Harry.\' Nev grinned. \'Good timing, if a slightly dramatic entrance.\'

Ron glanced up from a copy of their defence textbook and grunted, Ginny gave him a small wave and Hannah and Susan smiled.

\'Hermione just left to go to the prefects\' carriage,\' Hannah

said.

\'Ron has decided not to go, despite claiming to be taking his responsibilities and education more seriously this year,\' Nev added.

\'Nobody does anything in the meeting except ignore Malfoy mouthing off and introduce themselves to the new prefects. I already know everyone in the year below because of Ginny and I have better things to do than listen to Malfoy.\' Ron raised his textbook. 'This is more important.'

*He's grown up.* Harry took a seat in the corner. *Maybe I should've been more patient with him, it's not like with me, he'd no reason to grow up early.*

\'Hermione didn\'t approve.\' Nev chuckled. \'She said, and I quote, *you have a responsibility to set a good precedent as a person in a position of influence and authority*, and then she stalked off.\'

\'She\'s been like that all summer,\' Ron grumbled. \'I told her I was going to take things more seriously now when I started actually studying and practising proper, useful magic, and she took it as an excuse to try and force quotes from muggle philosophers down my throat.\'

\'Which ones?\' Hannah asked.

\'All of them, I think.\' Ron sighed. 'If I hear that line from Gandhi again, I\'ll set fire to the library at headquarters and throw myself into the flames.\'

\'Which line?\' Harry asked. 'An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind?'

\'A man who was completely innocent offered himself as a sacrifice for the good of others, including his enemies, and became the ransom of the world. It was a perfect act,' Ron replied.

'Dumbledore said it. Hermione likes it. It's a good quote, but I've

heard it a few times too many.'

*And by a man, Dumbledore means me.*

'Katie and I have decided to protect you from Romilda Vane, Harry,\' Nev said. 'Ginny saw her on the platform boasting about how she was going to get a really hot boyfriend this year.'

Ron snorted. 'If she thinks you're going to ditch that veela chick for her, she's an idiot.'

Susan blinked. 'Katie's a veela?'

Nev snickered. 'I'm sure you all remember Fleur Delacour

from fourth year---'

'That really pretty girl from France?' Hannah asked. 'She's Harry's girlfriend,' Nev finished.

Susan frowned. 'For how long?'

'A year and a bit,' Harry said. 'I didn't really want to add to Rita Skeeter's gossip column, but now the secret's out.'

*Now everyone will try and take her away.* His stomach twisted and writhed, a fist of panic clamping about his throat. *But they can't.* He took a deep breath and squashed it all down. *I won't let them.*

\'Mum was wrong,\' Ron muttered.

\'Yes she was,\' Harry said. 'And I'd suggest that if she finds herself in our company again, she apologises to Fleur. Otherwise, she might not find herself in our company *ever* again.'

\'Yeah.' Ron grimaced. 'Sorry about that. She gets stuff stuck in her head and once it's there, it's hard to shake it loose. It\'s a good thing Dumbledore told her not to interfere, to be honest. Mum was all for dragging you back to headquarters with us and separating the two of you permanently.\'

'That wouldn't have been a very smart thing to try,' Harry

murmured, smothering a flash of cold fury.

Ron winced and set his book down. \'Took us two days to cheer Bill back up after Fleur rebuffed him, you know. He was very taken with her. By the time he was done moping, Mum was almost grateful you got her first. Don't think she liked the idea of having her as a daughter-in-law.\'

*He'll never so much as touch her.* Harry wrestled with the image of a burning ring of bronze upon Fleur's finger and the tall shadow of a man whose hair kept fading red and wore a dragon fang dangling from his ear. *I'll kill him first.*

A sharp rap echoed through the compartment and the door slid open.

\'Here\'s trouble,\' Neville muttered. \'Someone hide Harry and nobody eat or drink anything she gives him.\'

'Shut up.' Hannah swatted him on the arm. 'Don't cause

trouble.'

A dark-haired, dark-eyed girl strode into the compartment's

centre and shot Harry a smile, offering a slim slip of ribbon-bound paper. 'Hiya *Harry*, I'm Romilda, Romilda Vane. It's nice to finally meet you.'

\'Hi.\' Harry pulled the slip of paper from her fingers, avoiding

glancing down the low neckline of her blouse. 'What's this?'

Romilda tossed one into Nev's lap. 'The new professor asked if anyone knew where you were. I volunteered to come find you.'

'Thanks,' Harry said, unrolling it and holding it up. 'Dear Harry. I hope you would do me the honour of joining me for luncheon in compartment C. Professor H J Slughorn.\'

\'He\'s a Potions teacher,\' Ron said. \'Snape\'s teaching Defence. That\'s why I\'m reading this book first, the git isn\'t going to grade any of us fairly. He\'ll probably teach us everything wrong to soften us up for Voldemort.\'

Susan twitched and Romilda let out a little gasp of shock, sidling close enough to let her legs brush against Harry\'s and bathing him in strong, fruity perfume. Her fingers bunched in the material of her skirt and the hem fluttered about her thighs.

\'I guess we\'d better go, Nev,\' Harry said.

'Free food,' Ron said. 'Might as well take it. Probably better

than the trolley, too.'

Romilda shot Harry a long look and fluttered her eyelashes.

'I don't know if you can take anyone with you, but I'd *love* to go.'

Nev snorted. 'Romilda, did you know veela can throw fire if you upset them enough?'

\'No?' She looked down her nose at him. 'Is that, like, at all important?'

'Food for thought,\' Nev said, ushering her aside so Harry

could leave without having to brush past her.

A port-bellied, silver-moustached man in a fine-patterned waistcoat with straining brass buttons presided over a spread of expensive aperitifs arranged with a nonchalance that might've reduced Petunia to tears at her own inadequacy. He stood at the centre of a gaggle of students, caught up in three conversations at the same time, directing aperitifs and small glasses of elven wine to those around him. His belly protruded into the huddle like the swollen abdomen of a gorged spider.

His pale green eyes lit up when he caught sight of Nev and Harry. \'Everyone is here! Take a seat, take a seat, take a seat.'

Harry found himself at Slughorn's elbow staring across at

Blaise Zabini and a pair of blonde Slytherin sisters.

\'Help yourselves.\' Slughorn poured Harry a generous measure of elven wine before passing the decanter down the table. \'There\'s no need to stand on ceremony at my informal little gatherings.\' He pushed a few dishes across the table at the pair of blonde girls. 'Try these, Daphne and Astoria, they're honey and lemon. Ought to help with that sweet tooth!'

Harry picked at the partridge he found in front of him, removing the wings and legs with surgical precision and taking small mouthfuls of rich, gamey meat. Slughorn attempted to converse with the anti-social Carrow twins, turning a little red in the face when all his smiles and charm won was silence.

\'I heard that you were a professor here once before, sir,\' Flora said just as Slughorn was beginning to look like he\'d bitten off more than he could chew.

\'I was! This is my second tenure. Albus finally managed to tempt me back.\' He chuckled. \'He\'s been trying for years, of course, and I finally let him have his way. My retirement was growing a little too dull for my liking and I couldn\'t resist his most generous offer.\'

The conversation ebbed and flowed back about the table.

Melinda Bobbins captured Slughorn's attention for almost ten minutes, waxing eloquent about the apothecaries of her family, as Slughorn plied her with thin-sliced celery, red grapes, and an Italian blue cheese.

The two blonde girls watched with small smiles as

Melinda's proud babble drifted down the table.

*I'm sure I've never seen them before*. *Are they actually students?*

'Ah, how rude of me!' Slughorn twisted \'round. 'You've probably not spoken much. I remember how the house rivalries were back in my days here. Harry, well, I guess I don't have to introduce you, but this is Daphne and Astoria Greengrass.'

'Charmed,' Daphne murmured. 'We're actually big fans. I don't suppose you could teach me that ice spell you used on Malfoy?'

Harry chuckled. 'I'm sure it would suit you, but I'm afraid

not.'

Slughorn chuckled. 'Keep an eye on this pair, Harry. They're

not just very smart, but they'll be devastatingly beautiful in a few years too.' He leant forward and lowered his voice. 'I heard a little rumour about duelling trophies.'

Daphne smiled and glanced away.

Astoria beamed. 'We've got thirty four. And seven are golds. We usually compete as doubles, but Daph also has some individual ones.'

'Delightful!' Slughorn cried. 'A shame there's no trio event,

the three of you would make a formidable team!' He raised his glass

and tapped his knife against it until the ringing quelled the chatter.

'Welcome to my first little gathering! Hopefully the first of many!\'

*I hope they're not too frequent.* Harry glanced up and down the table as Slughorn greeted each and every person one by one. *The food is pretty good, but I've got more important things to do.*

'Ah.' Slughorn turned to Harry. 'And how could I not invite

*you* to our little gathering, Harry?\'

Zabini sneered from the other side of the table. \'It\'s a pleasure to be here, sir,\' he said.

\'Indeed, my boy, indeed.\' Slughorn nodded, all three chins bobbing together. \'When Dumbledore told me he had a student that might remind me of an old favourite of mine, I didn\'t believe him, but now I\'ve seen you, I can\'t deny the resemblance. Lily Potter, your mother, was one of my best students when I last taught at Hogwarts. I have some photos of our old gatherings that I simply must show you.\'

\'That would be very kind of you.\' Harry plastered a bright smile over his face. 'Everyone tells me I have her eyes.'

Slughorn\'s eyes grew dark. 'The very same shade of green, my lad! She was a brilliant witch.' He waved his knife across the table at Daphne and Astoria Greengrass. 'A very good example for the two of you, yes indeed. Lily was a marvellously creative spellcrafter, and no slouch in a duel either, oh no. She had a Hiccupping Hex so potent it once broke a boy's ribs after she lost her temper with him.' Slughorn released a fond sigh. 'Of course, she married that boy in the end, Harry. That's why you're here!'

*Something tells me that my mother wasn't the favourite Dumbledore compared me to.* Harry pulled on the same roguish grin he'd often seen Sirius wear. *That ought to throw him off.*

The luncheon stretched on through four more courses, a light dessert, and on further until an informal tea. Harry placed himself in the corner with the Carrow twins on one side and the Greengrass sisters on the other. Both pairs of girls murmured to one another, ignoring him while he sipped a raspberry-flavoured tea and indulged his growing sweet tooth with a slice of marzipan-rich stollen.

\'Harry!' Slughorn bustled over, squeezing his belly between the groups of chattering students and waving a thin, leather-bound book. \'I thought you might appreciate this when I found it while packing to move into the castle; it\'s the handful of photos from my little gatherings which have your mother in them.\'

\'Thank you,\' Harry said. \'I appreciate it. I've very few photos of my parents. I'll have to find some way to repay you.\'

\'Harry, my boy, you don\'t *repay* someone for a gift!' Slughorn clapped him on the shoulder and pressed the book into his hands. 'But if you insist on *reciprocating the favour*, then I\'ll let you know that I\'m quite fond of crystallised fruit.\' He blinked, then shook his head and smiled. \'Ambrosius sends me little packages from time to time. He owns Honeydukes, you know, but is still kind enough to remember an old mentor. One can never have too many sweets! Just ask Albus, I mean, Professor Dumbledore. Now you'd better hurry and change, not too long before we get into the station. Can\'t have you coming into school looking so casual, can we, Harry?\'

'Of course not, sir,\' Harry said, abandoning his tea cup amidst a scatter of others upon the table. \'And if I find something sweet, I\'ll be sure to remember you.'

He hurried back to the compartment.

'You missed all the introductions, Ron!' Hermione scolded, fiddling with a silver chain around her neck. 'You missed *everything!*'

'Let me guess.' Ron glanced up from his book. 'Everyone said their names, which we all mostly knew already, then Malfoy annoyed the whole group for the next few hours.'

Hermione huffed. 'Actually, he was very quiet. I heard his

father got quite badly hurt back at the start of the summer.' 'Hurt fighting for the *wrong side*,' Ron snapped.

She winced and chewed at her lip, then turned around to

face Harry. Her eyes went wide. \'Harry\... You need to get changed.'

He slipped his wand from his sleeve and transfigured his clothes into school robes. 'Sorted.' Harry took back his seat and turned to Nev. \'What did you think of our new Professor?\'

\'He liked you, those Greengrass girls, and a few others.\' Nev scowled. 'Only spoke to everyone else once and then moved on once he realised they weren't really rich, or smart, or gifted.'

\'He enjoys his little circle of friends and the favours they do for him,\' Harry said. \'He stays in contact with them after they go off and do things, and reaps the reward of their long friendships. I think he\'ll be a better teacher than Snape, though, and I can take the Potions NEWT with him here.\'

\'What did you get in your OWLs?\' Hermione demanded. \'Os mostly.\' Harry shrugged. \'Got an E in Potions and

Herbology, though, and only an A in Astronomy and a History of

Magic.\'

\'She got straight Os,\' Ron announced from behind his book. \'Wouldn\'t shut up about it for weeks.\'

Hermione shot Ron a scathing look, then a huge smile

spread across her face. 'You did very well, Harry.'

*But aren't you just ecstatic that you did better.*

He rolled his eyes.\'Dumbledore asked me to replace him in helping Professor McGonagall with her research, so I must have done well in Transfiguration.\'

\'You conjured and transfigured a giant raven,\' Nev said. 'I

heard---\'

\'That raven was you!\' Susan burst out. \'It took the examiners

half an hour to get my wand back from the blasted bird! I was so nervous I thought I was going to be sick, or faint, or both!\'

\'They could have just vanished it,' Harry said. 'Dumbledore said the examiners were to blame for not being able to bring themselves to get rid of my raven when they were supposed to.\'

\'You sabotaged half of the students in our year,\' Hermione muttered.

\'Not intentionally.\' Harry ignored the little flicker of doubt that passed across her face. \'Has anyone seen Katie?\'

Hannah and Susan exchanged a glance, but shook their heads, Ron, Ginny, and Hermione just shrugged. Paranoia stabbed at him.

\'I\'m sure she\'s fine,\' Nev said.

\'She\'s probably chattering about quidditch somewhere,\' Ginny added.

\'We\'ll find her on the platform in a minute,\' Nev said.

The train ground to a halt next to Hogsmeade\'s platform. Harry glanced about, gave them all a wave, then apparated away among the thestral carriages.

The two nearest skeletal, winged horses snorted and sniffed at his hands, pulling the carriage closer to nuzzle at his right wrist with cold noses. Their wide, dark, staring eyes gazed up at him with soft approval. A handful of students drifted past him, relieving him of his spectral company, and he spied, among a group of giggling girls, Romilda Vane.

*Does she not know how to do buttons?* Harry averted his eyes from her half-open top to scan the crowd for Katie. *She's fifteen-ish, she should be able to do buttons by now.*

\'Waiting for someone, Harry?\' Romilda sidled across, batting

her eyelashes. 'You can come---\'

\'Yes.\' Katie bounced over from amidst the crowd. \'Me.

Scram, little girlies.\'

Romilda scowled, looking Katie up and down, then stalked away, her gang of girls in tow.

\'Check everything you eat or drink,\' Katie said, watching Romilda\'s dark hair recede into the distance. \'In fact, check it, then let me check it, too. I doubt you know as much about love potions as I do.\'

Harry raised an eyebrow. 'Expert, are you?'

*She still likes you.* Fleur's words rose up from the back of his mind in a soft little whisper. *She loves you, but she wants you to be happy.* He smothered them.

\'Not like that.' She dragged him toward the nearest carriage. 'I don't need a love potion for you, anyway. I'd just need to pretend to get stuck in a trick step.'

Harry snorted. 'What are you doing, Stuck-in-a-Step-Katie?'

She laughed. 'Come on. Before Romilda comes back and tries to jailbait you into Azkaban.'

Harry grimaced. 'Thanks for that image.' He paused with one foot in the carriage. 'Not waiting for Nev?'

\'Do you want to find out how many more girls there are like Romilda? She\'s not even the worst, either. Romilda, along with several others, thinks you\'re attractive, and you\'re famous, too, so they like that. There're a handful of girls who read that Skeeter article about our relationship and took a *much* keener interest in you.\'

Harry rolled his eyes and took a seat in the middle of one side. 'One of them was probably you.' He shot her a grin. 'Put those enchanted handcuffs away, I'm not into being tied up.'

'I notice you left out tying someone else up...' Katie giggled. 'And remind me which one of us was seduced by an older girl at a tender age and led astray?' She dropped in beside him and leant against his side. 'Although, I guess that was partly me...'

*'Mostly* you.' Harry snorted, then sighed as the levity drained away. \'I\'m sorry about our last visit, we were ambushed by Weasleys and things got a bit heated.\'

\'I saw.\' Katie smirked. 'You still owe us money. Well,

Frenchie does.\'

Harry fished through his pockets but found no coins.

'Remind me how much in a bit and I'll pay you back.'

Harry.'

She winked. 'You don't have to pay me back with *money,*

'We would die horribly,' he said. 'Fleur is *very much* the

jealous type.'

'And I bet you love that.' Katie nudged his shoulder a couple of times and winked. 'Wind her up a little bit, watch her get all pouty, flustered and possessive, then take *advantage*.'

'I'd be lying if I said the thought didn't cross my mind from time to time,' Harry admitted. 'I'm also fairly sure Fleur likes it too.'

Katie wriggled about on her seat and leant against his shoulder to stare out across the Black Lake, a faint smile on her lips.

Harry's stomach twisted itself up in knots. *Maybe Fleur was right.* He tore his eyes away from the soft small smile on Katie's face and watched the castle grow larger until the carriage rolled up before the entrance.

'Coming?' He prodded her in the thigh.

'Takes more than one finger for that, Harry.' She giggled and wagged a finger at him. 'But you'll have to do better than a short carriage ride to find out how many it is.'

Harry chuckled. 'Don't worry, I've picked up a few *tips*. You'd be surprised what I can do with one finger.'

'Oh?' Katie waggled her eyebrows and made a show of fanning her face with her hand. 'And what *can* you do with one finger, Harry? What are you going to do to me now I'm trapped and helpless in this carriage with you.'

'You're the one blocking my exit,' he accused. 'You've trapped yourself.'

Katie laughed and jumped down. 'Better me than Romilda. At least *I'm* legal. That little slut's going to get some poor guy into a *lot* of trouble. One covert love potion and a couple of rumours and suddenly his life is ruined.'

Harry shuddered and grappled with a fist of sour heat and a churning stomach. 'I *really* don't like the idea of love potions. You'd be utterly *helpless* and you wouldn't even know it well enough to try and escape.'

The humour slipped from Katie's face. 'Yeah, I bet you do.' She screwed up her face and set off toward the Great Hall. 'They're horrible things. If I catch Romilda trying to dose you, I'll hit her so hard I break my knuckles across her face.'

Gaps scattered the four long tables.

*There're a lot of missing muggleborns.* Harry sidestepped the Greengrass sisters, who shot him an odd look, and slipped himself into one of the gaps in the middle of Gryffindor's table.

\'Did I tell you that I\'m the quidditch captain?\' Katie gushed. \'No. Congratulations, Dark Quidditch Captain Lady. Have

you planned to buy a new broom yet?\'

\'I already have a professional grade one,\' Katie replied. \'It was a present from a friend.\'

\'I think it was *lent* to you by a friend.' Harry tutted and shook his head. 'You're going to have to give it back this year at some point.'

*I'll be leaving halfway through if I can manage it.*

keep it.'

She pouted. 'You never specified how long I was able to

'I suppose I didn't.'

\'It\'s mine, then,\' she said.

\'Until I ask for it back,\' Harry added. \'You decided not to play anymore.' \'I was banned for life.'

\'Same thing,\' Katie whispered as Dumbledore began his

welcome speech lighting his lectern with a wave of a bright- coloured, striped, gloved hand.

\'Not quite,\' he murmured back.

He glanced down the table as Dumbledore's words about unity and togetherness washed over his head. Hermione caught his eye, studying him as if he were her Arithmancy homework. Harry waved at her and she twitched, looking away. Katie\'s goblet clattered onto the table, rolling past the empty places next to her where Angelina and Alicia had always been and over the edge to the floor.

*So like last year.* Harry ignored the sharp, blue eyes observing him from afar. *So like last year, but not.* He summoned the goblet back with one hand, catching it by the stem as it floated toward his outstretched hand.

Blue eyes crinkled in the corner of Harry\'s own, then Dumbledore turned to offer some remark to Snape, who stared down at his plate with a deep frown as Dumbledore piled celeriac onto it.

'Look,' Harry remarked to Katie. 'Dumbledore's trying to make sure Snape grows up to be big and strong.'

'That or he's finally decided to check and see if Snape really is a vampire.' Katie scrunched her nose up. 'I don't like that man. He's always been horrible to you.'

'He's also a Death Eater,' Harry murmured. 'And I'm fairly sure that Voldemort got your address from him.'

Katie's fork slipped through her fingers and thudded onto the table. 'He *what?!'*

Harry wrapped an arm 'round her shoulders as she made to rise. 'Don't do anything,' he whispered. 'I'm going to sort it.'

She clutched at his arm. 'My parents nearly *died*. *I* nearly died. If you hadn't...' Katie's mahogany eyes met his and a little of the colour left her cheeks. 'Harry...? What are you going to do\...?'

'Remind him that actions have consequences,' he said. 'Nothing you need to worry about, I'm just going to talk to him.' Harry leant his head to one side. 'Although, if he does something like it again, I might turn him into a lovely ice sculpture.'

Katie's lips pressed into a thin white line and she glowered up at the teachers' table. 'If he does anything like that again, I'll actually do something *very* Dark Lady.'

# The Hand of Ianus

Long black curtains still bearing the stains and scars of a decade of potions accidents now hung across windows that had seen Harry\'s favourite lessons. Sullen silence lurked in the gloom.

*He really isn't helping himself with these vampire rumours.*

Malfoy stared into the surface of his desk, ignoring a chattering Pansy. Hermione peered into the shadowed corners of the room and Ron buried his head back in their textbook.

\'Something tells me this is no longer going to be my best subject,\' Nev said.

\'Herbology's your best subject.\' Harry scoured the shadows and caught a faint ripple in the air before the board. 'I think the lesson's about to start.'

*He uses the Disillusionment Charm just for a dramatic entrance.* Harry chuckled. *Mine\'s better than his.*

\'Mr Weasley.\' Snape appeared next to Ron\'s desk and snapped his book shut with a flick of his wand. \'While I am glad you have finally learnt to read, I have not yet told you to open your books. You need to listen before you learn.\'

\'Ah,\' Nev whispered. \'Speech time.\'

Harry grinned and caught Snape\'s eye when the professor narrowed his eyes toward their spot at the back of the classroom. *I dare you, Snape.*

Snape drew in a deep breath and prowled \'round the first row of desks. \'This subject has been under the care of no fewer than

five teachers during your stint at this school. Each with their own methods, matters, and manner. With such... *inconsistency*, it is small wonder that so few of you have achieved the necessary level to study the Dark Arts for your NEWT.\'

*I\'m fairly sure we took Defence Against the Dark Arts.* Harry smirked to himself as Hermione writhed in her seat at the front of the class. *Yeah, I bet you didn't like hearing that.*

\'I will not lessen the infinite complexity of this subject with poorly referenced metaphor, or simile, nor---\' his eyes dipped to Hermione \'---will I ask that you commit entire tomes to memory.

Neither is a viable approach to defend against something that evolves so swiftly, fluidly, and dangerously as the Dark Arts do.\' Snape paused, moving back behind his own desk. \'If you want to survive them, you must become every bit as elegant, as subtle, as deadly, and as tenacious as they are.\'

*All this talk of dark.* Harry smothered his distaste. *It's just emotion, intent, and power. Only people that don't really understand glorify it like that. Adoration is the furthest state from understanding.*

Snape whirled, summoning a handful of dead spiders, and sending them floating across the class until they each had a crumpled arachnid on their desk. Ron glared at his and poked it to the far side of his desk.

\'When it comes to the Dark Arts, no number of books or words will truly help you understand what it is to face them.\' Snape flicked his wand upward in a sharp, jerking motion, muttering beneath his breath, and the spiders spasmed back to life.

Hermione gasped. 'Inferii!'

\'Imagine that each of these spiders is a true, human inferius,\' Snape drawled as the class dissolved into chaos. \'Deal with them as best you can, but try to avoid being bitten. They\'re mildly venomous.\'

\'Reducto,\' Nev said, blasting his to pieces.

*Well, that's not going to work, Nev.* Harry pinned his to the desk with the tip of his wand and tried to get a feel for the magic.

*Interesting, there's no aggression or hostility. This isn't the real deal, just a very similar enchantment. Snape knows what he's doing.*

Nev's spider's legs glowed with an eerie yellow aura and jerked back together. Pansy Parkinson shrieked as her spider put itself back together in her lap and scuttled under her shirt. Small flickers of flame began to bathe most of the desks, crisping and blackening the animated arachnids until they all fell still. Sore- looking red bites marked the hands and arms of most.

\'Stop playing with it, Potter,\' Snape drawled from the front. \'A true inferius will not stop just because you have touched it with your wand.\'

*Oh I beg to differ.*

He imbued his adaptation of the withering curse into the spider and watched it crumble to dust.

\'Were you facing an animated corpse, rather than a harmless arachnid---' Snape gave the bite-covered Pansy Parkinson a withering look \'---you would all, with a few exceptions like Mr Malfoy, likely be dead.\'

The remains of the spiders vanished and Ron relaxed over the dark scorch mark on his desk.

\'The larger the creature animated, the more magic is required,\' Snape said. \'For something like a spider, there is little difference to us between an inferius and a living spider save their ability to put themselves back together. However, the gain in strength of an enchanted human corpse, or something of similar size, is much more effective, and remains within the realm of possibility. This is, aside from the psychological aspect, why most inferii are human.\' Snape\'s eyes roved around the room. 'Are there any questions?'

Hermione's hand sprang into the air. 'What's *within the realm of possibility,* sir?'

'There is no *reliable* account of anything larger than a horse or bull or shark being successfully turned into an inferius,' Snape answered. 'In the last war, the Dark Lord utilised inferii rarely, but Grindelwald used them extensively toward the end of his wars.

There is a single account of him capturing and creating an inferius gryphon, but it was reputedly destroyed by Dumbledore's phoenix within a few moments of its release.'

'What about a dragon?' Seamus called out.

Snape's eyes flashed. 'You do *not* shout out during my class, Mr Finnigan. If you do, an inferius dragon will be a blessing compared to the detentions I will give you.' He tutted. 'It is, however, an impossibility. Magical creatures of a certain class like dragons, unicorns, phoenixes and basilisks are all heavily influenced by the natural alchemical magic of their bodies. Even should a wizard possess the power to create an inferius of such a potent creature, which I can assure you is impossible, they would not retain the magical abilities that make them so fearsome. Your dragon would be unable to breathe fire, Mr Finnigan.'

*A shame.* Harry\'s momentary regret at destroying the corpse of the basilisk faded alongside the tantalising image of

unleashing the seventy foot serpent inferius upon an unsuspecting Snape.

\'Mr Malfoy, perhaps you\'d be so kind as to explain your tactics in defeating your opponent?\' Snape commanded.

Malfoy scowled. \'I used fire.'

\'Three words is not an explanation,\' Snape reprimanded. \'What Mr Malfoy means is that fire sufficiently destroys the physical body of the inferius to unravel the magic bound to it. There are other ways, but fire is amongst the most efficient.\'

\'Can we not just blast it to pieces?\' Someone called out. \'I suspect, Mr Smith, that any attempt made to cast that

many powerful blasting curses before the inferius reaches you would

fail spectacularly. The corpse would tear you limb from limb, before its master added the remains of your foolish self to his collection of inferii. Are there any other foolish questions?\'

Hermione's hand crept into the air.

'Miss Granger...' Snape's lip curled. 'I ought not be surprised,

I suppose.'

She chewed her lip. 'Did you add to the spell? Our spiders weren't very aggressive...'

Snape nodded. 'That is a smarter question. I stripped out that part of the enchantment, because while we are headed for troubling times, we're not yet so desperate to unleash *true* inferii in the classroom. A wizard or witch that knows the magic well may be able to alter the enchantment, although this usually isn't to make them safe for study.' His eyes darkened. 'The Dark Lord often imbues his with a strong resistance to fire, which can make them an effective

weapon against most wizards and witches, especially if they're unable to escape.'

Ron's hand inched up. 'Are we going to see them being used by Voldemort?'

'The Dark Lord has used them in the past, so I wouldn't rule it out. However, multiple inferii are hard to keep tight control over and easily evaded by anyone capable of apparition.' Snape's wand flicked and their books all snapped open. 'I expect, on my desk at the start of our second lesson next week, fourteen inches on the characteristics of inferi and how to counter them. After that point, we will move on to cover other dangerous creatures you are likely to encounter, recapping werewolves, giants, and covering lethifolds in more detail. You may use the remainder of this lesson to begin planning and researching, either here or elsewhere.\'

*Dumbledore chose this curriculum carefully*. *All of*

*Voldemort's likely allies are on it.*

\'For those of you who were\... *unable* to handle your spider--- \' Snape\'s upper lip curled \'---Madam Pomfrey will be able to get rid of the rashes in a few seconds. I suggest a brief trip to the hospital wing, else you will spend the rest of the day in discomfort.\'

Pansy swept all her stuff off the desk and stalked out. \'Why are the rest of you all still here?\' Snape drawled.

\'Good question,\' Neville muttered, packing up his stuff. \'I have a free period next, so I\'ll be in the common room planning this and listening to Parvati and Lavender gossip about Hermione\'s nightmares. I\'ll see you after you\'ve endured Advanced Arithmancy.\'

*Nightmares?* Harry watched Hermione disappear out the door. *Is she using a time-turner too much like I was?*

said.

\'I don\'t remember asking to speak with you, Potter,\' Snape

\'Professor Dumbledore has offered me the opportunity to

take my NEWTs early, should I have written permission from the subject\'s professor,\' Harry said.

*And you better give it, especially after handing Katie's*

*address to Voldemort.*

\'And you expect me to grant this permission?\' Snape\'s sneer crept back.

\'I can demonstrate if you like.\' Harry let a little ice creep into his eyes. 'I've been practising since Katie nearly got killed in Diagon Alley. Just in case I find the ones responsible.'

Snape's brow creased. \'I will indulge your suggestion. I will cast a jinx at you and you will block it. Silently.\' His wand flashed up, casting three sizzling orange curses.

Harry threw up a blinding wall of silver light without a

word.

\'That\'s enough, Harry,\' Snape gritted. \'I do not want to have

to have Madam Pomfrey fix my eyesight because of a simple shield charm.\'

He let it drop.

\'It seems that I was mistaken to warn you last year that the Dark Lord had taken your boasting seriously,\' Snape murmured. \'Perhaps I would have done better to warn the Headmaster that *you* were taking things seriously. You cast that just by touching your wand.\'

*\'Did* you warn him?\' Harry asked.

\'No,\' Snape replied. \'You will find, Harry, that unless you yourself are the utmost extreme of opinion, you must make do with living in between others\' ideas. Dumbledore would be devastated to learn that you've marred your soul by casting the Killing Curse. He suspects you are not so innocent as you appear, but still clings to the hope that you're not irredeemable.\'

\'Nobody, no matter the nature of their crimes, seems irredeemable in his eyes,\' Harry whispered. 'A single, selfish spell seems far less a crime than others I've learnt about.'

\'So you know,\' Snape said. \'He told you, I presume.\' \'Dumbledore did.'

\'I will not ask for your forgiveness, Harry, nor do I expect you to forget what I have done.\' Snape\'s stoic countenance crumbled into something hollow. \'You\'re the only person who lost more than I did that night.\'

*You lost nothing you didn't deserve to lose.*

He kept his expression blank. \'My NEWT exam, sir?\' \'You have my permission,\' Snape said. \'I will write a brief

note to the headmaster. Do you intend to attempt your other subjects early as well?\'

\'I do.'

\'Good.' The corner of his mouth crooked into a hint of a smile. \'Your mother was a dedicated, brilliant witch; one who would have been ashamed of the talent you have until recently been squandering.\'

*If you thought so highly of her, you shouldn't have got her*

*killed.* Harry crushed the fist of ice clenched about his heart.

\'Professor McGonagall will not think twice about allowing you,\' Snape continued. \'And neither will Professor Flitwick, but I don\'t think you will convince Professor Vector, and nor will you manage to sway Professor Slughorn as you are.\'

\'I\'m a competent brewer,\' Harry said.

\'Competent, certainly,\' Snape said. \'But Professor Slughorn will only let you risk escaping his influence early if you are truly exceptional or already indebted to him. He is a consummate Slytherin---\' the smirk returned to Snape\'s lips \'---much like yourself, though in a different vein.\'

\'I want four subjects,\' Harry said.

'You should want four. Which means we will have to make you appear as a prodigious potioneer, one at a level few others have reached at your age.\'

\'More extra lessons,\' Harry deduced.

\'A few tips here and there.' Snape's dark eyes softened a fraction. 'Teaching is not about forcing children to recite recipes, it's about getting them to learn how to learn. You, like several others, consistently get an E, because you can perfectly reproduce the work of another, but you do not demonstrate anything creative or original yourself.'

Harry pursed his lips. *In theory, it's not so different from the rituals I've been doing. In practice, there's probably a lot of middle ground between the web of intent I know how to create for a ritual and making a potion out of it.*

\'I would be a fool to pass up tips,\' Harry said.

\'Yes, you would.\' Snape summoned a glass goblet from within his office and poured himself a drink of a very dark red liquid. \'Blackberry wine.\' He took a sip. \'I enjoy a glass from time to time during the day. It eases the frustration of marking and teaching, amongst other things. It is also, no doubt, the source of those ridiculous rumours about my vampirism.\'

*Other things being spying for both Dumbledore and Voldemort, the guilt from betraying your only friend to her death, and any shred of regret he has for almost sacrificing students.* Harry noted the neat row of glass goblets sparkling on the shelf within Snape's office and a bubbling cauldron spewing thick, white mist across the surfaces and onto the floor.

\'For now, the basic principles of true brewing will serve you best. It requires innate talent to truly grasp any branch of magic, though---' Snape's eyes flicked to Harry's '---the magic you cast upon your eyes suggests you already have a grasp of this that exceeds most.'

'I've picked up a few things.' Harry allowed himself a small smile. 'All sorts of interesting, abstract bits of magic, really.'

'I see. Well in potions that will serve you well. However, to apply it, you still need to understand exactly how each ingredient and how it's prepared will affect your potion.' Snape finished his goblet of wine, setting the glass cup down on his desk. \'This is something it takes years of experience to acquire. If you impress Slughorn enough, he will go out of his way to favour you, and in so doing, later favour himself.\'

'I'll have to impress him then.'

\'You are running late, Harry,\' Snape said. \'Professor Vector is unlikely to let you take her subject early anyway, but you\'re not helping your case.\'

Harry swept out. *For now, he's useful. I need that fourth NEWT, or I'll be stuck even if I'm victorious.* A small smile crept across his lips. *And I suspect he's fully aware of that. He knows he has to dance between Dumbledore, Voldemort and myself, now.*

\'Just on time, Harry,\' Professor Vector announced as he slipped in. \'I was just starting to go over our material for the year.\'

\'Sorry, Professor Vector,\' Harry said. \'I needed to speak with Professor Snape about my NEWTs.\'

\'Ah.\' Professor Vector nodded. \'I\'ve heard rumours of this. I\'m afraid, Harry, that this winter is altogether too early for you to be taking a subject this complex. However, should you prove yourself capable, I might be open to letting you take it this summer instead.\'

*Disappointing, but not unexpected.* Harry took the remaining free seat beside Hermione. *Defence, Transfiguration, Charms, and Potions it will have to be, then.*

\'Thank you, professor,\' he said.

At the front of the class Professor Vector sketched four dimensional matrices in bright, green fire. 'Every spell, enchantment, or piece of magic can be described as a magical mapping of one thing to another. Of course, the more complex ones require incredibly complicated mathematical models to describe the mapping, and in most cases we simply don't have an understanding of magic detailed enough to be capable of that. For simpler pieces of magic like apparition, we can write out a transformation matrix that allows us to mathematically model exactly how magic folds our dimensions to allow us to apparate.'

Harry groaned. *I prefer purple runes. And I hate matrices.*

Hermione scribbled her way through a page of notes in increasingly obscure shorthand notation.

*I miss the simple stuff I didn't have to pay attention to already.* He sighed and began to write. *Fleur\'s always going to be better than I am, anyway.* A gentle ache tugged at his heart as he worked his way through the lemmas and the reflection of the green- eyed, silver-haired girl in the Mirror of Erised welled up amidst the matrices. *I can't wait to be done with all this.*

'Did you really think you'd be able to take this exam in four months\' time?' Hermione hissed. 'That's *deluded,* Harry.'

'Rude.' He shot her a sharp look. 'But no, I'll need all two years for this one. The other four I should have a good chance with.'

She chewed her lip. 'You *are* the best in the year at Defence and Transfiguration, and I doubt you'll struggle with Charms, but potions... You only got an E.'

'I'd be happy with another E,' Harry replied. 'But yes, potions is the one that will be tough. Fortunately, I can skive off all my other lessons and just focus on that.'

Hermione huffed. 'You know that school isn't just about exams, Harry. It's important you socialise with your peers while your brain is developing, it affects how the brain develops.'

'Says the girl who spent a month in the library not talking to anyone and not sleeping before our OWLs,' he retorted. 'I've got more important things to do than listen to the girls gossip about you having nightmares.'

Her expression darkened. 'I don't have nightmares.'

Harry snorted. 'Sure.' He took a deep breath. 'Listen, Hermione. I don't particularly care whether you think I'm doing the right thing or not, but you can keep your thoughts to yourself. I'll do the same, since that's only fair. You can do you. I will do me. Does that sound bearable to you?'

Hermione's fingers tightened around her quill. 'You're not the same boy I was best friends with.'

'And whose fault is that, Hermione?' He shuffled his chair away from her and bent over his notes, ignoring her muttered response.

*Not completely yours, of course. But you were there, watching me try to play hero until I slipped back into the emptiness and drowned.* He stifled a shudder and tried to smother the ache beneath his ribs. Fleur's face hovered behind his closed eyelids, a soft warm smile on her lips. *Fleur and Salazar dragged me out and I'm not going back. Not ever.*

# That's so Raven!

Piles of scrambled eggs, stacks of toast, mountains of bacon, sausages, fried tomatoes, and mushrooms spread across the Gryffindor table. Harry spun his plate round, imagining sugar-dusted croissants and sweet pastries. A sigh slipped from his lips.

\'What\'s wrong?\' Katie offered him the bacon. 'I *can* share

bacon, you know.'

A stab of frustration lanced through him. *What's wrong is I'm stuck here and Fleur is all the way over there.*

\'Nothing.\' Harry wiped the frown from his face and pinched a rasher of bacon before Katie whisked the plate away. \'How was your first day back?\'

\'Boring,\' Katie groused. \'Apparently being quidditch captain means I have to organise everything myself.\'

\'That was a surprise to you?\'

\'Yes,\' Katie grumbled, helping herself to everything Harry had left. \'McGonagall wouldn\'t let me delegate responsibility.\'

\'Really?\'

\'She said that referring to my teammates and subordinates as minions wasn\'t how a captain should act.' Katie pouted. 'But they *are* my minions.'

Harry laughed. \'You\'re not supposed to let them hear you refer to them as minions, that\'s poor Dark Mistressing.\'

\'I cry your pardon, your Supreme Darkness,\' Katie said.

\'Where\'s Nev?\' Harry asked.

\'Room of Requirement,\' Katie answered. \'He and Hannah have been bribing the house elves to bring them breakfast up there.\'

\'He\'s growing so sneaky.\' Harry sighed. \'I remember when he was a shy, stuttering chubby thing.\'

\'He still is sometimes.\' Katie's grin turned wicked. \'You just

have to say the right sort of things when Hannah\'s nearby.\'

\'Like what?\' Harry smirked. 'Something *suggestive?'*

\'Oh, just a few questions. Ones like... How far have you gone? Do you still get all shy taking your clothes off? Does Hannah like it if you pull on her pigtails?\'

\'You\'re a cruel girl,\' Harry said, stifling a laugh with a mouthful of bacon.

\'You taught me well,\' she beamed. \'I convinced Luna to ask him the last one in front of Professor Sprout.\'

Harry choked and coughed on his bacon, eyes streaming, until Katie offered him her drink, and patted him on the back.

\'You ok?\' She giggled.

\'Wait until I\'m not swallowing next time.' Harry stole a gulp of orange juice. 'Where did you get this?'

Katie snatched the goblet back. \'I had to bribe a house elf myself to get that,\' she growled. \'Next time, I\'ll poison it.\'

*It won\'t work. I'm immune.*

\'Don\'t you have a class to go to?\'

\'Charms,\' Harry said, \'then Potions, and Transfiguration.\' \'A full day,\' Katie remarked.

\'Very.\'

\'Think any of them will let you take the subject early?\' \'Flitwick and McGonagall, hopefully. I\'ll have my

Transfiguration NEWT before you do.\'

\'You can help me at the end of the year, then.\' Katie leant

across him to retrieve a toast rack. 'But just with Charms.'

\'If I\'m still here,\' Harry said.

\'Where else would you be?\' Katie asked. '*Don't say France...'*

\'France is nice,\' Harry teased. \'I know a beautiful spot with a willow tree.\'

She slapped butter onto her toast and scraped it back and

forth. 'Go away, then.'

Harry watched her snap a bite out of the toast triangle with a raised eyebrow. \'Don\'t you have any classes of your own?\'

\'Not this morning.\' She sighed. \'I might as well organise the quidditch practices and plays. All my friends are younger than me and have fewer free periods.\'

\'I\'ll have a lot more than you after today.'

\'You think Flitwick and McGonagall will just let you stop coming to classes?\' Katie lowered her toast and stared at him with wide eyes. 'Really?'

\'Hopefully. I\'ll probably not go anyway if I\'m honest. There\'s no point in me being there.\' He poked her shoulder. 'That means I'll be about to keep you in check, budding Dark Lady that you are.'

She beamed. \'You can come and keep me company in the

common room.'

\'On second thought... maybe I could jump off the Astronomy

Tower.'

Katie slid across to elbow him, dropping her hand onto his

thigh and munching on her toast, showering them both in crumbs. \'If you have to jump off something, try and land on Romilda Vane. That girl needs a wake up call. Who\'d choose a normal girl over someone like Fleur.\'

\'I\'m sure she\'s a nice girl.\' Harry wrinkled his nose. \'But she needs to learn how to do the buttons on her blouse and realise that she\'s grown up too much to keep wearing her second year uniform.\'

Katie snorted. \'Like that\'s going to happen. If she puts on any more eyeliner, she\'ll look like she gets as little sleep as Hermione.\'

\'She can put on as much makeup as she likes. It's not going to change anything.\' He slid himself out of the bench and patted her on the cheek, smothering a stab of unease as she caught his fingers, but left her cheek pressed into his hand. 'Time for Charms. Catch you later.'

'Come find me after,' she murmured.

Harry nodded and set off through the corridors, slipping through groups of students. They moved in huddles of house colours, whispering in low voices and clutching their wands.

*No unity here.* He kept his wand ready in his sleeve. *The*

*war's just a few heated words away.*

Flitwick hovered just inside the door to the class when Harry got there. Everyone else chatted in small groups upon the rows.

\'Harry,\' he squeaked, waving a thin piece of parchment in the air. \'This is for you, if you can perform a quick example for the class.\'

\'Is it a permission slip, sir?\' Harry asked.

Several of the Ravenclaws narrowed their eyes and muttered to each other. Anthony Goldstein sneered into his hand and shook his head.

\'It is indeed, Harry.\' Flitwick ushered him to the front to stand by a crystal wine flask.

*Wine to vinegar.*

Harry grinned. \'It\'s a bit early for me.\'

\'You can drink it after the example, Harry,\' Flitwick replied. \'No thanks, sir. Non-verbal?\'

\'Of course.\' Flitwick bobbed his head. \'Wouldn\'t be a perfect example otherwise.\'

Harry drew his wand and tapped the flask on the side. The deep, burgundy transitioned to dark brown with a clear, crystalline chime.

\'Still thirsty, Harry?\' Flitwick proffered him the note. \'Not even a little bit, sir,\' Harry said.

\'That is a perfect example of how to turn wine to vinegar using a nice little non-verbal charm you\'ll all be learning toward the end of this year.\' Flitwick stepped up onto one of the stacks of books beside his desk so he could see all the way to the back. \'You will note that Harry, unlike myself, does not bother with the proper wand motion. This is because Harry has power enough not to need the extra precision and can afford to waste a little magic to save time. It is not something I expect you to be trying until next year, since it requires a very intimate understanding of what you\'re trying to accomplish and a supreme level of focus.\'

\'So it\'s better to use the full wand motion?\' Hermione asked. \'In principle, using the full wand motion and incantation is

the most efficient and safe method for every spell, Miss Granger,\'

Flitwick replied. \'However, in practice, it's often preferable to save time and to conceal the nature of the spell by casting it without the motion or incantation. It is crucial when duelling, for example.'

Hermione\'s eyes flicked to Harry, to the flask and back again. She chewed her lip, fiddling with the slim silver chain around her neck.

\'There\'s no point in you wasting your time doodling at the back of my class, Harry,\' Flitwick squeaked. \'Go find Professor McGonagall, she wants to discuss a few things with you.\'

\'Thank you, sir.' Harry grabbed his things and swept out.

*Two down, two to go. Progress.* He knocked upon the door to McGonagall's office. *And transfiguration should be a sure thing.*

\'Come in,\' McGonagall called.

Harry opened the door and stepped in. \'Professor Flitwick said you had some things you wanted to speak with me about?\'

McGonagall pulled her wand out and swept back the furniture to the edge of the room. \'I do. Professor Flitwick and I have come to the conclusion that there is little point in keeping you in our classes. It has been evident for some time you are well ahead of most of your peers... and also that you won't attend lessons you don't feel are a worthwhile use of your time.'

\'I *do* have other things to worry about, Professor.\'

Her lips thinned. 'You did, to Madam Pomfrey\'s dismay, demonstrate sufficient knowledge of our seventh year syllabus to satisfy me during the Triwizard Tournament's second task. Quite impressive for a fourth year, Mr Potter.\'

\'So I can take it early?\'

\'Indeed you may.\' McGonagall sent a piece of parchment sailing across the room from her desk into his hand. \'I wish to discuss the project the headmaster suggested you replace him for.\'

*Three down.* He smothered a faint ray of hope and the soft ache that sprang up at the thought of leaving and returning to Fleur. *Just a few more months, then I'll be free.*

\'Dumbledore didn\'t go into a great deal of detail,\' Harry said. \'Just mentioned I needed to be able to sustain a partial, human transfiguration for a while.

\'A very basic description of your role.\' McGonagall frowned. \'I will not burden you with too many details, Mr Potter, but the aim of my project is to try and study the point at which a partial transfiguration of one\'s self into an animal becomes a full one. It is my goal to try and better determine, and maybe even affect, the mental effects of such a transfiguration.\'

\'I take it that would have wide-reaching implications?\'

\'An animagus, Mr Potter, as you are well aware, is able, once they are fully capable of using their form, of retaining most of their faculties even if they are influenced while within their animagus body. Ordinary human to animal transfiguration leaves the altered wizard or witch with no more intelligence or understanding than the animal they have become. A partial transfiguration can have either effect, depending on the part of the body altered. Should I be able to affect this then the result will be any gifted transfiguration user could, in effect, have an infinite number of animagus forms.\'

\'You\'re an animagus, aren\'t you, professor?\'

\'As you may well be by the end of this project,\' McGonagall replied. \'We will delve far enough into the principles behind it that you may well be able to take great strides toward following in your father\'s footsteps.\'

\'It might be fun, I suppose,\' Harry murmured.

*And useful.* A small smile spread across his lips. *At the very least, I might be able to surprise Fleur.*

McGonagall pursed her lips. 'We may as well get started, Mr Potter.'

\'If you like, professor.'

\'You used to have to hold a mandrake leaf in your mouth for a month,\' McGonagall recalled, a faint smile playing across her face. \'But simpler, more ingenious ways to influence the body to change have been devised since then. Your father and his friends stole all the leaves from the mandrakes in the greenhouses, causing a whole class of first years to faint in their next class when they mistakenly emptied out the apparently empty beds without ear guards.\' She handed him a small, green pill about the same size as his thumb nail. 'The transfiguration is easier and more sustainable if you use the form

most compatible with your own, so at the very least you will learn the creature you could become as an animagus.\'

Harry picked the pill out of McGonagall\'s palm, holding it

between his thumb and forefinger. 'What is it?'

\'Eat it, Mr Potter. I have not poisoned it.\'

*It wouldn't matter if you had.* He slipped it into his mouth and choked it down, grimacing at the strong, bitter taste of wood.

\'What now?\' Harry asked.

\'That pill, Potter, has saved you two months of preparation for learning your form. As it is, you should close your eyes and let your innermost thoughts guide you.\'

\'Will it be the same form as my Patronus?\'

*I would very much enjoy being a fire-breathing, giant eagle.* He let a faint smile spread across his lips. *And Fleur would definitely like it if my form was an Anzu.*

\'Sometimes,\' McGonagall said. \'Most often it is not. A patronus embodies your positive emotions. The animagus form is the most suitable creature for your soul.\'

\'Interesting.\'

*Souls again.* He closed his eyes. *They crop up in all the best bits of magic, it seems. I should learn more about them, when I have the time.*

A slim, black body shimmered in faint sunlight, slender scales tapered away, and dark eyes gleamed like gimlets. The dispassionate, distant curiosity of the hunter; its patience, its power.

Playful, whimsical intelligence lurked behind a long cruel-edged beak, curving talons, and sleek feathers.

*A raven.*

The curiosity caught hold of him like a baited hook and the sense of the raven slipped closer, permeating his mind, twisting his thoughts over and over in loops as the world loomed larger and the ceiling rose away from him.

*Old-cold-living-stone.*

It rang under his talons as he tapped them against it, intrigued that what was not-alive felt so strange. He clacked his beak, hopping from the floor to the warmer, dead-wood-once-trees, and surveyed the room. Dipping his beak into his feathers he tilted and tipped his head to take in as much as he could.

*Two-legged-no-wings-no-feathers.* He studied the grey hair and wrinkled, pale skin. *Not prey. Not threat.* He clacked his beak at it, hopping closer.

The creature moved with sudden speed and the desk crumpled underneath him, pitching him onto the floor. He released an indignant squawk, then found himself staring at his fingers on the stone, and the sense of the raven faded away.

'Are you ok, Mr Potter?'

\'How curious.\' He patted himself down and checked for feathers. \'I truly *was* the raven.\'

*If I'm stuck with feathers, Fleur's never going to let me hear the end of it.* He smothered a burst of laughter. *All my bird jokes are about to come home to roost.* He snickered under his breath. *Bawk. Bawk.*

\'A raven.\' McGonagall\'s lips pursed. \'Nobody is ever how we quite expect them to be, I suppose. At least I know you have not been studying to become an animagus alone. Your father, Black, Lupin, and Pettigrew were at least able to look after each other.\'

A sudden certainty struck him. *That's why Dumbledore volunteered me.* Harry flicked his wand into his palm and back into its holster several times. *He wanted to know if that was how I was leaving the castle unnoticed.*

\'How do you *not* become the raven?\' Harry asked.

\'You do not,\' McGonagall said. \'The reason the animagus is able to distinguish themselves from their animal form, is because the animal form is similar enough to them to conflate the two. You will become the raven and the raven will become you.\'

\'It sounds... complex.\'

\'It takes a great deal of self-study, understanding, and thought to be able to see the similarities between yourself and the form, and even more to bring them together.\'

Harry nodded. *The animagus form might be useful, but it*

*sounds like it's going to take too much time to be a priority.*

\'So what will we be doing next time?\' he asked.

\'We are not done, Mr Potter,\' McGonagall remonstrated. \'Now we know which form suits you best, I can devise the optimum partial alterations to use. In the meantime, focus on transfiguring your hair into the feathers of the raven. Just your hair, mind you.\'

Harry flicked his wand back out, imagining the feathers he had felt over himself, losing himself in the strange, stilted memories of the raven.

\'Just the feathers,\' McGonagall chided.

Harry frowned, clearing his mind of all the thoughts of feathers and the raven. He rose two inches, regaining his usual height, and the dark feather tips covering his arms retracted back into fine hairs.

*Just the feathers*. *I wonder if Fleur will know anything about this. She grows cute little white feathers when she gets mad.*

Tiny, dark feathers spread across his skin, cascading down his neck and along his arms, and rising from his head in a sleek, ebony crown.

\'How do you feel?\' McGonagall asked. \'Like Harry,\' he said.

\'No raven?\' \'None.\'

\'Try changing all your skin now,\' she suggested, then wrinkled her brow. \'No. Spend some time studying the anatomy of the raven, we\'ll continue on when you have a firmer grasp of what you\'re transfiguring yourself into. It will be a more reliable study if you\'re not just relying on your innate instincts from when you were the raven.\'

\'I should go?\' Harry raised an eyebrow.

\'Yes,\' McGonagall said. \'It's nearly time for your next class.

You were the raven for a while.' She raised a finger. 'That is something to be wary of, Harry. Animals do not always perceive time quite the same way we do. Do you have any questions before you leave?\'

\'Not that can\'t wait until next time,\' he replied. \'I can understand why my father, Sirius, Lupin and Pettigrew named their animagus forms now.\'

\'It is not quite the same as being yourself to begin with,\' McGonagall murmured. \'Though I felt no need to name my own form. The further you progress to becoming a true animagus, the less separate you will feel from your other form.\'

\'I won't name mine,\' Harry decided. \'It might actually detract

from the process.\'

\'Yes.' McGonagall smiled a faint smile. \'I daresay it might.\'

\'Thank you for letting me assist you, professor,\' Harry said.

*And now I know Dumbledore doesn't know how I enter and leave the castle without triggering the wards.* Harry grinned and set off in the direction of Slughorn\'s class. *Let's hope Slughorn changed the decorations. I can't imagine he likes to teach in the dark.*

Steam, smoke, and the swirling storm of sweet scents assaulted Harry's nose as he pushed open the door to the lesson. Slughorn sat on the front of his desk, his belly protruding out into the class beneath a box of crystallised fruit. Round tables and collections of velvet-backed chairs scattered the lab where Snape's rigid, neat rows of desks had run.

\'Welcome, welcome.\' Slughorn chuckled, chins wobbling, and beckoned Harry into the classroom. \'Take a seat.\'

A dour-faced Malfoy, the older Greengrass sister, and the other Slytherins took the table around a small cauldron of bubbling Polyjuice. The Ravenclaws huddled around the clear cauldron of what Harry presumed was Veritaserum. Harry glanced into the cauldron on the remaining table as he was joined by Hermione, Ernie

Macmillian, and Ron. An iridescent liquid gave off soft, white mist in gentle spirals.

He stiffened. *Amortentia. Love potions.* A little ball of unease knotted in his stomach. *I hate love potions.*

\'Well now!\' Slughorn clapped his hands together. \'Who can identify these potions?\'

Hermione\'s hand shot up.

\'Yes, Miss Granger.\' Slughorn\'s eyes passed over the others who had raised their hands, then returned to her.

\'Polyjuice, Veritaserum, and Amortentia.\' Hermione gestured to each cauldron in turn.

\'Quite right, Hermione,\' he said. \'You don\'t mind if I call you by your first name, do you? You can call me Horace at my little gatherings, of course.\'

'No, sir.\' She smiled and the bags under her eyes lightened a

touch.

*No nightmares, huh? Sure there aren't.* Harry shook his

head. *I wonder what she dreams of.* He smothered a flash of the shadow beside Fleur, the burning ring of bronze, and the withered branches of the willow, swallowing hard and staring into the shimmering Amortentia. *I guess we all have things that terrify us.*

Harry crushed the knot of anxiety in his stomach and leant forward to inhale the mist. A flood of pleasant aromas washed over him: the subtle, sweet smell of burnt holly, a faint hint of almonds and sugar, a whiff of broom polish, coffee, and a soft tang of tomato soup and old paint.

\'Ah.\' Slughorn set his box of sweets aside. \'Harry knows a thing or two about Amortentia, it seems. Care to tell us what you smell?\'

Hermione's eyes bored into Harry.

*They'll all know soon.* He swallowed down a stab of panic.

*Too many people have seen Fleur and I for it to safely stay a secret.*

\'Broom polish and marzipan,\' Harry said. 'Quidditch, I think. And I have developed a bit of a sweet tooth over the last couple of years.'

Slughorn's lips twitched, but the crinkles at the corners of his eyes softened. 'A sport we all love, my boy!'

Hermione\'s lips pursed and her brow creased. 'You stopped playing quidditch ages ago.' She held his gaze.

Harry touched her thoughts and found a twist of fear and derisive disbelief. A flash of him standing over the fallen troll from First Year and a tear-blurred silhouette of him in the Hospital Wing in Second Year flickered across the eye of his mind drowned in endless soft sadness. Hermione flinched away from his gaze and jolted the cauldron, soaking her book in Amortentia and flushing red.

'But I've not lost my love for it. I just need to get my Firebolt back off Katie.' He shot the class a bright smile. 'Easier said than done, I'm afraid.'

\'What about that one?\' Malfoy pointed at a small cauldron

on the corner of Slughorn's desk.

'Ah,' Slughorn breathed. '*This* one.' He shuffled off the desk and picked the tiny cauldron up, tilting it a fraction to show off a shining, bright gold liquid. 'This one's a little bit special.'

\'Felix Felicis,\' Hermione gasped, dropping her ruined book. \'That\'s liquid luck; it\'s *really* valuable and almost *impossible* to brew.\'

*And very useful, I'd imagine*. Harry watched the gleaming potion swirl like molten gold, bright sparks burst like fireworks above its surface, falling like showers of shimmering stars. *The little bit of luck needed to find the last horcrux...*

\'To liven things up on our first day together, I\'ve decided we shall have a little competition.\' Slughorn set the cauldron down and pulled a slim bottle of Felix Felicis out of the breast pocket of his plum and cream-chequered waistcoat. \'Whoever brews the best version of the Draught of the Living Death shall find themselves the owner of twelve hours of the best fortune they will ever have.\'

*That would be very useful.* He glanced at Hermione and Malfoy, who were both staring at the bottle. *But I'm going to have competition.*

\'Have you ever taken it, sir?\' Terry Boot asked.

Harry flicked through the pages of his textbook to the Draught of the Living Death while everyone else looked on, making a careful note of the ingredients. *What did Snape say about the importance of what you're adding and how you're adding it affecting the potion?*

\'Twice.\' Slughorn\'s eyes turned a little distant. \'Two of the most perfect days you could ever wish for, but, since it is banned from being used in any professional or competitive activity, you can only take it on an ordinary day. Better get started, now, there\'s not long left to brew in.\'

Harry strode across the class and selected the best looking ingredients from the cupboard while the rest of the class opened

their books. Hermione hurried across to rummage through the stack of spare textbooks.

He assembled his ingredients beside his cauldron and studied the recipe. *Things are clearly meant to go into the mix slowly and easily, like falling asleep, but it's not intended to be that benevolent.* Harry drummed his fingers on the desk. *Which makes sense, given it's the Draught of Living Death. Snape said how it was added is important, so presumably the slower, the better, but with a little bit of an edge to it.*

Using the edge of the knife, he stripped off the hardened outer skin of his roots and sliced them along their length. Hermione glowered at him, almost jumping to force her weight down on the knife she was pressing against the desk.

*She\'s crushing the beans.* He watched her for a moment.

*That's actually a good idea, they'll go in more easily, and the crushing probably helps with the intent a bit.* Harry shrugged and mimicked her. *Either way, if she's doing it too, it won't matter .*

He dropped them in. His potion turned a perfect, blackcurrant and faded to a smooth lilac. Stirring in sets of sevens, his potion shifted toward a pale pink. Hermione threw in an extra stir in the opposite direction every now and again.

*Not entirely sure if that will help.* Harry watched her for a moment. *In theory, it might reverse a little of the effect of the seven clockwise stirs and slow down the formation of the potion, which could help its potency, but equally, it might just ruin it.*

\'I think that\'s time!\' Slughorn tucked away a splendid silver pocket watch and shuffled around the cauldrons, nodding and tutting until he came to Hermione\'s. \'Oh,\' he cried. \'Oh vey well done, Hermione, very well done indeed. This is almost perfect. We may have a winner!\'

Malfoy dropped his silver spoon with a disgusted sneer and flopped back into his chair.

Slughorn drifted round the table, wincing a little from the dark fumes of Ron's cauldron, and paused before Harry's. \'Oho, but what\'s this? Competition, Hermione!\' He glanced between the two of them and a faint shadow passed across his face. \'It seems you\'ve inherited your mother\'s talent for potions, Harry. Well done, quite remarkably well done, even if Hermione gave you a run for your money.\'

\'Thank you, professor,\' Harry accepted the little bottle of gold and slipped it into a pocket. Hermione stared at the lump in his pocket and chewed at her lip so hard a smear of crimson marked her teeth.

\'Don\'t go using it for something silly,\' Slughorn said. 'And be warned, while it will grant you *fabulous* luck, it only helps you get what you *think* you want. You may change your mind once you have it.'

\'I think I'll save it, professor.\' Harry caught the fleeting shadow in Slughorn's eyes. \'I\'m going to have to get you a gift now, sir. For your next little gathering and the one you hosted on the train.'

\'Oh there\'s no need for that, Harry!\' Slughorn beamed. \'It\'s your *prize!* Still, if you're going to insist, get something the two of us will both enjoy. You're not the only one with a sweet tooth!\'

Hermione snorted and started to tidy up her things.

\'Clear away and then off you go.\' Slughorn strolled a little further round and leant on the side of the table beside Harry. \'I have heard from the grapevine you intend to take your NEWTs early?\'

sooner.\'

\'I do,\' Harry said. \'It will let me pursue my other interests

\'Severus implied as much and even implied it might be a

good idea, which is no small praise. I can't say Severus and I are close, but he is a most talented brewer.\' Slughorn\'s chins bobbed down onto the brass buttons of his waistcoat. \'I\'ll evaluate your progress before deciding myself. Can\'t have you leaping too early and wasting all that talent when a little patience might've produced a perfect pupil.\'

*Damn. Three and a half.* Harry smothered a knot of frustration. *But I'll get there.*

\'You probably know best, professor,\' he said.

\'I have spent a lot of time teaching.\' Slughorn gestured to the photos lining the walls of his office. \'If there\'s anything you want to know, or even if there's something you're just curious about, feel free to come and ask. I've picked up a fair bit over my years, and if I can't help, then I\'d be happy to direct you to the right place. I do my best to do it for all my students.\'

\'That\'s very generous of you, professor,\' Harry said. \'Nonsense!\' Slughorn shuffled back around to his desk. \'It\'s

what any good teacher should do. If I can help someone on their way

to a glittering career somewhere, then I should.\'

\'As long as they remember your help,\' Harry replied, smothering the dryness before it seeped into his words. \'It\'s not fair that your important assistance should be forgotten.\'

\'I do get a lot of birthday presents,\' Slughorn confessed. \'Crystallised pineapple, Harry? It\'s my favourite.\'

\'Thank you.\' Harry selected a small piece and bit it in half.

A thick sweetness coated his tongue with the faintest hint of pineapple.

*Fleur would probably like these.* He chewed on the second half of the sweet and let the sugar dissolve in his mouth. *I should buy her something from Hogsmeade. Now she's quit her job at Gringotts, it's not so easy for her to feed her sugar addiction.*

# A long Petal of the Sea

Drizzle pattered against the kitchen windows, trickling down the clear panes. Condensation blurred the swathe of green and grey beyond the glass as dusk fell.

Fleur touched her wand tip to the wall, tugging at the threads of magic swirling within it, and released a little shiver as the temperature rose a few degrees. *Much better.* She settled back down in the chair and sipped her hot chocolate, flicking through pages of children's stories and legends from the bottom shelves of Papa's library. *A wand. A cloak. A stone.* She copied the pages of sketches with the Gemino Charm and added them to the shoulder high stack on the table. *And not one of these are remotely similar.*

The breeze spattered drops of rain against the window, then faded away. She vanished the condensation and studied the fading light in the sky.

*The full moon will be up soon.* Fleur stirred sugar into her hot chocolate and glanced at the picture of the Lake District. *And that means Travers's raiding of the small magical communities there will start.*

A soft snap echoed through the house. 'Fleur?'

*Harry.* Her heart leapt and she jumped from her chair, spilling hot chocolate over the drawings. *Merde.* She glanced at the mess and vanished the whole lot. *They weren't useful anyway.*

He strolled into the kitchen waggling a bottle of swirling

gold. 'Look what I have?'

*Felicis?*'

Fleur tugged it from his fingers and studied it. 'Is this *Felix*

Harry grinned. 'It is.' He plucked it out of her hand. 'I was

thinking we should use it the next time we find a member of

Voldemort's inner circle.'

*Maybe if you drink it while we're choosing, it might work, but there's not many of the inner circle left and we don't even know if any of them have this horcrux.*

She shook her head. 'I don't know if that would work. I would rather you save it for the next time you do something reckless and need an extraordinary amount of fortune to escape.'

'Well, we have it.'

'Where did you even get it?' Fleur demanded. 'It costs a fortune to buy and the brewing process is incredibly complex. You better not have made another shady deal with a vampire.'

'The new potions professor gave it away as a prize.' He laughed. 'No vampires involved.'

'I don't think you need that potion, monCœur. You seem to be quite lucky as is.'

'I have you.' Harry stepped close and slipped his arms round her waist, pulling her against him. 'I'd say that makes me *very* lucky.'

'It does,' she murmured, nestling her face into his chest.

He held her tight and cradled her head against him. 'I missed you,' Harry whispered. 'I hate this. I can't breathe when you're not with me. I just want the next few months to be done, then I'll be with you. Always.'

A warm glow settled on her cheeks. 'I got very used to you being around over this summer, too.' Fleur leant back in his arms. 'Are we still chasing Rookwood?'

Harry shook his head. 'From what he said, he's not considered in the same league as the others in the inner circle. We should probably go after one of the others.'

'Travers?' Fleur suggested. 'The Lestrange brothers and Dolohov haven't been seen yet, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle are all unlikely, and the Carrows, Nott, Avery, Macnair, and Yaxley are dead.

His gaze sharpened. 'Why Travers?'

She bent and picked the photo of the Lake District off the table. 'The silver mask he's known to wear has been seen frequently with the raids happening on the tiny old magical villages in this part of the country. It's a good chance to grab him.'

'I can't.' Harry's lips twisted. 'I'm stuck talking to Slughorn. I need to butter him up, or I can't take my fourth NEWT early.'

'I will go alone, then.' Fleur held her breath.

He tensed and his grip tightened around her waist. 'No.' 'Yes.'

'*No*.'

She tossed her hair back over her shoulder. 'So we should just wait helplessly for the noose to close?'

He wrestled with her words. 'No --- but---\'

'It's ok, monCœur.' Fleur watched the shadow rise in his

eyes and felt the panic surge within him. She pulled his head down

into her embrace and swallowed her pride. 'I won't fight. I won't even be seen. Does that make it easier?'

Harry released a shaky breath. 'A bit, but can't we just wait?' She held his gaze. 'Can we?'

He closed his eyes, but his body remained taut as a wire. 'No. No, there\'s no time. Voldemort's winning and the Ministry is holed up in Azkaban and London.'

'So I will go. I'll set up a trap so on the next full moon, when we know for sure he's going to be out and wearing his mask, we'll be able to snatch him away somewhere quiet. It's all things I'm better at than you, too.' Fleur ran her fingers through his hair. 'Breathe, monCœur. It will be fine.'

Harry caught her fingers and his ragged breathing

quickened. 'If anything goes wrong. *Anything.'*

She touched a fingertip to the acorn dangling against his chest. 'I will either escape back here and tell you I'm safe, or I will apparate back here and tell you I'm safe.'

'Don't get hurt,' he whispered, a dead, dazed, hollow glint welling up in his eyes. 'If you're gone, there're no dreams left. There'd be *nothing*---'

She pressed her lips to his. 'I'm here. You can feel me, smell me, see me, and taste my kisses. I'm not going anywhere.'

Harry's breathing slowed. 'You smell of marzipan and chocolate.' His faint chuckle vibrated through her. '*As always.*'

She kissed him. 'Besides. You'd still have the other half of your veela harem.'

A quiet laugh burst from his lips. 'I quite like my veela harem as it is, mon Rêve. As much as Gabby jokes about wanting to displace you, she's not you.'

*And she's not the one who'll steal you from me the moment I'm gone.* Fleur smothered a flash of heat. *There's another girl who'd be more than happy to do that.*

'If I get stolen away, Gabby will still have to race Katie Bell

to take my place,' Fleur murmured. 'How has she been? Clingy?'

Harry's lips twisted and he shrugged. 'I'm still not convinced, you know. And it doesn't matter anyway.'

*You will be. You'll see.*

'I know.' Fleur took a deep breath and cupped his chin in her

palm. 'I trust you. I know you.'

He twitched. 'Would you like to hear about my animagus

form?'

'Changing the subject, monCœur?' Fleur teased. 'I hope it's

not a snake, they're cold.'

'No.' Some humour returned to his face and a soft tickle

brushed her arms. 'Now *you* can make bird jokes.'

She glanced down and found little dark feathers along his

arms. Fleur laughed and ran her fingers through them. 'Perfect. They're very cute. What kind of bird is it?'

'A raven.' He closed his eyes for a second and a crown of ebony feathers sprouted through his hair. 'But this is about as far as I can go before I end up going all bird-like.'

'You can't even manage a beak?' Fleur teased.

Harry shot her a grin and the feathers slipped back under his

skin. 'I also don't go sex-crazy, either.'

She pouted at him. 'You need to stop listening to Gabby, monCœur.'

'Really? That's not true?' He let out a little gasp. 'But she said I had to help her with her veela majority or she'd go mad. I *promised.*'

A peal of laughter burst from Fleur's lips. 'I need to hex that little chick, she's growing far too bold with her jokes.' She poked him in the ribs. 'And you ought to not encourage her.'

He kissed her upturned pout. 'But you get so cute when Gabby and I make jokes.'

Fleur smiled, catching sight of the moon through the kitchen

window. 'I must go. And so must you, I suspect.'

'I'm going to be a little late already,' he admitted, cupping her face in his hands and pressing his lips to hers. 'But it's worth it.'

'Of course.' She gave him a small smirk, then plucked her

wand from the table and apparated to the mountainside.

A scatter of lakes spread out beneath the scree slope, like flower petals upon the shining stem winding away toward the sea. Dusk hung over low shrubs, trees, and the rustle of the long grass. Sheep's bleating echoed across the bleak slopes and a faint, cool breeze whispered through the leaves of shrubs.

*Somewhere 'round here, there'll be a raid.* Fleur tightened her grip on her wand and apparated up the slope, scanning the night. *The Dark Mark's hard to miss...* She apparated to the scree-strewn summit.

A skull and snake hung over a flickering orange glow at the far end of one of the lakes.

*There.* She apparated across the scree until she caught a glint of silver high upon the next slope. Fleur narrowed her eyes and peered into the dark until a faint shadow appeared upon the slope, its silver mask flashing in the full moonlight. *Travers.*

'A wasted raid,' Travers muttered, plucking blades of grass and tossing them down the slope. 'Not a single one, just meat for the stinking wolves.'

'Gemino,' Fleur murmured, studying the mask.

A thin piece of silver fell into her hands.

*It will still need all the same enchantments as the old one, as well as my new ones.* She turned it over, checking each of the lines, then disillusioned herself, slipping through the grass toward the Death Eater's silhouette.

Travers hurled a fistful of grass away and sighed, tilting his head back to stare at the moon. 'Such a cold, pale, perfect light.'

'Confundo,' Fleur whispered, and a shiver washed through

Travers.

Fleur reached out and touched the tip of her wand to the

mask, closing her eyes. A thin film of magic coated each side of the silver. Light danced from one to the other like stones skipping across water.

*Good. Just the one enchantment.* She slipped away a safe distance and tucked her copy deep into the grass out of the moonlight.

Travers let out a long sigh and stared down at the smoke and fire spreading through the small village beside the lake. 'At least the beasts will be done soon.'

Fleur froze mid-crouch and wove her magic into the mask, mimicking the prior enchantment, then breaking the silver sections up and threading the pieces of a portkey enchantment in. She duplicated it once more, linking the two masks with the Protean Charm. Her legs throbbed, ached, and cramped as she finished connecting the two pieces of silver. *Now I just need an activation word he'll say within a short time of us activating the portkey.*

'A,' she whispered.

Her calf twinged once more and she bit her lip. *Just cramps.*

*Not even the worst kind.*

Fleur tucked her version of the mask under her arm and

raised her wand. 'Confundo.'

Travers shuddered, his shoulders slumping. She switched her mask with the one on his face with a single spell and apparated back into the kitchen.

Her calf twinged again. *Ah. Annoying.* She bent and massaged it until the feeling faded. *At least I've not had any other cramps in a while.*

Fleur froze. 'Oh *merde*.' She tossed both masks to the floor

and ripped her wand out, pressing its tip to her stomach.

Her magic swirled beneath her skin.

*Nothing but my magic.* A shaky breath left her lips. *It's too early to tell. My magic would cover a child's for another month.* Fleur closed her eyes and tried to stifle the fluttering in her stomach,

pressing her hand to her abdomen. *What will Harry do if I am?* She tried to imagine his reaction, but a thousand different versions of him danced before her eyes, and a girl with dark hair and blue eyes flitted through her thoughts, blurring with flashes of a younger Gabby. *He'd be happy. If we made a baby, then he'd know I'd never disappear. It'd be another part of his perfect wish.* Fleur grimaced and bit her lip. *But he'd also do his absolute utmost to keep me here and safe. And if I tell him and I'm wrong...* Her heart sank. *I'd snatch that dream from him.*

She vanished the original silver mask, placing the charm- linked version on the kitchen table and rummaging through the fridge for something sweet. 'I'll tell you when I know for sure, monCœur.' Fleur tugged a thin slice of lemon tart out and bit off the tip. 'Pardon.' She swallowed the sharp, sweet lemon and crumbling pastry and sighed. 'I don't want to give you another wish only to steal it away.'

# The White Bumblebee

Harry watched Snape drift about within his office holding a glass of blackberry wine and tucked Dumbledore's note into his pocket. A cauldron spilt thick, white mist over the bench at the back of the office, giving off a thick tang of juniper.

*He dances between Voldemort and Dumbledore so well they both think he's their man.* Harry stacked the books Snape had leant him onto the bench. *And now here he is helping me. But he's no more loyal to me than them.*

A web of threads tightened around him in the eye of his mind. The classroom walls closed in until his breath caught.

*I need to get out of here. Before Dumbledore, or Snape, or Voldemort, or someone manages to catch me and keep me from Fleur.*

\'You\'re still here,\' Snape drawled. \'I expected you to go to the headmaster immediately.\'

\'I will in a moment,\' Harry said. \'I was curious about the Dark

Mark.\'

\'I presume you want to know how it works?\' Snape bared

his left forearm.

\'I do.\' Harry leant close, pressing the tip of his wand into it.

The Dark Mark squirmed, the snake writhing through the skull, tongue flickering, scales rippling, and fangs agape. Snape hissed and snatched his arm back. Pure fury flashed in his dark eyes, then his face turned hard and unreadable.

sleeve.

\'How curious,\' Harry mused, slipping his wand back into his

\'It allows the Dark Lord to summon us, giving us a glimpse

of his location so we might apparate to his side, but it also symbolises an oath of fealty to him, a magical promise.' Snape pulled his sleeve back down. \'I studied it in great detail. As long as I still serve him and carry out his commands, then I haven't broken it, even if I serve another, or myself, as well.\'

\'What happens if you break it?\' Harry asked.

\'It was made by the Dark Lord, Harry,\' Snape drawled. \'He is not known for mercy, nor compassion, what do you *think* happens if he learns I have?\'

\'Death.'

*You can't repeat your mistakes. If you can't trust them, you shouldn't wait around to be stabbed in the back.*

\'Death.\' Snape sipped his wine. \'I have to carefully avoid any commands that might clash with Dumbledore\'s goals. Fortunately, as the Dark Lord believes I am *his* spy, he gives me some leeway.\'

\'What happens if you *are* given an order?\'

\'I must carry it out, no matter the command. Of course, I tell Dumbledore first, and he decides if I ought to obey completely or try to... *re-interpret* it.'

*So that\'s what happened with Katie*. *Voldemort commanded.* Harry smothered the ball of ice tightening in his chest. *And Dumbledore decided she wasn't worth saving.*

\'I have a little leeway,\' Snape said. \'I can interpret his orders in a certain way, but sometimes things are simply black and white, or yes or no.\'

\'Perhaps you should forget to learn the addresses of the students in future,\' Harry suggested.

Snape\'s eyes jerked up from his goblet.

Harry held his gaze. \'I imagine that there're those who are less understanding of your situation, particularly if someone they cared about was hurt, *or killed,* because you gave away a location for Voldemort to attack.\'

\'If I said I was sorry, it wouldn't change anything.\'

*Pure apathy. How many others has he given up to die? Did he stop caring after he did it to my parents? Or did it take longer?*

\'No, I don\'t suppose it would,' Harry murmured.

\'Number fourteen, South Street, Diagon Alley,\' Snape muttered.

*Katie's address.* Harry forced his fury down.

\'That would be a good address to forget,\' he said.

\'The Dark Lord knows it now,\' Snape said. \'It would be best if Katherine Bell does not return there. He is insistent that she be taken from you, though I am unsure as to why she is so important.\'

*Because he knows we're similar. The horcrux in the diary knew it too.* Harry pushed the books back across the desk with a faint smile. *And he wants to see what will happen. For whatever reason, he sacrificed everything. He wants to see if I will. He wants to see what I'll become when there're no dreams left.*

replied.

\'I should go see the headmaster,\' Harry said.

\'I suspect he has many important things to tell you,\' Snape

*Does he?* Harry hurried through the halls, skirting a pair of

ghosts. *Did he find a horcrux over the summer while he was off hunting?* A small smile spread over his lips. *If he has, then Fleur and I are only a couple of steps away from our sunset. And the next time Voldemort's Killing Curse reflects off a baby will be his last.*

A quiet shuffle echoed from the corridor behind him. Harry whirled, wand in hand, and tongue taut with incantations.

Hermione crept from the shadows, pale-faced, with burst veins in her eyes and deep bags beneath them. Her gaze fixed itself on the tip of his wand and she chewed at her lip.

*She's really not sleeping well.* A faint pang of pity bit at him.

*Bad dreams are nothing compared to having all your hopes torn*

*away. She'll be fine.*

\'What are you doing out of Gryffindor Tower at this time?\' Harry asked, tucking his wand away.

Hermione sagged. \'I could ask you the same thing,\' she said.

*\'I\'m* a prefect---\' she tapped the red and gold badge \'---*you're* not.\'

\'And I would tell you that I have been talking with Snape, who told me that I should go and see Professor Dumbledore immediately.\' He studied her expression. 'I suspect, from the way you were creeping around, that you're not on patrol.'

\'I was following Malfoy,\' Hermione muttered. \'Ron reckons he\'s seen him clutching his arm a couple of times, so when I saw him

slinking about in the evening, I decided to keep an eye on him. I caught sight of you afterward.\'

\'And you decided to follow me instead of Malfoy?\'

\'I was about to ask you what you were doing out of the tower,\' Hermione retorted. \'But you caught me by surprise before I could.\'

*Sure.*

\'Any idea what Malfoy was doing?\' Harry asked. 'If he's

rubbing his *forearm...'*

\'He was skulking around the potions labs and Professor Slughorn\'s office.\' Hermione bit her lip. \'I think he was looking for the rest of the felixfelicis.\'

\'There are a *lot* of poisonous things down there,\' Harry said.

'He's probably going to end up poisoning himself.'

Hermione smiled and for a brief instant the dark bruises beneath her eyes seemed to lighten. \'I can\'t be too careful, though,' she muttered. \'What if he really is a Death Eater and up to something?\'

\'He\'s our age and fairly useless.\' Harry shrugged. \'If Voldemort's given him something to do, it\'s more than likely he\'s meant to be passing information on Dumbledore or me. Worrying about having to hurt him because he\'s secretly an assassin for Voldemort is a bit paranoid.\'

\'It\'s only paranoia if I\'m wrong,\' Hermione snapped.

\'You've been wrong before,\' Harry said. 'I remember it quite

well.'

She flinched. 'I wasn't *wrong.'* Hermione crossed her arms. 'I

just made a mistake.'

'Well, try not to make another one,' he suggested. 'Murdering Malfoy because you thought him stealing potions ingredients was part of some plot to assassinate Dumbledore isn't going to look good on your Head Girl application.'

Hermione huffed and balled her fists. 'I'm not going to murder anyone! You can't joke about things like that.'

'Sounds like something a murderer would say,' Harry

quipped.

breath.

She whirled on her heel and stalked off, muttering under her

He listened to her footsteps fade, then continued on his way

toward the gargoyle. \'Sherbet Lemon,\' he commanded.

The gargoyle stepped aside to reveal the small, spiral stairs. Harry took a deep breath, clearing his thoughts, then made his way up.

\'Come in, Harry,\' Dumbledore called.

\'Professor Dumbledore.\' He dipped his head, crossing the room to stand next to a trilling Fawkes.

\'Take a seat.\' Dumbledore conjured a comfortable-looking armchair behind him and peered at him over steepled, bright- coloured, gloved fingers. \'We have much to discuss.\'

'We always seem to,' Harry replied.

\'How was your summer, Harry?\'

\'Liberating.\' Harry\'s lips twitched as he fought to keep the smile from his face.

\'We were most concerned about you, Harry,\' Dumbledore chided. 'You promised to stay where you were safest, then you vanished at a time when you must've known what we would've fear.'

\'I kept my promise, sir. I spent the summer where I was

safest.\'

\'Your aunt and uncle, while not the most pleasant or polite

of people, were of your blood, and the wards there kept you far safer than anything else you might find.\'

\'Even the Fidelius?\' Harry asked.

\'You can cast it?\' Dumbledore\'s eyes twinkled. 'That is most impressive. Very few would be able to cast such a piece of magic at your age.' His bright blue eyes sharpened. 'Or even, perhaps, were they a couple of years older.'

*No doubt the Weasleys went running right to him.*

\'No,\' Harry admitted.

\'Miss Delacour, then.'

Harry nodded, not trusting his tongue.

'I can understand your actions, Harry, but I fear you've not

fully thought through the consequences of them.\'

\'I disagree, sir.'

\'Allow me to elucidate.\' Dumbledore placed his palms flat upon the desk.

*You can try.* Harry studied the rainbow-patterned stripes on the gloves. *But nothing you say or do will ever make me want to leave Fleur for so much as a second.*

'Your aunt and uncle, while no doubt happier without you, or any memory of magic---\' the twinkle faded from Dumbledore\'s eyes '---were safe only as long as Tom never targeted them. I suspect he will not, since you are neither very fond of them, nor will they know anything useful, but it is hard to be certain.\'

\'I don't think he even knows they exist, sir,\' Harry replied. \'If someone had let slip my location, then he would've surely tried to get to me during the summer. Blood wards tied to my mother's magic feel like a very flimsy shield after watching him use my blood to resurrect himself.\'

\'Perhaps, though I would be inclined to trust in the power of your mother's love, Harry,\' Dumbledore said, running a gloved hand through his beard. \'Your decision to vanish, however, was most ill- advised, even if spending the summer in the company of Miss Delacour must have seemed irresistible.\'

*I've never been happier.* Harry smothered his rage. *Of course you don't like the idea. How inconvenient for your sacrifice to finally find something to live for.*

\'She is a lot more attractive than Dudley,\' he said.

\'True as that may be, Harry, there are few protections that Tom cannot penetrate, for, despite his many failings, he remains a brilliant wizard.\'

\'He can't penetrate what he can\'t find,\' Harry said. \'And should he have found us, we would be gone long before he passed through the rest of our wards.\'

\'There was more than the Fidelius Charm?\' Dumbledore leant forward, his eyes rapier sharp.

\'Of course. I know better than most that the Fidelius is not foolproof.\'

\'Miss Delacour is supremely talented. It's not often that we're able to find someone so well matched to ourselves.\'

*Perfect. As she always is.* A little smile crept onto his lips.

*And doesn't she know it.*

Harry cocked his head and admired Fawkes' plumage. \'Voldemort couldn't have found us without finding our secret keeper, nor could he have penetrated our wards without alerting us in time for us to escape, we were quite safe.\'

\'It is your choice of secret keeper that concerns me, Harry,\' Dumbledore said. \'Sirius may be your godfather, but he can be quite rash. I would prefer it, since you seem set on staying there, that you allowed me to keep your secret instead. I let your parents choose Sirius, and then secretly Peter Pettigrew, but I have no wish to see the past repeat itself if I can avoid it.\'

*Unless it involves another person sacrificing their life to destroy Voldemort*.

\'Sirius almost never leaves the headquarters of the Order, which are also under the Fidelius, making him almost the ideal secret keeper,\' Harry said. 'However, I suspect now the tide of war is turning against us, that you can't afford to keep him hidden. You'll need every able wand when Voldemort finally storms Azkaban.'

\'He is not your secret keeper, is he?\' Dumbledore murmured.

*Merde.* Harry bit his tongue.

\'No, he isn't.\'

\'Am I able to persuade you that I will make a more cautious choice of secret keeper?\' Dumbledore asked.

\'I\'m afraid not, sir,\' Harry said. \'You're a target for Voldemort and his followers. Should you die, my protections will unravel. The current secret keeper will never even have to witness the war; their connection to me isn't even known by most.\'

\'I shall have to hope that you are right, Harry,\' Dumbledore said. \'I daresay I will find you equally adamant on remaining in the company of the charming Miss Delacour, so I will keep my concerns about her safety at your side to myself.\'

\'Wise of you,\' Harry muttered.

*Although no doubt you will attempt to drive a wedge between your sacrifice and anything not entirely selfless.*

\'Alas, wisdom is one of the few benefits of age.\' Dumbledore sighed, removing the left glove to reveal a slender band of gold set with a dark stone. \'Yet it is one I have ignored all too frequently.\' He removed the right glove, revealing shrivelled, blackened flesh that'd retreated back to the bone, leaving veins and tendons prominent beneath stretched, thin skin.

*The withering curse. Mid-stage*. *How is he alive?*

\'What happened?\' he asked.

\'You're aware of the curse I have contracted, I believe,\'

Dumbledore chided.

'I meant how did you contract it?\'

\'Ah, a moment of rashness on my part.\' Dumbledore adjusted his glasses with his uninjured hand. \'Tell me, Harry, have you ever wondered just *how* Tom survived the reflected Killing Curse on that night all those years ago?\'

\'The question had crossed my mind,\' Harry said.

*So it's finally time*. *Is he just going to tell me they exist, or does he hope telling me that I'm a horcrux will rip me from Fleur and convince me to sacrifice myself for all these selfish little people.*

\'Allow me to explain the mystery, then.\' Dumbledore stroked Fawkes with his left hand, burying his fingers in the phoenix\'s splendid plumage. \'There's a branch of magic known as soul magic that either relies on the concept, or actually interacts with, the soul of a being.'

\'The Killing Curse,\' Harry said.

\'Yes, that is a product of this branch of magic.\' Dumbledore\'s lips thinned. \'While relying on the concept has produced many fine and useful pieces of magic, interacting with the soul *directly* has produced very few spells that should be remembered.\'

*All the best bits of magic are abstract magic.* Harry studied the books over Dumbledore's shoulder. *I wonder if he knows something Salazar and I didn't work out?*

\'Sorry, sir, but what exactly is a soul?\' he asked.

\'Ah.' Dumbledore beamed. \'A very good question. The soul is not something we have ever been able to quantify with any certainty. It is considered, by those who study the deepest, more complex mysteries of magic, to be a sort of fusion of sentience and purpose, fuelled by our magic. Regardless of its exact nature, it seems that it's essential for true life. The Killing Curse tears it from

the body of its victim and the Dementor\'s kiss steals all but the faintest imprint of it.\'

\'If the Killing Curse tears away the soul. How did Voldemort

survive?\'

\'The short answer is that he did not, not truly.\' Dumbledore

sighed. \'The magic of your mother\'s sacrifice was stronger than anything I've seen before or since. There was nothing left of Voldemort in that room. His body was utterly destroyed. His spirit, however, his *soul,* endured. This is a complex topic, Harry, but I will attempt to summarise it as succinctly as I am able. A soul torn from a body cannot survive without some form of an anchor, like a word spoken into the wind, it will swiftly be scattered by the emotion and intent in the magic around it.\' He steepled his fingers, matching withered dead fingertips with wrinkled live ones. 'Ghosts are, by my estimation, souls magically anchored by strong regret in the moment of their death. This is a strong emotion, enough to anchor them, but regret is a weak purpose, so often little more than a powerless imprint remains.'

'Voldemort's definitely not a ghost.'

'Indeed he is not. There's a particularly dark piece of magic capable of fragmenting a wizard or witch\'s soul, in a sense, then binding it to something. While that artefact exists, the soul, the sentience and purpose of that individual, remains strongly tethered to this world. I must admit, Harry, that I am hypothesising here, but I suspect the precious nature of the artefact used and the intention of the magic required to create it results in such a strong anchor that the caster may find a way to return.\'

\'So Voldemort has one of these objects,\' Harry said.

\'More than one, I believe.\' Dumbledore slid open the drawer to his desk and placed the battered, fang-riven form of the diary upon

its smooth surface. \'The memory of Tom Riddle you destroyed in your second year was likely far more than a memory.\'

\'You knew? You knew what this was and you didn\'t tell me?\' \'You were twelve, Harry, would you have understood?\'

Dumbledore's shoulders sagged. 'Did I even have the right to make

you understand at that age?'

\'I certainly would have been old enough to understand before now,\' Harry retorted.

\'It is dangerous knowledge,\' Dumbledore murmured. \'Professor Slughorn has returned to this school to escape Tom, whom he realises will not let him live knowing the secret of his immortality.\'

\'I suspect he will not let me live, either. He seems rather

intent on me dying.'

\'There're worse things than death, Harry.\' A gentle smile hovered beneath Dumbledore's bright blue eyes. 'It terrifies the young, who instinctively assume they have many years to come, but it's no more than peaceful sleep.'

*No. You don't know that.* Harry stifled a twist of emotion as it writhed in his gut. *It could be endless emptiness, a hungry, hollow void. And even if it's not, it's a thief, come to steal us from our dreams, or our dreams from us.*

\'This diary is not the only such object, or horcrux, I have encountered.' Dumbledore rested his finger upon the dark stone set in his ring. \'This ring was an heirloom of the family from whom Tom is descended and that heritage is something he places great value on.\'

\'So it has a piece of his soul in it?' Harry eyed it and hid a smile. 'Is it safe?'

*It seems very tame compared to the diadem or the diary.* His gaze dropped to Dumbledore's withered hand. *Unless that curse is the price Dumbledore paid for destroying it.*

\'Not anymore,\' Dumbledore said.

\'So he's mortal now.'

*The diary. The diadem. The ring.* A brief flare of triumph rose within him. *He is mortal.*

\'I suspect Tom may have made more. He'd quite an interest in many fields of magic. I suspect, given the nature of those, that he intended to create a ritual from all the pieces of magic cast to create horcruxes, and thus made a specific number of them.\' Dumbledore slipped his gloves back on. \'I think that is enough on this particular topic for now, Harry. If you wish, and I would certainly encourage it, you may join me to learn more about Tom. I have collected a series of memories from those who have encountered him, gradually piecing together the story of his life. I hope to use them to locate and destroy his horcruxes, but I may have need of your assistance.\'

\'Do you really think a few memories will provide the locations?\' Harry asked.

\'I have spent thirteen years searching for these specific memories, Harry,\' Dumbledore said. \'And I found many more beside them. They are not passing recollections, but ones of great relevance and import. For all his brilliance, Tom never truly shed the impulses and desires of the ambitious, dangerous boy I met almost half a century ago. His hubris will not allow him to place his horcruxes in locations that don't hold great meaning to him.\'

*Of course.* The quiet of the Chamber of Secrets, the willow

tree beside the river in France, and Fleur's smile hovered in Harry's

thoughts. *Something that precious can't be entrusted to just anywhere.*

\'I would be happy to assist you,\' Harry said. 'They need to be destroyed.'

\'Thank you, Harry.' Dumbledore rummaged through his bowl of sweets and slipped a pear drop into his mouth. \'Now, onto more cheerful things, I have heard from Professor McGonagall that you make a handsome raven?\'

\'Only very briefly,\' Harry said. \'I managed to transfigure myself into a raven, as the most fitting form, but it was no animagus transformation. I was the raven, but the raven was not me.\'

\'An interesting way of putting it. It takes a great deal of thought and effort to truly have the raven become you, as you so eloquently put it.\'

\'You aren't an animagus, are you?\' Harry asked.

\'No, though Aberforth, my brother, insists that I will be a particularly feminine sphinx. It has to do with my penchant for speaking in riddles, I believe.\'

Harry chuckled, then remembered the sphinx in the maze and fell quiet. \'Is it possible to take the form of a magical creature?\'

\'No.\' Dumbledore shook his head. \'While there are magical animals that may suit our characters, most magical creatures possess qualities that humans do not. Frequently, they're capable of natural forms of alchemy, Fawkes' rebirth is such a thing, and thus are never similar enough to be an animagus\' form.\'

Harry relaxed. *At least the sphinx isn't something sinister,*

*then.*

\'I must admit, Harry, that I actually do know the form best suited to me.\' Dumbledore smiled and Fawkes trilled with amusement. \'You must promise to never tell my brother, but were I to ever attempt to become an animagus, I would become a most handsome bumblebee.\'

Harry blinked. Dumbledore caught his eyes and fragmented images of a large bee with stripes of yellow so bright it seemed almost white, flitted through his thoughts.

\'A very handsome bee,\' Harry said, breaking the connection between their thoughts. \'And I promise not to tell your brother, either.\'

\'Thank you, Harry. Aberforth would never let me hear the end of it. He likes to ensure that, despite my not so modest accomplishments, my feet remain firmly on the ground. I suppose that it is a good thing he continues to remind me of my mistakes, I daresay I might have made more had he not.\'

*You made enough as it is.* Harry flinched from the chime of the clock behind him and Fawkes twitched upon his perch.

Dumbledore glanced over Harry\'s shoulder. \'Ah, it's grown later than I thought, Harry. You should be off to bed, if not for your sake, then for mine. You will find, when you are as old as I am, that you will need a great deal of sleep.\'

*Only, you don't intend for me to get much older than I already am, do you?* Harry buried the thought and the tangle of feeling behind a faint smile.

\'Goodnight, sir,' he said.

# Hindsight

A comical drawing marked the page beneath his fingers: a small, childlike form under a tattered sheet. Harry let himself recall the grey flesh and gaping maw that lay beneath with a soft chill and a prickle down his spine.

\'I will assume, since you have been given ample time, that you have read the chapter on lethifolds, specifically Dementors,\' Snape drawled. \'So if I see any books still open I will be... *displeased*.\'

Almost every book in the class snapped shut.

\'Mr Malfoy and Miss Granger.' Snape's eyes flashed \'Do you somehow think yourselves above my instruction?\'

Hermione closed her book with a quiet, irritated sniff and Malfoy\'s shut with a sullen thump, flopping over the edge of the desk and thudding to the floor. Snape\'s lip curled.

*Let's see how important being on my good side is to you?*

Harry shot him a beatific smile and left his book open on the desk.

Snape turned away.

*Nice to know.*

\'Did Snape just pass up another opportunity to take points away from you?\' Nev whispered.

'I suspect Dumbledore may have instructed him to curb his enthusiasm toward my detention tally.\'

'Why?\'

\'He's a part of the Order of the Phoenix, a spy for

Dumbledore amongst Voldemort\'s ranks.\' \'That\'s brave of him,\' Nev murmured.

\'It\'s only bravery if you're risking something,\' Harry replied. \'Snape only risks others.\'

\'Still. To face and lie to Voldemort every time, knowing that each time he is summoned might be his last...' Nev shrugged. 'That requires a fair bit of courage.'

\'He doesn't lie to Voldemort,\' Harry said. \'Snape is more a servant of two masters than a spy. He does whatever he is ordered by either and does his best to destroy Voldemort for his own reasons rather than the betterment of Britain.\' He fell silent as Snape swept past the back of the class to destroy the small paper Dementor Pansy Parkinson had charmed to spew ink over Hermione\'s notes.

\'That sounds much less brave,\' Nev said.

\'Bravery is the prerogative of the blind,\' Snape dawled from two feet over Nev\'s head. \'Being brave does not mean that you will *win*, Mr Longbottom. Of all the people in this class, you should know that best.\'

Nev\'s fists balled on the top of the desk and Harry put a hand on his shoulder.

\'Granger.\' Snape turned away with a sneer. \'You\'re likely to know the answers, no doubt you\'ve already devoured this textbook. How would you repel a Dementor?\'

\'The Patronus Charm,\' Hermione said.

\'I said how would *you* repel it, Granger,\' Snape said. \'Are you capable of casting the charm?\'

\'Yes.\' Hermione beamed. \'Harry taught some of us how to

do it.\'

\'Did he now?\' Snape murmured, fixing Harry with an

irritated stare.

*Ah*. *I\'ve ruined your lesson plan, haven\'t I? Well, Nev and the DA have.*

\'Well, then.\' Snape swept back to the front of the class. \'Perhaps we shall test Mr Potter\'s teaching prowess. Let\'s go around the class and see who can produce anything of a true patronus. Mr Malfoy, perhaps you would be so kind as to go first.\'

\'Potter managed it years ago.\' Malfoy sneered. \'It can\'t be hard.\' He pushed himself out of his chair, standing tall and proud in front of the class. \'ExpectoPatronum,\' he whispered.

A rush of silver mist swirled from his wand into a bright hippogriff that snorted and champed, pawing at the ground.

*A hippogriff. Really?* Harry chuckled to himself. *That's the*

*form of his positive emotions?*

\'Very good, Mr Malfoy,\' Snape said. \'What memory did you

use?\'

\'That\'s none of your business, \' Malfoy said, sitting down. \'I

said it wasn\'t hard.'

\'Continue down the rows,\' Snape instructed. \'For those of you like Mr Malfoy, who has been trying since third year, I expect to see a similar result.\'

Malfoy scowled and stared up at the ceiling.

A succession of small bursts of silver mist made their way across the desks toward the back where Nev and Harry sat, interspersed with the occasional creature from those he'd taught in the Room of Requirement. A lean, lithe mountain lion growled around Ron\'s waist before fading from the room, much to Hermione\'s pride.

*They've actually all managed to get pretty close to casting*

*it.*

\'Miss Granger,\' Snape prompted. \'You're taking a long time,

for someone who sounded so confident.\'

Hermione raised her wand, chewing at her lip. \'Expectopatronum,\' she muttered.

A bright, four-winged moth hovered above her head, rubbing its legs against its head, fluttering its wings. The class\'s eyes moved on to the next in line.

*A moth. Death. Despair. Salazar's last patronus was a moth.* Harry studied the moth. *Interesting. Are her nightmares so bad she's struggling to hold onto her positive emotions?*

Nev\'s silver wolf sat on its haunches upon the desk.

\'Ah,\' Snape drawled. \'Now for the main event, Mr Potter?\' \'Everyone has already seen mine back in third year.\'

\'Then you won\'t mind demonstrating once more.\' Snape's eyes gleamed. 'Don't be shy, Mr Potter, you're a celebrity, remember.'

\'But you\'re the professor, sir.\' Harry smiled. \'Surely you should be the one demonstrating? Unless... for some reason, you can't?\'

*Some reason like being an apathetic shell of a man.*

The class held its breath.

\'Expectopatronum,\' Snape spat and a brilliant, silver doe leapt from his wand to spring around the room.

*How dare he?* Harry's breath caught on the fist of ice clamped around his heart. Its chill coursed through his veins with each shuddering beat . *He loved her. He loved her like I love Fleur. And he betrayed her.* His stomach churned, flashing hot and cold, writhing like a barrel of snakes. Harry swallowed bile. *How dare he ruin something perfect?!*

\'Expectopatronum,\' he hissed.

The towering anzu dispersed Nev\'s wolf with one taloned foot, spreading its wings in a flash of silver light that shattered every other surviving patronus in the room. Snape\'s doe burst apart, collapsing like a punctured cloud, and Hermione\'s moth scattered into mist. Silence hung over the class.

\'Anzu,\' Hermione murmured. \'They\'re an extinct magical eagle of Mesopotamia associated with fire, enthrallment, and destruction.\'

\'Thank you, Miss Granger,\' Snape drawled. \'You do not have to recite the dictionary definition of everything you come across.\'

*The damage is already done*, *but they never would've*

*understood the truth anyway.*

Hermione stared at the anzu with a dark expression and gnawed her lip so deep blood smeared her teeth. Harry banished it, and the anzu vanished with a soft, ominous screech.

\'I think that will be all for today,\' Snape said. \'Mr Potter, it appears, has already taught this class. If you would be so kind as to stay behind, Mr Potter, so I can discover if there are any of my *other* classes that I no longer need to teach.\'

\'Have fun,\' Nev murmured on his way out.

\'You dislike the form of my patronus,\' Snape said, as the last of the students left.

\'I do. It shows exactly what it was you ruined when you betrayed her.\'

Snape flinched. \'Then you hate it almost as much as I both love and loathe it.\'

\'I trust you asked me to stay behind for something more than discussing your patronus?\' Harry asked.

\'I wanted to know if the rumours I\'ve heard about you and Beauxbatons\'s former Triwizard Champion are true, but there seems little point in asking now.\'

\'There would have been little point in asking before,\' Harry

retorted. '*I've* no intention of betraying her.'

The corner of Snape's mouth crooked and he ushered Harry into his office. \'How is your attempt to sway Professor Slughorn going?\'

\'He intends to assess my progress over the next few weeks, I suspect, so I have until about Christmas to convince him.\'

*A scatter of gifts, a handful of reminders of my mother and of Riddle, and Slughorn will be happily supporting me for one reason or another.* Harry inspected the interior of Snape's office out of the

corner of his eye. *I just need to make sure Snape continues to help me progress.*

Snape watched him with a soft gleam to his eyes. \'What?\' Harry demanded.

\'There are times when you look very much like your mother,\' Snape said. \'Whenever you finally decide to use your brain you get the same glint in your eyes that she used to.\'

A bright point of cold welled up over Harry\'s heart. 'Perhaps if you were so fond of her, you shouldn't have got her killed.'

Snape winced. 'I did not know,' he murmured. 'I told him

*before* I knew.'

*And look what happened. She was killed. And I was left to be nothing for over a decade.*

Harry turned away from Snape before he lost control of his temper. \'What\'re you brewing?\'

The same small cauldron rested on Snape\'s desk, spewing thick, white mist across the desk and floor. The scent of mistletoe berries, salamander\'s blood, and juniper drifted to Harry;s nose.

\'A potion to arrest the effects of the headmaster\'s most recent act of foolishness,\' Snape said. 'It keeps the curse he contracted at bay.'

*So that\'s how he's survived*. Harry\'s breath caught. *If Snape dies, then Dumbledore probably dies too. I'd be half-free!* His wand slipped into his hand.

Snape peered down into the cauldron. 'I've almost brewed enough of this to keep Dumbledore going for a few months.' He

wafted white mist away and tossed in a handful of white berries. 'By the time you've convinced Slughorn and taken your NEWTs, he should have ample supply.'

*Not free.* Harry ground his teeth and slid his wand away. *I need my NEWTs.*

'I should head back to the common room,\' Harry said. 'Have a good evening,\' Snape replied

'Thank you.'

He hurried back to the common room and gave the password to the Fat Lady.

\'\... you\'re coming, Ron!\' Hermione yelled as it swung open. The Fat Lady winced. \'That one was much quieter last year.

Spent less time sneaking about the castle after hours too.\'

\'Don\'t blame me.\' Harry raised his hands at her accusing stare. \'I\'m not involved.\'

\'You\'re always involved.\' She sniffed. \'Sirius Black was after

*you* when I was so violently assaulted.\'

\'He was after Peter Pettigrew, actually,\' Harry said. \'Turned out to be a nice chap in the end.\'

The Fat Lady eyed him as if he'd gone mad, but swung the rest of the way aside. Harry strolled through, following the sound of commotion.

\'I don\'t want to go to your stupid party,\' Ron gritted. \'I have no obligation to go when I could better spend my time here studying.\'

Hermione threw her hands up in the air. \'You can\'t study all the time, Ron.\'

\'Hark,\' Nev whispered. 'You are black, says the pot to the

kettle.\'

\'What\'s so great about this party anyway?\' Ron demanded.

'Slug Club rubbish? Is this another crush like you had on Lockhart?'

Hermione went crimson. \'Professor Slughorn is hosting a small gathering for students he thinks have the potential to go far, and I, having been invited, need a date.\'

Katie cackled from near the fireplace. 'Calm down over there Roneo and Hermiet.'

\'A date.\' Ron's ears went red. \'Well why didn\'t you just say

so? Ridiculous girl.\'

\'So you\'re coming?\' Hermione asked.

\'Yes.\' Ron sighed. \'But you really need to work on how you ask guys to go with you to things. Even I was never that bad.'

Someone coughed something that sounded a lot like *Fleur Delacour* and Ron went red again, brightening further still when he caught sight of Harry.

\'Why're you laughing, Harry?\' Nev called. \'You\'re invited too and you don\'t have a date either.\'

\'Merde,\' Harry swore.

\'I think I saw Romilda in the library,\' Nev offered.

\'I *will* curse you.\' Harry glanced around the room, noting the careful disinterest of a lot of the girls. \'I suppose there is only one thing for it. Nev, would you accompany me to the party?\'

Nev sputtered. \'I don\'t think Hannah would approve, but I will ask her.\'

\'Has anyone seen Neville\'s cactus?\' Harry called.

\'You still don\'t have a date.' Romilda Vane flounced across the room. 'But you can take me.'

Harry shot Nev a glare. *I thought you said she was in the*

*library.*

\'Yes he does,\' Katie piped up, rising from her chair beside the

fire. \'I will take pity on you, Harry.'

\'I\'m sure Harry can make up his own mind,\' Romilda said.

A fair few disappeared toward the dormitory, babbling excuses. Nev made to sneak past, but Harry cast a sticking charm on his chair.

\'You\'re responsible for this,\' he muttered. \'You\'re going nowhere and I\'m going to encourage Katie to ask Luna to ask you all sorts of things now.\'

Nev blanched, then grinned. \'You have to survive tonight, first. If Katie doesn\'t get you, Fleur will.\'

An uncomfortable knot of heat twisted in Harry\'s stomach.

*I've a nasty feeling you might be right, Nev.* He tried to smother Fleur's words, but they rose up in the back of his head regardless. *She loves you, but she wants you to be happy. You'll see. At some point, she won't be able to resist.*

A spell burst in brilliant red sparks against the fireplace, then Katie slapped Romilda's wand out of her hand, sending it bouncing across the floor.

\'Go to bed, Romilda,\' Katie snapped. \'Buy a uniform that fits, wash your face, and do the buttons up on your blouse for once. Harry likes his girls a bit older.\' She turned and winked at him.

Harry plastered a smile across his face. *I hope you mean*

*Fleur...*

Romilda threw one last smile at Harry as she bent down to

pick her wand up, making no attempt to keep her skirt from riding up. Katie growled and she fled up the stairs.

\'So, have you asked Hannah yet, Nev? I need a date and Katie\'s scared away your competition.\'

Ron came back down, wearing smarter dress robes than he had managed for the Yule Ball. He let out a loud sigh. 'Oh, good, no Romilda. That girl's a bloody menace.'

\'Take Katie.\' Nev shrugged. \'She\'s not going to throw herself at you like Romilda, and she\'s not terrible company.\'

\'I suppose I could.' Harry shot her a look out of the corner of his eye. 'But she has to promise to be good. No Dark Ladying.'

\'I need to find a dress.\' Katie flapped her hands in the air. \'I am not prepared for this.\'

\'Just transfigure something,\' Harry suggested, changing his robes into the same style as he had worn to the Yule Ball.

\'No!\' Katie darted up the stairs to the girls' dormitories.

\'Will Fleur mind?\' Ron asked.

Nev snorted. 'I---\'

\'I don\'t think so,' Harry said.

*I\'m dead*. *She'll be furious.* Panic clamped its fist about his heart. Harry shoved it down. *No. No she won't. She'll understand.*

Hermione descended the stairs. No bags hung under her eyes and her teal dress robes plunged low enough to show off a slim silver chain dangling in her cleavage. Ron gaped and turned red in the face.

Harry dragged his eyes away from the pair of them. *They're*

*going to give me nightmares if I think about them too much.*

\'Who\'s Harry going with?\' Hermione asked.

\'Katie.\' Nev squirmed on his chair. \'Harry\... Come on, let me

go.\'

her?\'

Hermione pursed her lips. \'That\'s good; when did you ask

\'He didn\'t.' Nev grinned. \'Katie was protecting him from

Romilda Vane.\'

\'Oh.\' Hermione sounded about as convinced as Harry felt. \'I\'m ready.\' Katie bounced down the stairs; her hair scattered

over a dark green, close-fitting dress. 'Do I look okay, Harry?'

'You look great,' he said. 'But you could go a bit more gothic and Dark Lady. Don't want your minions to think you're soft.'

\'You just had that dress lying around, did you?\' Hermione

asked.

\'Yes.\' Katie beamed and grabbed Harry's arm, looping hers through his. \'Just in case.\' She leant on to her toes. 'And guess what I'm not wearing underneath, Harry.' Her breath washed across his cheek with a faint scent of Firewhiskey. 'No seashell bra. No bra at *all.*'

*I shouldn\'t have let Fleur tell me*. He cast one more look at the emerald dress. *Ignorance was bliss.*

\'We should go,\' Harry suggested. 'Or McLaggen will eat all the best food.'

Hermione rolled her eyes. 'You'll be fine with him. He only eats meat and carbs. It's the Greengrass sisters you had to all but physically wrestle for the ice cream last time. I think Astoria was about five seconds away from stabbing you with her spoon.'

'The two pretty, blonde girls in Slytherin?' Katie's grip on his arm tightened. 'What is it with you and sweet-toothed blondes, Harry? Do I need to dye my hair?'

'Well, you eat enough alcoholic chocolates to have the sweet-tooth part covered,' Harry replied. 'So I guess that's the only difference.'

'So unfair.' She pouted and tugged him toward the exit. 'You know, I heard they're both kind of cold-hearted, though.'

Hermione and Ron trailed them, whispering to one another.

Harry raised his finger. 'One, I've barely spoken more than three words to either of them, it's not like we've been secret friends for years. Two, I'm fairly sure the whole cold-hearted thing was just because they ate that entire bowl of giant ice-cream.' He sighed. 'I can't believe I lost the tug of war over the ice cream to a girl half my size.'

Katie snorted. 'What flavour was it?' 'Chocolate chip. And pistachio.' 'Urgh, together?'

Harry shook his head. 'No. Well, not to begin with. *They*

mixed it together.'

'That's just... *why?'* Katie bounced over the trick step and toward Slughorn's lab. 'They're not even great flavours. Rum and raisin is better.'

'Maybe they're not budding alcoholics.'

'I'm not budding,' Katie retorted. 'I'm fully flowered.' 'Yeah, a rose in a garden of empty whiskey bottles,' Harry

quipped.

her feet.

'A rosé by any other name.' Katie giggled and stumbled over

Hermione and Ron skirted around them.

Harry chuckled. 'A rosé too many by the looks of things.'

Katie leant on his arm and beamed at him as they entered a

room scattered with aperitif-laden small tables and bottles of elven wine.

\'Aha,\' Slughorn cried. \'Hermione! And you must be Ronald!

Come in, come in, and help yourself to an aperitif. The p*â*té is delightful and I\'m sure I saw something a little healthier floating around for those not already lost down the path to temptation.\'

\'Thank you.\' Hermione squirmed. \'Horace.\'

\'And *Harry!*\' Slughorn\'s exclamation startled everyone nearby. \'You came.\'

\'Of course, professor.'

\'I had such trouble tempting your mother to these gatherings.\' Slughorn sighed. \'In the end, I had to convince several quite notable people to join us just to tempt her. She never liked the aperitifs much either.' He winked. 'And this must be the infamous Miss Bell.'

'Most infamous,' Harry quipped.

\'Charmed.\' Slughorn dipped his head and his neck disappeared into his chins. \'You\'re a lucky wizard, Harry.\'

\'Oh, we\'re just friends.' Katie glanced at where her arm looped through Harry's. 'Someone has to keep Harry company, or any blonde, ice-cream loving girl might come and steal him away out of nowhere.'

\'Well, you\'re welcome in any case!\' Slughorn clapped his hands together \'Have something to eat, or a drink, there\'s some lovely elven wine around her somewhere that I picked up in Italy. That\'s a country that knows wine, even the elven stuff seems to be better there.\'

'I'll be sure not to miss out,' Harry said.

Slughorn patted his belly. 'Just make sure you wait a few more years before you end up looking like me, Harry!' He drifted away through the crowd toward Cormac McLaggen.

Katie tugged Harry to the opposite side of the room and poured herself a brimming glass of wine.

'That is not how you're meant to fill up a wine glass,' Harry commented as she took a gulp. 'Or drink wine.'

'Keep your wine snobbery for Frenchie.' Katie offered him the glass. \'It\'s really nice, actually. The food looks good, too.\'

He borrowed it and took a sip. 'I don't think your wine habits are going to be Fleur's least favourite thing about this.'

Katie squirmed. 'She won't mind. It's just a party. It's not like I'm dragging you into a broom closet and seeing if you've learnt French kissing.' She giggled. 'Although, another couple of glasses of this and you might be able to tempt me, Harry.'

'You're not the one who has to explain this to Fleur.' Harry grimaced. 'Maybe I *should've* taken Romilda, at least Fleur knows I'd've hated going with her.'

*If I were her, I'd hate to hear about me doing this.* A knot of guilt tangled beneath his ribs, hot and tipped with sharp, cold thorns. *Sorry, Fleur. I didn't think this through. I'll make it up to you.*

Katie pouted at him. 'I'm going to find us some food. Try not to start another fight over ice cream with the Greengrass sisters.'

Harry sighed and threw a look at where the Greengrass sisters were sitting in the corner, chatting with each other and ignoring the rest of the world. *I don't think there even is any ice cream.*

'Harry! You've lost your date!' Slughorn's belly floated through the tables beneath a tapestry-patterned waistcoat and straining brass buttons. 'How about I find you some company?' He took Harry's arm and led him across the room. 'Daphne and Astoria only received my invitation at the last minute, it seems, and didn't

have time to find a date, so perhaps you'd be so kind as to stand in for a little while!'

Harry met two cool, blue stares and caught the same glimpse of resignation in them as he felt. 'Sure. Why not. But---\' he wagged his finger at Astoria '---you have to share the ice cream this time. Just not the pistachio one.'

Astoria grinned. 'That's fine. You can share with Daph.' 'No he can't,' Daphne replied. 'There's no ice cream here at

all.'

'How unfortunate.'

Slughorn clapped Harry on the shoulder. 'Already as thick

as thieves. I can tell you're going to be great friends.' He trundled

away into the thick of the party.

Harry inspected his nails. 'So, did you *actually* get the

invitation late?'

'I've no interest in taking a *boy* here,' Astoria said. 'Daph's just really antisocial and doesn't like any of the boys here enough to put up with them.'

He chuckled. 'Unlucky for them.'

'A shame.' Astoria's grin broadened. 'Because from the

rumours *I've* heard, she's exactly your type.'

Daphne rolled her eyes. 'So are you, Astoria.'

'Maybe in about five years,' Harry said. 'No offence, Astoria.' 'None taken.' She poked her sister in the boob. 'I don't really

have these, yet. Whereas Daph...'

'Right.' A touch of heat crept onto his face. 'And on that note, I think I've lingered long enough to satisfy Slughorn, so I'm going to abandon you both to whisper to each other again and go find Katie.'

'Bye!' Astoria gave him a little wave, then nudged her sister. 'Don't be rude, Daph.'

'Bye, Harry,' Daphne murmured. 'Enjoy the party.'

*Where has Katie vanished to?* He drifted through the tables.

*I hope she's not drinking at the same rate she started at.*

'Harry.' Hermione stepped in front of him. 'Where's Katie?' 'I was just wondering the same thing,' he said. 'Where's

Ron?'

Hermione pointed an arm at the table behind her. 'He found

the food.'

'Right.' Harry chuckled. 'Stupid question.' 'And Katie...'

'She also went to find food, but I got kidnapped by Slughorn and forced to talk to other people.'

'The Greengrass sisters.' Hermione's lips thinned. 'I saw.' 'You could have come and talked to us,' Harry said. 'I mean,

they're not all that chatty, but you could have *tried*.'

'Astoria seems friendly.'

Harry narrowed his eyes and let a little ice creep into his

tone. 'I'm not sure I like the implication there, Hermione.'

She flinched. 'I didn't mean that. It's just not very fair to Katie, is it?'

'It isn't?'

*'No.*'Hermione put her hands on her hips. 'It's very un---\' \'Professor Slughorn!\' Filch stomped through the door,

clutching a writhing Malfoy by the scruff of his neck. \'I found this one lurking nearby.\'

Harry slipped away from Hermione when she glanced at Malfoy. *I'd much rather find Katie than squabble with you about whatever it is you think I'm doing wrong now.*

\'I was coming here.\' Malfoy sighed. \'And since I have been...

*assisted* here, you can let go of me now.\'

\'A gate-crasher!\' Slughorn chuckled. \'There\'s always one!

Come in, there\'s drinks and food aplenty. Though I'm afraid, Mr Malfoy, that next time you won't get off so lightly. You only get one free pass!\'

*He came to gate-crash without a date?* Harry studied Malfoy's creased Slytherin school robes and uncombed hair. *And dressed like that? He was definitely sneaking.*

Hermione worried her lip on the far side of the room, watching Malfoy just as he was.

Malfoy sneered. \'Something the matter, Potter?\'

\'Unpleasant company.\' Harry studied his thumbnail. 'I'll

endure.'

\'Sometimes it just can\'t be helped.\' Malfoy glanced across

the room at Hermione. \'But times are changing, soon we won\'t have

to put up with muggleborns, blood traitors, or *you*. My father will have his repayment.\'

\'Never liked Lucius.\' Harry shot Malfoy his best imitation of

Fleur's smirk. \'Bit *two-faced* for my taste.\'

Malfoy\'s hand flicked towards his waist, then dropped to his side. \'You\'ll get yours, Potter,\' he hissed. \'The Dark Lord will strip everything you hold dear from you.\'

\'Not if I strip everything away from him first.\' Harry let his

smirk turn cold. 'And I will.'

Malfoy took a step back. \'Theo will be avenged.'

'Not by you,\' Harry said. \'You\'re a small fish, Draco. Even mummy and daddy can't hold a candle to me anymore. They know it, you know it, I know it, and Voldemort does too.\'

\'My father is worth a hundred of you,\' Malfoy snapped.

'He's worth nothing.' Harry stepped close to him and lowered his voice. 'Soon, he'll *be* nothing.'

\'We\'ll see about that, Potter.' Malfoy turned on his heel,

brushing past Hermione and stalking out.

Katie reappeared, balancing two dishes of focaccia on her arm and beaming from ear to ear, with a bright gleam in her mahogany eyes, wine-reddened lips, and flushed cheeks. \'Why the sour face?\'

\'I had a brief chat with Malfoy,\' Harry said.

\'How boring. Every other word he says is father or mudblood. He\'s not good conversation at all.\'

\'Sadly I seem to have no better alternatives.' Harry stole a piece of focaccia. 'Just this degenerate quidditch-fiend who keeps telling me how bad she is at remembering to wear underwear.'

Katie laughed and finished her glass of wine. 'If you didn't enjoy it, I wouldn't keep telling you.'

*How many of those has she had?* Harry tried to guess the amount of alcohol in a glass. *And she definitely had at least one shot of fire whiskey before leaving, too.*

'Don't feel like you have to stick with me,' he said. 'You can

rove.'

\'There aren\'t many people to talk to,\' she said. \'I don\'t really

know anyone else here except you.\'

\'Shall I get Professor Slughorn to introduce you?' Harry laughed. 'He won't mind.'

\'No.\' Katie shook her head. \'I\'m happy here.\' She looped her arm through his and leant against his side, letting the warmth of her body soak into him through the thin silk of her dress. The strap of her bra dug into his ribs.

'Liar. You *are* wearing underwear, I can feel it.'

She snorted. 'Sure you don't want to sneak off somewhere and check?'

*Yeah, you've had enough of these.* Harry removed her wine

glass from harm's way and set it down out of her reach on the table.

\'Such a gentleman.' She giggled. \'Making sure I don\'t do

anything silly.\'

\'A lost battle.'

\'I do a lot of silly things,' she murmured. \'But not tonight!' \'That's\... good?' Harry smothered a faint stab of anxiety. \'You\'re okay, aren\'t you?\' Katie asked. \'You\'re happy?\'

Harry shrugged. \'Well, it isn\'t the greatest party, but I\'ll live.'

\'I meant in general.' She waved a fistful of focaccia at him. 'You always seem pretty happy when we're together, but what about all the rest of the time? How do I know you're okay?'

\'I\'m fine,\' he said. \'You, however, Katie dearest, are drunk,

*already*.\'

\'Already?\' Katie protested.

Harry pointed at the clock. 'Perhaps we should head back, I

don't mind leaving early and Slughorn just seemed pleased I made an appearance.'

\'I might need assistance,\' she admitted. 'There's a slim chance that the heels I chose to go with this dress were bought without the thought of drinking very much in mind.'

\'Here.\' Harry slipped an arm around her waist. 'You can lean on me if you wobble.'

Katie tugged his arm tight around her and rested her head on his shoulder, waving goodbye to everyone as they departed. Harry tilted his head toward her when he caught sight of Slughorn's crestfallen expression and gave the man a small shrug.

'Pace yourself, Miss Bell!' Slughorn let out a booming laugh. 'It pays not to go too fast! Have a lovely evening, you two.'

Katie clung to Harry's side as they drifted back toward Gryffindor Tower. \'You never answered my question,\' she said as the Fat Lady swung aside.

\'I did,\' Harry said. \'I said I was fine.\'

\'That doesn\'t mean anything,\' Katie growled. \'You'd say that if you *weren't* fine. You've got a Dark Lord after you, Dumbledore's up to something, you said as much, and the only people on your side are me and Frenchie.' She waved a hand at the window. 'And Frenchie is miles away.'

Harry stifled a little knot of unease. 'And Nev.' He pointed at

where Nev snored, still stuck in the chair by the fire.

\'You can always rely on me.' Katie stumbled over the rug by

the fire and fell to her knees. 'Oops.'

\'I know I can.' He helped her onto the sofa. 'You feeling

okay?'

'Not really.' Katie slumped into him and kicked her shoes off.

'It's all happy, then all sad, then all happy, then all sad. It just goes

\'round and \'round. I want it to stop, but I *don't.*'

'That makes absolutely no sense, drunk Katie.'

'Well, you can try and ask sober Katie tomorrow, but she's not going to tell you anything.' She yawned and settled her head onto his shoulder. \'I\'m sleepy now,\' she murmured, tugging his arm \'round her. \'Don\'t move.\'

*Merde.* Harry waited until her breathing evened out and she fell asleep, then swept her off the sofa into his arms, scooped up her shoes and slipped his wand from his sleeve.

Her fingers curled into his clothes and she nestled her head into his chest.

'Fleur's right, isn't she,' Harry murmured below his breath. He choked down a fist of feeling and released a long sigh. '*Katie...*'

He freed Nev with a flick of his wand and strode toward the staircase. *I need to talk to Fleur before I talk to Katie about this. I need to know what she wants me to do.*

\'Confundo,\' he muttered as the stairs attempted to become a slide, carrying Katie up to her bed.

Harry laid her down on her side, brushed her hair off her face, and pried her fingers loose from his robes. 'Sleep well, Katie.' He smothered a flash of memories from Hogsmeade and the recollection of her tears soaking into his shoulder and the sharp twist of feeling in his gut, then transfigured her bra and dress into one of the quidditch shirts she usually slept in, covering it in multi-coloured seashells. 'There, perfect.'

He drifted back down and sat before the fire, staring into the flames and twirling his wand \'round. *What am I meant to do?* Harry ignored Hermione and Ron stumbling back in and watched the embers fade in the grate. *Katie's my best friend. She promised. And she kept her promise. I can't push her away after that.* A fist of panic clamped around his heart. *But Fleur won't like it. She's not going to like it at all. Fuck. Why did Fleur have to be right?*

# Ianus's Choice

Soft, sour fumes drifted across the room over plush velvet chairs and the frenzied efforts of the class. Slughorn trundled between the cauldrons, peering into each one and snacking on crystallised lime pieces.

Harry stoppered his flask and tidied his things away, making

sure to clean every trace of today's ingredients off.

\'Excellent, Hermione!\' Slughorn squeezed his belly past her cauldron and Ron\'s. \'Exemplary work! Everyone here could learn a thing or two from you---\' he chuckled '---well, everyone except Harry, of course.\'

\'Thank you, sir.\' Hermione's eyes flicked to Harry, then she

snapped shut her tattered tome and stuffed it into her bag.

*She's still using that battered back-up book instead of getting herself a nice new one\...* Harry trailed her to the front and set his own flask down next to hers on Slughorn's desk. *And all the tweaks she's making this year are very similar to the ones I'm coming up with, which she definitely wasn't doing last year.*

Hermione studied his. \'Nearly identical.' She sniffed. 'If anything, mine's slightly better.'

\'Joint top of the year.\' Harry sighed. \'Such a catastrophe. Although, I'll admit Slughorn seems to be favouring me a fraction when we're neck and neck. My mother, probably.'

Hermione nodded and followed him back to their table. \'At least you can admit you're getting all the marginal calls in your favour. I'm surprised you know how to do everything you're doing.'

\'I had a little bit of outside help to make sure I can take this subject early with the other three NEWTs.' He glanced at her bag. 'Speaking of which, you don\'t mind me looking at your Potions textbook, do you? You never used to do anything but follow the rules of the recipe, now suddenly here you are experimenting away...'

\'Get your own,\' she said. \'But mine\'s in my bag.' \'So\'s mine.'

\'I\'ll steal it,\' Harry said. \'In the night, I'll come up to your dormitory and take it. And if you make me stoop to that level, I may as well steal every pair of panties in the tower, just to continue my father\'s legacy.\'

\'Fine.\' Hermione sighed. \'It has a few annotations, they\'re useful, but I don\'t know who wrote them.\' She extracted the book from her bag and flicked through the pages, then thrust it under his nose. 'See.'

A familiar cramped, slanted script filled the margins.

*She has the same assistance I do.*

\'Mystery solved,\' Harry said. \'I was curious.\'

\'Just curious?\' Hermione narrowed her eyes. 'You're never

*just* curious. You have a motive for everything you do.'

'You make me sound like some storybook villain, Hermione.' 'Life's not a story,' she muttered.

\'That book belonged to our former professor of this subject when he was younger,' Harry said. 'The handwriting is the exact same as his.'

\'Snape?\' Hermione gasped and stuffed the book back into

her bag like it was Class A contraband. 'Really?'

'Yeah, be careful with anything you read. He may be a member of the Order now, but he\'s always loved the Dark Arts and we both know how dangerous blindly believing what a book says can be.\' He caught her gaze. 'If you've forgotten, just ask Ginny.'

\'I know.' Hermione scowled and the bags under her eyes darkened. 'Snape goes on about the Dark Arts as if he were in love. Parvati's started having nightmares about her sister becoming an inferius and strangling her. She's in the bed next to mine and she wakes me up when she does.\' She shuddered. \'I\'ve never seen Parvati look so terrified.\'

\'He\'s not wrong though,\' Harry murmured as they left the lab. \'The things the Ministry classifies as dark are often powerful, it\'s better Parvati know how to destroy an inferius and lose a little sleep than get ripped apart by one.\'

Hermione\'s frown deepened. \'They're illegal for a reason. Snape makes them look attractive to students like Malfoy who have few morals and too much ambition.\'

\'He\'s a lost cause already,\' Harry said. 'You saw how he was stealing around again while we were at Slughorn\'s party? I doubt he was intending to gate-crash when Filch found him.\'

\'I did. He seems particularly hateful of you, now.\'

*I killed one of his friends and stood alongside Sirius when he scarred his father.*

\'He\'s always disliked me,\' Harry said. 'He has no spine, though. He's not going to do anything unless his own life's on the line, and even then he'd probably just make a mess of it.'

\'Draco.\' Snape's soft whisper echoed down the corridor.

Harry glanced in the reflection of the window and caught a glimpse of Malfoy being half-dragged into an empty classroom.

*Interesting.*

'I'll see you later, Hermione.'

She caught his arm. 'Stop avoiding Katie.'

He tugged himself free. 'Stop involving yourself in things

you're not invited to be involved in.'

Hermione huffed and stalked off. Harry disillusioned himself and slipped into the back of the empty classroom.

\'What do you think you\'re doing?\' Snape hissed, pinning Malfoy against the wall by his shoulder. \'You *know* the task that the Dark Lord has given you. Stick to it!\'

\'This is the only way I'll survive carrying it out,\' Malfoy spat. \'He murdered Theo. He\'s probably the one who maimed my father. He\'ll curse me again without hesitation.\'

\'It was Sirius Black who charred your father\'s face.' Snape sneered. \'Petty revenge will get you killed. The Dark Lord may not have commanded his followers to leave Potter be, but that's simply because he believes them incapable of killing him. If his followers are foolish enough to hurl themselves at Potter, then the Dark Lord is just curious as to what Potter will do.\'

\'Potter isn\'t *that* powerful.'

\'Barty Crouch Junior. Peter Pettigrew. Bertha Jorkins.

Bellatrix Lestrange. Avery. Yaxley. Macnair. Jugson. Theodore Nott. Nott Senior.\'

*He knows about almost all of them*. *And he's perfectly placed to tell Dumbledore and Riddle about anything I do in the future.* Harry balled his fists and swallowed a stab of panic. *He has to go. He's too dangerous. The second Dumbledore realises I've no intention of dying to save everyone, he'll kill me to get rid of the horcrux, and Snape can convince him at any moment.*

Malfoy shook his head. \'I don\'t believe you.'

'The Dark Lord has attributed those losses to Potter himself.\' Snape\'s lips curled. \'Disagree with him at your own risk.\'

\'Then the Dark Lord is wrong!\'

Snape tutted. \'Do you really think so? You\'re being foolish, both in not believing what is plain to see and in drawing attention to yourself. Complete the task the Dark Lord has given you and remain safe at Hogwarts for the rest of the war.\'

\'Like you care whether I am safe or not,\' Malfoy muttered. \'I know about the oath you gave my mother. You just want me to be successful so you don\'t have to follow through on your Unbreakable Vow and risk your own skin.\'

\'Be quiet,\' Snape hissed. \'You petulant, arrogant infant. You know nothing about what you speak and clearly very little about what you\'re doing.\' His black eyes burnt with rage. \'I am trying to keep you *alive* and antagonising Potter is a very *very* stupid thing to do.'

Malfoy cowered. \'If he's so powerful and dangerous why

doesn\'t the Dark Lord do something about him?\'

'Potter hides his true nature from Dumbledore. He will move directly against the Dark Lord and drop the act he so convincingly wields the moment the headmaster is gone. Albus Dumbledore is the only one Potter believes himself outmatched by on their side.\'

\'Then he is as arrogant as always,' Malfoy spat.

\'Is he?\' Snape frowned. \'You\'ve fed him enough aconite to kill half the school and he hasn\'t even noticed. Those Death Eaters he killed; they didn\'t die in their sleep and nor were they killed from behind. Your aunt was a formidable duellist, despite her madness and the effects of fifteen years imprisonment in Azkaban, and she was pulled out of that fountain the same day Potter was walking around school without a scratch on him.\'

*Aconite.* Cold shock coursed through his veins. *I'm immune,*

*but anyone nearby could've died. Katie...*

\'Maybe he has noticed, then.\' Malfoy swallowed hard. 'Do you think he has?'

\'You would already be dead,\' Snape murmured. \'Potter does not seem to play with his food like some of our foolish allies, especially not those who endanger his friends. If he knows, then he's saving you for something worth risking his life for. That would worry me far more than the alternative.\'

\'You speak about him the same way you talk about Dumbledore, and the Dark Lord,\' Malfoy whispered.

\'Occasionally, a wizard is born with the potential to be more than great,\' Snape said. \'You are a strong wizard for your age, as am I, but the Dark Lord, Dumbledore, and Potter are all a little bit beyond the rest of us. Potter is very young and already formidable. He is the weakest of the three, it's true, but also the most dangerous.

Dumbledore and the Dark Lord have clear goals and ideologies.

They're predictable to a certain extent. Dumbledore is a champion of his Greater Good --- a purer form of the philosophy Grindelwald once advocated. The Dark Lord seeks dominion, obedience, and recognition, because he believes himself the strongest. Potter... Potter has no objectives I've been able to glean. He is ruthless, cunning, powerful, and unpredictable. Stop baiting him, before you get us both killed.\'

*He lied.* Harry frowned. *He must know. He's seen my patronus. He's heard about Fleur. Other wizards might not understand, but he would. He loved my mother just the same.*

A bitter laugh burst from Malfoy's lips. \'It will just be *me* who dies. My father\'s connections in the Ministry are cut and those outside it are in direct contact with the Dark Lord, our wealth is useless now Gringotts have frozen our vaults, and my mother is not a fighter. I am the only useful Malfoy remaining and this is my family\'s punishment for failing the Dark Lord.\'

\'If you\'re cunning, nobody will suspect you, and you will escape notice, remaining safe here when Potter leaves these walls to openly oppose the Dark Lord,\' Snape replied.

\'I am already being watched,\' Malfoy said. \'The mudblood Granger is watching me as often as she is Potter.\'

\'Do *not* use that word,\' Snape spat. \'The Dark Lord despises muggles, not muggleborns, power is power, and magic is magic, no matter the source.\'

\'Purebloods have more magic, and more power,\' Malfoy

retorted.

\'Go,\' Snape ordered. \'Do what you've been ordered to do,

and stop drawing attention to yourself and your task if you want to live.\'

\'*Our* task,\' Malfoy shot over his shoulder. \'Don\'t forget your vow, professor.\'

'Childish little brat.' Snape's fingers curled into fists and he ground his teeth. 'Even if he succeeds, it needs to be without the faintest hint of suspicion.'

*Malfoy always fails*. *Once he has failed enough times Snape can't convince himself he'll succeed, he'll be forced to try himself because of his vow. Snape isn't an idiot. He won't care about the harm he does to others. He'll succeed.*

He slipped from the room and hurried toward Snape's office.

*I need to know what Malfoy's task is. But if Snape knows, then*

*Dumbledore likely knows.*

Harry paused before the door. 'Best not to go in without my cloak,' he murmured. 'There'll be wards.'

*Aconite.* He summoned one of the glass goblets and tucked it under his arm, then rummaged through the store cupboard.

*Aconite, aconite, aconite.* Harry scooped enough aconite to kill a hippogriff into the goblet, sealing it shut with a piece of paper and sticking charm, then wedged it into his bag. *If I have to, I can get rid of Snape, pin it on Malfoy, then wait for Dumbledore to run out of that potion. Perfect.*

Harry strode through the corridors, pausing to release his

disillusionment, then slipped into Myrtle's Bathroom.

'The faintest imprint of a soul. Anchored by regret.' He caught the eye of his reflection in the mirror and recalled Myrtle's fading. 'Did she stop regretting?'

*It doesn't matter.* Harry slipped down the steps into the Chamber of Secrets and dropped his bag on the desk in the study. *I need to speak to Fleur.*

He whirled the world back past him until he was stepping into the kitchen at the Meadow. A slim pair of arms threw themselves around him and the faint, sweet scent of marzipan drifted to his nose. 'Bonjour, mon Rêve,' Harry murmured, twisting about to press a light kiss to Fleur\'s nose.

\'Did you miss me, bird-wizard?\' A small, warm smile curved

her lips. 'You better have missed me.'

\'You know I always miss you,' Harry whispered. 'Every second I'm away.'

'Is that why you came back so suddenly? You missed me?'

The humour faded from him and a faint shot of panic coursed through his veins. 'No.' He swallowed. 'We need to talk about Katie.'

Fleur's eyes darkened several hues and her fingertips dug into his back. 'What did she do?'

'Nothing.' He grimaced. 'Well, nothing out of the ordinary. I took her to Slughorn's party, which maybe was a mistake. She drank enough to get talkative and --- and I think you might be right...'

'Did she do anything?'

'No.' Harry shook his head. 'She was just clingy and... *Katie.* I tucked her into bed when she fell asleep on me. I've avoided her the last couple of days.'

Fleur's eyes flashed black. 'When she fell asleep *on* you,

monCœur?'

'Pardon,' Harry whispered. 'I didn't want to hurt her.' 'But you'll hurt me.'

His heart seized. '*No!'* He pulled her tight against him. 'No. I

just --- I wasn't sure --- I wanted to talk to you before I did anything.' Her eyes faded back to summer sky blue. 'Was she happy?'

\'I haven\'t seen her so happy in a long time,\' Harry admitted. 'She mumbled something about being happy or sad a lot, but she wasn't making much sense.'

\'Will there be more parties?\' Fleur asked.

\'I need to stay on Slughorn\'s good side to get him to give me permission to take my NEWT early, but I\'m sure I can take someone else, or go alone.\'

\'Non. Take Katie.\'

\'Why?\' Harry studied the gleam in her blue eyes. 'Are you ---

are you *testing* me?'

Fleur kissed him hard enough she left his lips tingling. 'I don't *have* to test you. I know you. You will never choose anyone or anything over me. I would rather you went with Katie, who just wishes I'll disappear and let her have you, than someone who might do something worse with a love potion or spell.'

He tilted her face up to look at her and kissed her cheeks. \'I\'ll take Katie, then. I --- I like Katie. She's my best friend. She's *loyal.* I can't---\'

'I didn't ask you to stop doing anything you've been doing,' she whispered. 'I don't like how she flirts with you or how you respond to it.' Fleur's eyes darkened. 'You are *mine.* However, I trust you. I'm not asking you to stop being her friend. I know how important she is to you.'

*You're better at this than me.* Guilt gnawed at his gut. *I*

*panicked. I couldn't trust you.*

'Je suis désolé,' he murmured, tugging her close and breathing

in the scent of the marzipan.

Fleur pulled his head down against her breast. 'Don't feel too bad, monCœur. You're getting better.' She rested her cheek on his head and sighed. 'We're perfect for one another. I make up for the bits of you that were lost or cut away. You make up for the pieces I gave up on.'

# Birdsong

Weak sunlight filtered in through the curtains, falling in a bright beam across Harry's cheek, and the faint tune of birds rang out beyond the walls. Fleur wriggled through the duvet and snuggled her face into the back of his neck.

'Fleur,' he murmured, sliding a hand back \'round to find her fingers and tangling their legs together beneath the covers.

She kissed the nape of his neck. 'You might have been missed, monCœur.'

'I don't care.' He rolled over and wrapped her up in the warmth of his arms. 'I just want to leave all this behind. I want to close my eyes again and wake up beneath the willow in France. I can't stand the feeling of all the seconds dragging by when you're not there.'

'Just a little longer to wait.' Fleur closed her eyes and breathed

in his sleep-edged scent. 'We only need to find that horcrux.'

'Dumbledore found it,' Harry replied. 'All three are gone.

When we kidnap Travers, we can just kill him. We can just kill all of them. Travers, the Lestranges, Rookwood, Dolohov, Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and anyone else.'

'Wipe them all away until it's just us and we're free,' Fleur whispered. 'Once you have your NEWTs, that is.'

He groaned. 'Yes. I have to wait for that, first.'

She opened her eyes and found his green irises a finger's length away from her. 'Do you have anything else to tell me?'

'Malfoy has some task to complete. He was trying to poison me, which is a complete waste of his time, fortunately, but I think he's given up now.' He chuckled. 'I'll find out what he's meant to be doing from Dumbledore. And, speaking of Dumbledore, he contracted the Withering Curse while destroying the horcrux. He's dying, or he would be if Snape wasn't brewing some potion to keep him alive.'

Fleur digested all of that, wiggling her toes against his legs. 'Kill Snape,' she murmured. 'If he dies, then Dumbledore might die. That's half of your problems solved. Kill Malfoy, too. It doesn't matter what he was meant to do, just make sure he can't do it.'

'If they're all dead, they can't hurt us,' Harry whispered.

*No. They can't. Once they're all gone, we can do whatever we*

*want to.*

'And speaking of *dead.'* Fleur smothered a yawn. 'I tracked one of the Hallows down. The Elder Wand. It was easy enough to trace, in the end. It leaves a trail of death. Gregorovitch, the wandmaker, had it about a hundred years ago, then it was stolen. Grindelwald used the mark, of course, but if he was the one who stole the wand, there's no proof of it.'

'I don't care about the wand.' Harry pushed the duvet down and pressed his lips to hers. 'I have a wand already.'

'The Elder Wand needed to be *taken*,' Fleur said. 'The Resurrection Stone might be the same.'

'What does *taken* entail?'

\'The Elder Wand has been claimed by theft, murder, duelling, and disarming, that I know of. Any method of taking it without the consent of the owner seems to work.\'

\'So I should make sure to take the stone,\' Harry said. \'I'd probably have to anyway, nobody in their right mind would willingly give it up.\'

Fleur craned her neck at the clock. 'It's nearly half eight...'

Harry groaned. 'I have to go back. I know.' He pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead, then slipped out from under the covers, leaving a cold space beside her. 'I love you. I'll be back soon. Be *careful*.'

Fleur's heart squirmed. 'I love you too.'

He vanished with a soft snap.

*I should've asked him how he feels about children.* Fleur's hand crept down to her abdomen. *And I should try the charm again. It's been long enough.*

She rolled out of bed into the cool breeze and touched the tip of her wand to the curve between her hips. 'J'espère que...' Fleur whispered, heart racing and stomach churning. She closed her eyes. 'I hope...'

Her magic swirled beneath her skin, hot and soft as sun- soaked silk.

*Nothing.* Fleur sighed and caught sight of the dried, red smear on her thigh. *Well, nothing but ruined underwear. Still, it's probably for the best.* Her stomach continued to churn and she swallowed a bitter taste as a dozen silver-haired little girls with Harry's eyes and her nose danced through her thoughts. *And yet...*

She stepped into the shower and washed the blood away, then dried herself with a charm and dragged on the first set of underwear and dress she found. 'What to do?'

A green-eyed version of a young Gabby hovered in the back of her head, filling her stomach full of fluttering.

'Merde.' Fleur pictured the balcony over Beauxbatons and bounced the little bead on her palm. 'Aimée.'

She stepped to the edge of the balustrade and stared north over the foothills of the Pyrenees toward distant England. *I hate this place. A nest of shallow, spiteful little people.*

The door creaked.

'Fleur?' Gabby's footsteps pattered across the stone. 'Why're you here? Is everything okay? You didn't do something stupid with Harry again, did you?'

Fleur sighed and twisted \'round, her fingers creeping to the

curve of her stomach. 'I was a little late this month. For a little while...'

Gabby's eyes dropped to where Fleur's hand rested. 'I remember you saying you didn't want children not so long ago.'

'I didn't like the idea of having them with someone less than perfect,' she replied. 'Or throwing them into the same ugly world we endure.'

'You wouldn't be here if you were just relieved.' Gabby joined her at the balustrade. 'You wanted to be pregnant?'

'A little bit,' she murmured. 'I would very much like to make things with him and what could be more precious than something that's half of each of us.'

'Well, you had your chance, Fleur.' Gabby stuck her tongue out. 'Now it's *my* turn to help produce the next generation of the veela harem.'

Fleur choked on her laugh. 'I think you've got further through that series than I did. Those books get weird at the end.'

'They really do. I skimmed through to see if the plot changed.' 'Did it?'

Gabby laughed. 'Well, the plot disappears, if that counts. In fact, they really abandon all pretence of romance completely. There's a lot of veela bodice ripping and some really bizarre themes.' A mischievous gleam lit up in her eyes. 'Want to see if Harry likes them?'

'No.' Fleur shot her a glare. 'And you should stop reading them as well, little chick. Real romance is not like that.'

'I'm not interested in real romance.' Gabby's grey eyes darkened. 'I can feel it, you know, in his magic. He loves you more than anything. You're like --- like the sun for him.' A small smile crossed her lips. 'If I can't have that, I won't be happy with anything else.'

'Well, you'll need to find your own,' Fleur said. 'I'm not sharing him. There's notgoing to be *any* kind of veela harem.'

'I know.' Gabby's hand rested on hers. 'You couldn't share him even if you wanted to. The slightest possibility he might not always be yours and you'd lose faith. Just another fickle little person.'

A soft warmth flickered through Fleur's chest. *She knows me very well.*

'Are we so different?' she asked.

'Yes. I can feel it.' Gabby smiled up at Fleur. 'It's not a bad thing. We were a little different to begin with and you had to go first. I had you to hold my hand. You went alone.'

'I hate this place,' Fleur murmured.

'I know.' Gabby glanced up. 'Will you try?' She poked Fleur in the stomach with her finger. 'For real?'

*I could.* Fleur let herself dream of little girls, of Harry and herself listening to little feet under the willow tree, and of tiny fingers curled around one of her own. Her heart flopped about beneath her ribs. *I want to. One day. Some day.*

'I'll spoil your baby *rotten*.' Gabby beamed. 'I'm going to be the cool aunt and sneak them sweets.' She gasped. 'No! Wait! I can't be the cool aunt, because after Harry's given you a child you'll be busy and I can finally take my rightful place as queen of the harem.'

Fleur rolled her eyes and fought the pout threatening to creep

onto her lips. 'Gabby you've never even seen a boy naked.'

'Don't worry, Harry'll fix that!' Gabby giggled. 'You look cross,

Fleur.'

'I ought to toast you.' Fleur sighed. 'But all I can think about is

this. Part of me is glad, because this isn't a good time, and I think Harry might have a full panic attack if I so much as stub my toe while pregnant.'

Gabby laughed. 'He will lock you in the house if he can.'

'I don't think I'll tell him.' Fleur pushed little chips of stone off the balustrade. 'I won't be careful and I'll tell him when it starts to show.' Her breath stuck in her throat as she envisioned the moment. 'A perfect surprise.'

Gabby shook her head. 'That's a *stupid* idea, Fleur. He knows you better than that. What're you going to tell him, you just forgot that you might get pregnant? And that you forgot to mention it for three months? He'll know it was deliberate.'

'He'd be upset,' Fleur murmured. 'But afterward, when he realises how precious what we've made is, he'll be so happy.'

'*Fleur.'* Gabby's tone sharpened and her grey eyes turned black. 'His trust is *fragile*. Manipulate him and you'll make him wonder how real his dream is. Once he starts thinking like that, you won't be able to stop him.'

*Harry will never abandon his perfect wish.* Fear dug cold, sharp claws into her heart and her breath caught. *But if he thought it was never real, then he might leave. And he'd hate me.* Hot tears brimmed against her lashes. *And I nearly did it just because I thought it would be beautiful.*

'You\'re not such a smart girl sometimes, Fleur,' Gabby said. 'If you love someone, you don't hurt them. Not even if you think it will make them really happy afterward.'

'But---'

'*Fleur,'* Gabby snapped. 'Imagine how Harry will feel. You would've lied to him. You would've manipulated him. You think he won't wonder if this is the first time? Of course he will! He'll wonder about all the other times you've done it and he's not realised. He'll doubt *every word you say*.'

'I know,' she whispered. 'But I never think about that. All I see is that moment after the pain, when it's all worth it.'

'Then you're lucky you have such a wonderful little sister to

stop you from being stupid,' Gabby chirped.

'I am.' Fleur gathered Gabby into a hug and mussed her silver hair. 'I love you, little chick.'

'I know.' Gabby beamed. 'I can feel it.' She wriggled out of Fleur's embrace. 'You know, if you want to do this, you're going to have to marry him pretty soon...'

Fleur wrinkled her nose. 'Maman and Papa would probably prefer that.'

'Maman will throw a fit if you get pregnant before you get married.' Gabby giggled into her hand. 'Plus, I think it will help with Harry, non?'

*Yes. Yes it will.* The bronze ring shone on her finger before the eye of her mind. *He'd probably be less panicked about me leaving if we were married.* A stray thought rose up to scatter her optimism.

*But asking me gives me the chance to say no...*

'He'll never ask,' Fleur said. 'Non?'

'Non.' She tossed her hair over her shoulder. 'He'd be too afraid I'd not be ready or not want to say yes, and that it'd ruin things.'

Gabby nodded. 'I think you're right.' She laughed. 'You'll have to ask *him* then. Strange, to think you'll be all married and pregnant by the time I'm doing my NEWTs.'

'Have you decided what to do afterward?' Fleur asked.

'I'm going to join you.' The mischief burst back into life in her grey eyes. 'In the veela harem.'

'You can go and do your own thing, Gabby,' Fleur said. 'You don't have to follow me.'

'I want to.' Gabby bit her lip. 'I said I can feel it, that you love me. Papa and Maman, too. Everything is all cold and grey when you're gone. I can't live like that, so I'll go where you all go.'

'I can probably convince Harry to come to France.' Fleur smirked. 'Actually, I *know* I can convince him. You can help.'

Gabby cheered. 'Veela sisters threesome!'

Fleur swatted her on the top of the head. 'Hush, little chick. I love you, but I don't love you *that* much.'

Gabby giggled, then shot Fleur a hopeful look. 'Clafoutis?' 'Fine.' Fleur sighed and mussed Gabby's hair. 'I suppose I do

owe you something. You did stop me from doing something stupid

again.'

'You owe me a lot more than clafoutis, really.' Mischief glimmered in Gabby's grey eyes. 'What about a kiss? From Harry, of course. I don't want *you* to kiss me.'

'Non.' Fleur shook her head. 'It's clafoutis or nothing, you

greedy little harpy.'

Gabby pouted. 'Selfish. You're meant to share your veelabondmate with your veela sister, Fleur. It's the rules of the nudist veela conclave.'

Fleur grabbed her arm and apparated them onto the streets of

Paris. 'None of those are real things, Gabby. As you well know.'

'Clafoutis, then.' She skipped down the street, tugging Fleur after her. 'Cherries are the best.'

# Ex Memoria

The door to Dumbledore's office hung open at the top of the

small spiral staircase, Fawkes\'s cheerful trilling echoing from within.

*Time to find out what Malfoy's task is.* Harry knocked on the door and stepped into the room.

\'Come in, Harry, come in.\' Dumbledore pulled his half-moon glasses off his nose and set them down on the desk.

Fawkes snatched them up in one taloned foot and fluttered to his perch, waving the glasses up and down in his toes.

Dumbledore gave the phoenix a reproachful stare and turned to Harry. 'How have you been, Harry?\' He thrust his hand out and snatched the spectacles back from Fawkes. 'My apologies.

Fawkes, despite being spoilt with an endless supply of magical toys,

prefers to steal my glasses.'

\'Fairly well.' Harry's fingers slipped to the slim gold chain about his neck. 'I've found myself with a little time to spare recently.'

\'Professor Snape told me you've done a remarkable job in teaching some of the others in your year the Patronus Charm.\' Dumbledore smiled and the corners of his bright blue eyes crinkled. \'A very admirable deed, my boy. It is a hard charm to cast, despite its simple theory, and yet so many of your peers have achieved a corporeal version. Perhaps you should consider teaching yourself one day.\'

\'I think I lack the necessary patience, sir,\' Harry admitted. \'Did Snape really use those words?\'

\'*Professor* Snape may not have said that in so many words, but his meaning was easy to infer.\'

\'After you picked your way through the insults?\' Harry

asked.

\'He was quite complimentary, I assure you, Harry. However,

I must admit a certain level of curiosity about the form of your patronus. I understand it is no longer a stag?\'

\'An anzu,\' Harry said. 'I'm absolutely sure Snape must've mentioned it.'

\'Remarkable,\' Dumbledore murmured. \'Miss Delacour is a lucky girl.\'

'Speaking of lucky girls, sir, Hermione warned me that Malfoy's been acting strangely. He's been lurking in strange places and been seen clutching his forearm.' Harry weighed his next words on the tip of his tongue. 'I saw Malfoy arguing with Snape about some task he has to fulfill. It was a very *heated* argument.\'

\'I am aware of Mr Malfoy\'s actions,\' Dumbledore said. 'Tom has given him a target, but I do not believe he has it in him to be successful as things are. Professor Snape is taking care of it nonetheless, Harry, and it would be best if you did not involve yourself. Mr Malfoy may act rashly if antagonised.\'

\'Of course, professor,\' Harry said. 'But just what exactly *is*

Malfoy's target? Is it something to do with me?'

'You are not his target, my boy. I suspect that it is more than likely to be myself, but, whomever the target is, I will keep them from harm.' Dumbledore sighed and ran his fingers through the length of his beard. 'But don\'t let it trouble you. Mr Malfoy, unlike his father, has yet to really make a choice about which side he wants to be on. I

hope to show him that there are other ways than those of his father before he loses himself. While he is in Hogwarts and fixated on this mission, I can keep him safe and make sure he does no harm to others.\'

*So Dumbledore has Malfoy in hand, but I bet Snape hasn't mentioned his Unbreakable Vow.* Harry kept his expression unreadable and brushed his fingers over the time-turner dangling beneath his robes. *I'm going to deal with Snape in a few minutes anyway. We'll see if he's worth the risk to Fleur or not.*

\'Your note mentioned a memory, sir?\' he asked.

\'Ah, yes. One of those I've collected from Tom's past.\' Dumbledore rose from his seat and opened the cabinet behind his desk to reveal a stone bowl covered in hundreds of tiny runes. \'Would you care to join me in the pensieve, Harry?'

'Of course.' Harry stepped around the desk to stare into the

swirling silver mist within the basin.

\'This recollection belongs to Professor Slughorn.\' Dumbledore poked at the mist with the tip of his wand.

\'What will it show us?\'

\'You will see.\' Dumbledore extended his bright-gloved hand. \'Coming, Harry?\'

He took hold of Dumbledore's fingers and with a sudden lurch, Harry found himself standing alongside Dumbledore in the same room he'd been brewing in only a few days ago. Identical furnishings surrounded them, though Slughorn's belly had less of a curve to it where he stood at the door to the room.

room.

'This way, Harry.' Dumbledore led him to one side of the

Slughorn paused in the doorway. \'Look sharp, Tom, you

don\'t want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect...\'

Tom strode into the centre of the room, and waved a hand around. Harry caught the gleam of a slim golden band on his finger and the faint, familiar, eldritch glow in his eyes.

*He's found Salazar by now, then. Is that where he originally got that ring from? Salazar never mentioned a ring.* Harry frowned. *I'll have to ask him once I have the Resurrection Stone.*

\'Sir, I wanted to ask you something,\' Tom said.

\'Ask away, then, m\'boy, ask away...\'

\'Sir, I wondered what you know about... about horcruxes?\'

Slughorn paused by his desk, fingering his wine glass.

'Project for Defence Against the Dark Arts, is it?'

\'Not exactly, sir,\' Tom said. \'I came across the term while reading and I didn\'t fully understand it.\'

\'No... Well... You\'d be hard pushed to find a book at Hogwarts that\'ll give you details on horcruxes, Tom. That\'s very dark stuff, very dark indeed.\'

*Dark stuff...* A faint smile curved the edge of Harry's lips. *It's a selfish, cruel, terrible piece of magic, but it has nothing to do with dark or light.*

The corner of Tom's mouth twitched.

\'As you can see, Harry,\' Dumbledore murmured. \'Tom was already quite proficient in extracting what he wanted to know from those around him. By the time he was this age, sixteen, he already knew far more than most adult wizards ever would about the intricacies of magic.\'

\'Why are we watching this, sir?\' Harry watched Tom drink in every word Slughorn said.

'This is the moment that I believe started Tom down the road to becoming Voldemort.\' Dumbledore sighed. \'The instant he decided that anything was better than death.\'

*No*. Harry stared stared into the terrible, desperate ambition reflected in Tom's eyes and the shadow of a vast, hopeless fear above it. *It's not. He was nothing once too. He even said so.*

\'Yes, sir,\' Tom said. 'What I still don\'t understand, though --- just out of curiosity --- I mean, would one horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldn\'t it be better, make you stronger---\' a gleam of hunger rippled through his eyes '---to have your soul in more pieces? For instance, isn\'t seven the most magically powerful number, wouldn\'t seven---\'

Shock coursed through Harry's veins and his heart hammered in his ears, drowning out Slughorn's yelp. *I underestimated him*. *Seven. Not three. Seven*. He struggled to keep his breathing even. *Merde. There're four more. We're no closer to freedom than we were a year ago...*

\'You understand now,\' Dumbledore said. \'I too looked just as horrified as you when I first saw this memory. Its revelation was part of the agreement for Professor Slughorn's return.\'

\'Seven,\' Harry murmured. \'So many.\'

\'I'd suspected such a thing for some years now,\' Dumbledore confessed, pulling them from the pensieve. \'I'd hoped for three, but I know, having seen this, that he intended to make seven, even if he was not successful.\'

\'Not successful?\' Harry asked.

\'Tom has always had a flair for melodrama and a terrible hubris. He would've gone beyond the requirements of the piece of magic and only created them from the deaths of those he thought noteworthy. I am certain of it.\'

\'The diary?\' Harry asked.

\'That diary is proof of his heritage and ancestry, something he has always been proud of,\' Dumbledore explained. 'It was also his first attempt, so perhaps the convenience outweighed his hubris.'

*No, that doesn't feel right.* Harry frowned. *The object has to be precious to him in its own right and he would've had Salazar as far better proof of his heritage and ancestry.* He shook the unease away. *It doesn't matter, that horcrux is destroyed.*

\'So we have destroyed two of seven?\' he asked.

\'Two of six,\' Dumbledore said. \'Seven pieces means six horcruxes, since one part of the soul must remain within the body.\'

\'Oh.\' Harry let a little sigh of relief escape. 'Well, that's better than seven horcruxes, I suppose.'

*The diary. The diadem. The ring. And now three more.*

\'I have, over the last few years of searching, located a few of

the items I believe to have been made into horcruxes by Voldemort.'

Dumbledore gestured at the pensieve. 'If you will venture with me

once more?\'

Harry drifted over to take the headmaster\'s gloved hand. *If Dumbledore knows more about these horcruxes, I can't risk his death yet*. He touched a finger to where the golden time-turner hung about his neck like a lead weight. *I will have to get rid of Snape before he can try and carry out his vow.*

They lurched into the pensieve.

An older, pale-faced Tom conversed with a slim old witch caked in make-up and dressed in fine silk and lace. A gleam of eldritch light shone in his irises, a slight crimson tint to the smooth mahogany.

\'He is eighteen,\' Dumbledore said as the old lady directed Riddle\'s attention to two velvet-lined boxes and a small platter of lemon cakes. \'You can see for yourself that his pursuit of power has already led him into controversial areas of magic.\'

*Rituals*. *Blood magic, too.* Harry studied the unnatural speed of Tom's movements. *How much had he sacrificed by this point? Are all his dreams already gone?*

\'Tom was, by now, quietly pursuing his own goal of immortality while he waited to apply for and take up a post at Hogwarts itself. He was much taken with the castle,' Dumbledore said. \'I believe it is the only place he ever considered home.'

Tom pried the boxes open. A golden badger gleamed upon an intricate goblet in the first and a heart-shaped silver locket emblazoned with a serpentine '*S'* sat in the second.

Harry's stomach churned and a tight, cold fist of fury clenched beneath his ribs. *He didn\'t...* The fading gleam of the ruined

diadem sinking down in the dark pool in the Chamber of Secrets flashed before his eyes. *He did. He tarnished the locket of Salazar's wife, the woman who sacrificed everything she had to help the family that would come after her.*

Crimson flecks swirled in Tom's eyes as he stared at them with undisguised lust, then a bright smile slid across his face and he turned back to the old lady. 'Remarkable pieces, but I can tell already you've no intention of entertaining an offer for them.'

'Heavens, no.' The woman giggled and fanned her face with her hand. 'I'd rather take them to my grave than let Borgin or Burke get their greasy hands on them. Honestly, Tom, I don't know how a nice boy like you can stand them.'

*I don't think there's anything left of Tom.* Harry caught the gleam of scarlet in Voldemort's irises. *He's already sacrificed everything Tom dreamt of.*

\'Hepzibah died later that week, accidentally poisoned by her house elf.\' Dumbledore shook his head. \'We both know, however, that that was unlikely to be the case. The locket and the cup were missing from the inventory of her will.\' He sighed. \'I think that is all we need to see of this.'

\'What do you know of the others?\' Harry asked as they left the pensieve.

\'The locket and the cup I have yet to locate for certain.

However, the fifth of his horcruxes, I believe I have found. His control over the serpent Nagini is too great for a simple familiar.\' A slight smile adorned Dumbledore's lips. \'As you have no doubt noticed, I have very little influence over my own.\'

A small chuckle escaped Harry. \'Fawkes does seem a

particularly free spirit.'

\'That he does.\' Dumbledore sent an indulgent smile in the direction of the phoenix and took his seat. \'There will be other horcruxes. Ones I've not yet been able to identify, but I am confident that together we'll be able to discover them from the memories I have of Tom and destroy them.\'

*Locket. Cup. Diadem. Diary. Nagini. Ring.* Harry released a long breath. *I know of all of them. Freedom isn't quite so far away as I feared.*

'We'll continue with this another time, Harry,' Dumbledore said. 'The curse on my hand has not helped my strength and I'm no longer a young man.'

'Of course, sir,\' Harry said, drifting toward the door. 'I hope you\'ll feel better in the morning.'

\'Thank you, Harry.'

Harry made his way down the staircase and back to his bed, tugging the hangings shut around him. Pulling his invisibility cloak from beneath his pillow, he drew the time-turner from within his robes and spun it until it glowed bright and the golden sand faded to fine, black dust.

*Spent, but I got a final three hours out of it, which means past Harry will be in the common room, in full view of at least thirty people, and then with Dumbledore.* Harry closed his eyes as the world blurred backward. *This is the only perfect alibi I will have.* He disillusioned himself, throwing the cloak over his shoulders, and headed down through the evening clamour to Snape's office. *I've destroyed the horcrux Dumbledore hasn't found*. *Dumbledore will locate the two that remain, but he needs to survive to do that.*

Harry abandoned his disillusionment and tucked the cloak away, then knocked on the door to Snape's office. 'Professor? I wanted to ask you a few more questions about the Dark Mark.'

\'Harry,\' Snape drawled as the door swung open. \'Shouldn't

you be with the headmaster soon?\'

*I will be with the headmaster soon*. Harry allowed himself a small smile. *And now time to see if keeping him for my Potions NEWT is worth the risk.*

\'How is the Dark Mark given?\' he asked. \'Are there any restrictions on giving it? Do you have to be of a certain age? Or fairly powerful?\' He pulled his most innocent face. \'Could he give it to someone of my age?\'

\'The Dark Lord marks those of certain value to him,\' Snape said, inviting Harry to take a seat within his office. \'However there are no restrictions save the receiver being magical and knowingly accepting it.\'

A clear glass goblet full of blackberry wine sat on the desk.

'About to have a nice relaxing drink?' Harry asked.

'My one small indulgence,' Snape said, taking a seat. 'Was that all your questions?'

\'Almost,\' Harry leant forward. \'Those that choose to bear it,

they know exactly what it entails and what they've agreed to do?\'

\'They *think* they do,\' Snape said. \'Even if they later realise they were misguided in their belief.\'

\'Either way they are far from innocent,\' Harry replied.

\'There are very few innocents.\' Snape sneered. \'Naivety is common, innocence is not. There are naive Death Eaters and naive Order members, but no innocent ones.\'

\'Least of all those who belong to both,\' Harry said.

Snape\'s lips crooked and nodded. \'I find it hard to believe that was your only reason for coming.\'

\'It was not,\' Harry admitted. \'I find myself with a dilemma. I know a man who wears two faces, who smiles in two directions, lying to both. I am forced to wonder whether such a man can be trusted.\'

\'A promise is only as good as the wizard or witch who makes it,\' Snape replied. \'A man with two faces might as well have three.\'

\'And yet none would be true and none could be trusted.\'

\'As long as he is necessary---\' Snape\'s eyes gleamed with

amusement '---it would not matter.\'

\'And if he became redundant?\' Harry leant back in his chair and found the shrunken glass goblet full of aconite in his pocket. He disillusioned it with a tap of his wand. 'What then?'

\'Then he would find himself crushed between those he

pretended to serve, no matter his true intentions.'

'I suppose, then, that he best ensure he is always more useful alive than dead.' Harry placed the shrunken goblet upon the table and restored it to its original size, keeping his wand in his sleeve. 'Otherwise, it might not end well for him.'

Snape inclined his head, a faint smile on his lips. \'How fare your attempts to win over Slughorn, Harry?\'

'Well enough,' Harry replied. 'I think my constant party attendance has tipped the scales in my favour, so long as I continue to excel in Potions.'

*And I have Hermione's book for that, now.* He vanished the paper sealing the goblet shut and let Fleur's voice well up in the back of his head. *Wipe them all away until it's just us and we're free.*

'That's good.' Snape leant forward. 'Your mother would be proud of your academic success.'

'But not my extra-curricular activities?' Harry quipped. 'I thought I was doing quite well.'

'Your mother was an exceptionally good person, albeit capable of righteous violence if incensed.' Snape sighed and closed his eyes. 'She *was* innocent. Her parents were kind. Her childhood was sweet. She came to the magical world full of wonder and light. I have never met another quite like her.'

*And you got her killed.* Harry stifled a trickle of ice through his veins and switched the goblets, watching the aconite dissolve away and vanishing everything else. *Fleur's right. Not only are you too great a risk to endure, but I owe you oblivion.*

'I do have another question,' he said.

\'Ask away.\' Snape said, opening his eyes.

Harry let a faint smile spread across his face. \'What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\'

\'You\'d be perilously close to the Draught of Living Death.'

\'And what, professor, is the difference between monkshood, and wolfsbane?\' Harry let his smile broaden.

Snape paled a fraction and took a drink of dark blackberry wine. \'None, they are the same plant.\'

\'A poisonous one also known as aconite. I remember you asking me those questions right at the start of the first lesson you gave me, I\'m sure you are glad to know that your students were listening.\'

\'You look like your father,\' Snape murmured, sipping his wine. \'He and I... we did not see eye to eye, even before he married the girl I loved.\' A hollow look hung in his eyes when he met Harry's gaze. \'I have since learnt there's precious little of James Potter about you.\'

Harry studied the level of wine in the glass. \'If I imbued myself with a drop of unicorn\'s blood, amongst other things, can you guess what it might do?\'

*Just a little longer. There's enough aconite in there that it shouldn't take long to act. A single sip is probably more than enough to kill.*

\'Imbued?' Snape's brow creased. 'With the use of some magic the Ministry would be tempted to condemn you to Azkaban for, you'd be immune to most poisons, or any similarly effective spells...\'

\'*I* would be,\' Harry said. \'But imagine, if you will, that I'm sitting in a hall filled with children, the *naive*, if not the *innocent*, and everything that I might touch, could also be touched by them. Now

imagine there's an individual harbouring the malice to spike

everything they can touch with aconite.\'

\'A tragedy might unfold,\' Snape whispered, taking another drink of wine. He glanced at the cup with a faint frown. 'Yet none has.'

'How very fortunate.'

\'Very. I must admit I was concerned, Professor Slughorn expressed some worry over missing ingredients, and I too have found some of my personal supply gone.\' Snape's dark gaze gave nothing away as he sipped his wine.

\'I\'m sure the guilty party will be revealed.' Harry glanced at

the near-empty goblet. 'It won't be long now.'

\'Are you sure?\' Snape asked. 'Things are often less obvious than they seem.'

'Almost always,' Harry murmured. 'Tell me, who is Malfoy really meant to be targeting?'

Snape held his gaze with wide, dilated pupils, running his tongue around the inside of his mouth. 'I'll tell you if you tell me why you haven't killed him.' He wiped beads of sweat off his forehead and dabbed his palms on his thighs. 'Is that a fair enough trade?'

*Your vow...* He hid a smile as Snape sweated and licked his lips, sipping his wine in small gulps. *But the aconite's beginning to take effect.*

'Fair enough.' Harry leant back in his chair. 'I haven't killed him because where he'd fail, you might succeed. Dumbledore said he suspected that he was the target.'

'You know about the vow,' Snape muttered, breathing light and fast. 'You've been using that damn invisibility cloak.'

'It's very useful and not very dangerous.' Harry let out a quiet chuckle. 'Unlike you.'

Snape flinched, then pressed a hand to his chest and snatched his wand out. Harry disarmed him and plucked the wand from the air.

'Aconite,' Snape gasped between shallow, ragged breaths, staring at the goblet. 'A lot of it, to act so fast.' He stumbled from his seat and collapsed to all fours, crawling past Harry's chair, dragging himself onward toward the drawers in the far corner.

Harry spied a section labelled *bezoars* there and turned the whole thing to dust with a tap of his wand.

Snape slumped to the floor. \'Lily\'s eyes were never so cold,\' he whispered.

'You never deserved her,' Harry hissed. 'You should've burnt the world before betraying her!'

A hoarse, faint laugh tore from Snape's throat and he hurled red-spattered vomit up onto the floor. 'Nobody deserved her,' he rasped. 'She was *perfect*.'

*Perfect...* Harry stared down at him, but saw only Fleur's soft

smile and veil of silver hair. *As always.*

'Don't pin this on Draco... he's not lost yet.' Snape rolled over onto his back, gasping for breath in thin wheezes. \'And, Harry... Do better by Fleur... than I did by Lily.' His ribs rose, fell and stilled.

Harry stared down into his blank, dead eyes. 'Well, I could

hardly do *worse,* could I?'

# Under the Lily

Harry sat in the shadows of the Hog's Head beneath his disillusionment charm and watched the crescent moon vanish behind dark clouds. *A beautiful night.* His gaze dropped down to the cross at Hogsmeade's heart. *Give or take that.*

Snape's corpse dangled from the weathered, carved stone, nude and pale but for the blood-soaked rags of his dark robes and the garland of blood-smeared lilies hanging from his neck.

*Still, he deserved it.* Harry crushed the ball of ice tightening in his chest. *You don't betray something perfect. You don't destroy it. You should die before you risk marring it.*

The moon slipped out from behind the clouds; its light gleamed off the frosted cobbles, turning the blood trickling down the steps from the cross as black as ink. Harry stared up at the slim shining crescent --- alone in the dark save for faint starlight and dark clouds, and felt the sharp teeth of the void begin to gnaw at his heart.

'Au revoir.' He tossed the shattered pieces of Snape's wand into the dark pool spreading beneath the dangling corpse and apparated back into the Chamber of Secrets.

*And now to wait for the fallout.* He strode over the bridge, discarding the broken time turner into the pool with a soft splash and sparing a single glance for the outline over the door. *Voldemort will blame me. Dumbledore will blame Voldemort. I shouldn't even be a suspect, given I'm sitting in his office at the moment.*

Harry hurried back through Myrtle's bathroom and slipped into Gryffindor tower, abandoning his invisibility on the stairs to the dormitories.

\'Where have you been sneaking about?\' Hermione demanded, stepping \'round the corner from the girls' dormitory stairs. Dark bags hung under her eyes and she pulled her wand from her pyjamas.

'Speaking with Professor Dumbledore.' Harry eyed her nightwear. 'Are you already going to bed?'

\'Yes.\' She sniffed. 'I'm tired, so I'm taking an early night. I hope you *listened* to Professor Dumbledore, Harry.\'

'I did,' he said, carrying on up the stairs. 'Good night, Hermione.'

Moonlight shone through the curtains of the dormitory, bleaching the red and gold hangings. Silence hung over the room, but distant cheer drifted up the stairs from the common room below.

*How could he ruin something perfect?* He sighed and sat down on the end of his bed, staring at his open palms in the bright moonlight. The melancholy seeped into him like winter cold and the emptiness clawed at his heart with sharp, hollow talons. *And how could he endure living on after there were no dreams left? It would be hell.*

The red and gold closed in on him until his heart began to pound and his breath caught. All the empty space away to the Meadow stretched beyond it, on and on, as far as he could imagine, and all the smothering weight of the castle curled around him.

*I can't stay here.* He jumped to his feet, heart racing beneath his ribs and Fleur's smile swirling through his thoughts. *I have to get out.* Harry closed the curtains around his bed and charmed them shut, then clambered out the window and took a deep breath. The edge of the Forbidden Forest loomed a short distance away, and Fleur's warmth and voice called to him from beyond it.

'Wingardiumleviosa,' he murmured, levitating himself down

to the floor by his robes, and dropping onto the grass.

He ran into the pines, leaping over roots and piles of needles, and wrenched the world past him until he stood in the kitchen. 'Fleur,' he called, poking his head into the lounge. 'Fleur?'

A gentle creak came from above his head and she appeared before him. He breathed in a soft wash of marzipan and drank in the sight of the small smile on her lips and her summer sky blue eyes.

The pounding of his heart slowed and a quiet sigh escaped his lips.

'Are you okay?' Fleur cupped his chin with her fingers. 'Mon

Cœur?'

'I was lonely,' he whispered. 'I killed Snape and dropped his

body in Hogsmeade, but all I could think about was how he ruined something perfect.'

She drew him into her arms and leant her cheek against his.

'I'm here.'

Harry wrapped her up in his embrace and held her tight. 'I don't know how he endured it. All these years, with no dreams left at all.' A tangle of thorns curled around his heart and knotted in his stomach. 'I can barely think about it.'

'Don't think about it,' she murmured. 'Our dream is going nowhere.' She ran her hand up and down his back. 'What happened with Snape?'

'I poisoned him with aconite.' Harry forced himself to think only of the goblet of blackberry wine and nothing else, shoving the emptiness deep down inside. 'I was going to pin the blame on Malfoy, but I didn't think it would work, so I mutilated his body, hung a garland of lilies around his neck and tied him to the cross in

Hogsmeade. Voldemort will think I've killed him for my mother's sake. Dumbledore will think his spy has been discovered.'

'Lily,' Fleur murmured. 'Well, now he can't get in the way of

our dream, at least.'

'I think he wanted to die,' Harry whispered. 'He wanted to destroy Voldemort too, but mostly, I think he just wanted to escape his self-made hell. He said my mother was *perfect.*'

'He got her killed.' Fleur pressed her lips to Harry\'s cheek. 'He's the reason everything that happened to you happened.'

'I know.' He pulled her tight against him and squeezed his eyes shut to blot out the image of Fleur fading into the dark, or vanishing with a bright, burning ring upon her hand. 'I owed him oblivion and he was a danger to us. More than almost anyone else, because he better understood what you mean to me. I just --- I can't find it in myself to hate him. Not knowing what I know. I think I'd be the exact same, eventually. How could death be any worse than a world without you?'

'Gabby told me I'm like the sun to you,' Fleur whispered. 'I could see that being true, monCœur.'

'Gabby is right,' he breathed. 'You're all the warmth and the

light and everything. The only perfect dream in an empty world. Without you, it's cold and dead and dark and I couldn't stand it.' His heart dashed itself against his ribs and his breathing quickened, stirring up the tangle of thorns knotting in his gut. 'It would be *hell*,' he whispered. 'To drift through the world enduring all the meaningless little things left in your absence, feeding whatever bits of me survived to the emptiness until I'm all gone.'

'It's okay.' Fleur led him back to the sofa and eased him

down beside her, wrapping her arms \'round his head and drawing

him down into her lap. 'You're going to spend forever in the sunlight, Harry. I'm here now. I'll be here tomorrow. I'll always be here.

Nothing you can do will lose me. I'm never going to leave.'

He shivered as she ran her fingers through his hair and let the smell of marzipan steady him. 'I keep thinking about how it would feel.'

'There's no need.' Fleur bent and kissed his forehead, tickling his neck with her cascade of silver hair. 'It will never happen. You are mine. And I am yours. Always.'

# Nevermore!

Darkness stretched from Harry's feet. His shadow spread from his toes to drown wildflower fields, white pebbles and willow leaves. A tide of ink-black crept higher and higher, cold as ice, and full of hungry little teeth that tore small chunks from his flesh as the dark crept up his legs.

'Fleur,' he whispered.

Her name echoed over the blackness as it lapped about his

thighs.

'Fleur?' Chill fingers clamped around his heart and he forced

himself to twist about in the stomach-high darkness. 'Fleur?'

A shadow hung above him, soft as summer shade, dancing as if it were cast by candlelight, and growing fainter still.

*She's gone.* Tears leaked from beneath his lashes and trickled down his cheeks. He caught one upon his finger and held it up before his eyes. A droplet of darkness hung from his skin, dripping

into the cold lake as it surged up past Harry's shoulders. *All these*

*tears...*

'Enough to drown in,' Fleur whispered in his ear.

He twisted about.

The shadow faded away above him into nothing and the dark spilt into his mouth, its chill so fierce it burnt the feeling from his tongue.

*She's gone.* Harry closed his eyes and let the black lake swallow him, drifting down into the dark. *There're no dreams left now.*

Fingers curled 'round his shoulder and dragged him deeper.

'Mon Cœur...'

He opened his eyes and found Fleur's summer sky irises a finger's length from his face. 'Fleur...'

'Were you dreaming?' she asked, brushing her silver hair over her shoulder. 'You kept tossing and turning.'

'It wasn't a great dream.' He rested his forehead against hers and sighed. 'I have to go back and think of some excuse as to where I was.'

'I woke you up early,' Fleur said. 'You've got time.'

*I didn't leave through the Chamber of Secrets.* He sat bolt upright and a chill rushed through his veins. *Merde. Dumbledore knows I left the castle...*

'Harry?'

'I wasn't thinking straight when I left last night,' he whispered. 'I didn't sneak out. Dumbledore will know I was away, I've ruined my alibi.'

'Are you sure?' Fleur asked. 'If you're sure, you mustn't go back at all.'

He took a deep breath and ran through the events in his head. 'No... No it's okay. I killed Snape using the time-turner two and a half hours before I met with Dumbledore, when everyone could see me in the common room. I displayed his body in Hogsmeade while I was sitting with Dumbledore. I left after our meeting would've ended.'

Fleur slipped a finger under his chin and tilted his head up to

meet her eyes. 'Are you sure? If there's even the slightest risk...'

'I'm sure.' He mustered a grin. 'Sure enough that it's worth returning. Only Dumbledore will know I left, he'll assume I came to see you and even though the timing is suspicious, my alibi is watertight.' Harry took a deep breath. 'There are six horcruxes, not three. The diary, the diadem, and a ring are all destroyed.

Voldemort's familiar is another.' Ice coursed through his veins. 'And then there's a locket and a goblet. Dumbledore is searching for them.'

She held his gaze with calm, blue eyes. 'It doesn't matter how many there are. We'll find them and destroy them.'

'Dumbledore will find the last two objects or we will.' Harry gathered his faith. 'We can kill the snake when we go after Voldemort, it's always around him.'

'Back you go, then, monCœur.' She pressed a gentle kiss to

his lips. 'The full moon is in a week, I'll see you then. It's not so long.'

*It's far too long.* Harry's heart sank and he caught the same flicker in Fleur's blue eyes. *But only for a little bit longer. Once I've my NEWTs, we never have to do this again.*

'Au revoir,' he murmured and apparated into the fringe of

the Forbidden Forest.

Gryffindor tower's shadow stretched before the dawn to the edge of the trees. Harry transfigured his clothes back into school robes and sprinted across the grass into the school. He crept along empty corridors past sleeping paintings until he reached the snoozing Fat Lady.

'Where have you been?' Hermione descended the staircase from above. 'Sneaking about during curfew?'

'I would never do such a terrible thing,' he replied, noting the mud on her feet. 'But it seems like someone else has been out of bounds this morning. You weren\'t *sneaking,* were you?\'

She flushed and vanished the mud from her shoes. 'I

couldn\'t sleep. Parvati was having another nightmare.\'

\'Still not a good reason.\' Harry shook his head in mock disappointment and tutted. \'You could have been killed, or *worse,* expelled.'

\'You have broken every rule in the school,\' she retorted.

\'Most of them with you beside me.'

Hermione's shoulders sagged. \'They were good times.\' She edged down the steps, lingering on the last. \'I *am* sorry about your wand, you know. I *didn\'t* mean to break it. I know it was really precious to you, I should've just said sorry, but I didn't want you to think I *meant* to and then everything *else* happened.\'

\'I overreacted. Everyone else had already turned against me, it seemed inevitable you would. What\'s done is done. You can't change the past, not unless you've been gifted another time-turner?'

A faint smile crossed Hermione's lips. 'No time-turner. I'm amazed I was given one, actually. I think Dumbledore pulled strings so he had one around just in case it was important. I read up on them because I was curious about the arithmancy and they're *really* bad for you. They put a *lot* of strain on your mind.'

'Hogwarts isn't exactly the safest of schools,' Harry said. 'I would know, I nearly die every year. If I were a suspicious person, I'd wonder if there wasn't some conspiracy going on.' He pried the Fat Lady's portrait open with a wordless confundo and a tug. 'Have you and Ron been stealing from my family's vaults and plotting to murder me?'

'*We* aren't plotting anything.' Hermione trailed him through the passage into the common room. 'I can't say I'm as certain about you, Harry.'

'I was intending to steal your potions textbook,' Harry admitted, taking a seat on the sofa closest to the fire. 'It looked like there was some interesting stuff in there.'

'That's *not* what---\'

Nev stumbled down the stairs, rubbing his eyes and yawning.

\'Morning, Nev,\' Harry called. \'How\'ve you been?\' \'Sleeping,\' Neville replied. \'I have been sleeping.\'

Harry looked all around him, feigning confusion. \'Where\'s Hannah?\'

chair.

\'Too early,\' Nev grumbled, throwing a cushion from a nearby

Harry summoned it into his left hand and dropped it behind

him on the sofa.

\'That\'s cheating.' Nev collapsed into the chair opposite and glanced at Hermione, who scuttled across into the other chair. 'Anything exciting happen yesterday when you were with Dumbledore?\'

\'Not really...\' Harry smothered a small smile. 'Just a long chat in his office. It sent me to sleep so well that I came back and went straight to bed. The only person that turned in earlier than me was Hermione.'

\'Well,\' Nev said. \'If you want excitement, then you need only wait 'til lunch or come back to the DA. We\'re starting to try actual duelling now.\'

\'Oh?\' Harry stifled a flicker of paranoia. 'What's happening at lunch?'

\'It\'s another one of Slughorn\'s parties.\' Nev grinned. \'You get to take Katie, since she has elected herself your platonic date, we get to watch Romilda throw another tantrum, and you have to explain it all to Fleur.\'

\'Fleur doesn\'t mind,\' Harry said.

*She definitely minds. She just prefers the girl she knows.*

\'Doesn\'t she?\' Hermione's eyebrows disappeared into her

hairline.

\'Well.\' Harry grimaced. \'She says that she wants me to take

Katie, but...\'

A silver flamingo accosted Nev, flapping its wings at him and bursting into mist.

\'Breakfast for me,\' Nev said, hopping out of his chair and

heading for the exit. 'Catch you later.'

*Hannah's patronus.*

\'You know,\' Hermione murmured. \'Know what?\'

\'About Katie.\'

\'Katie?\' Harry feigned a deep frown. \'Quidditch player?

Really short, messy hair, terrible sense of humour? No idea.\'

\'You do, don\'t you?!\' Hermione balled her fists and bit her lip. \'And you just let her!\'

\'Let her what?' He let a little ice into his tone. 'Be my friend?

Are you jealous she kept what you threw away?\'

\'No,\' Hermione hissed. \'You let her do everything short of throwing herself at you naked. And for what!? Just to get a thrill of power over her? She'd do *anything---*\'

\'We\'re not having this conversation. My relationships and my friendships are none of your business, and you've only yourself to blame.\'

Hermione huffed, throwing herself from the sofa and stalking out of the common room toward breakfast.

\'What was that about?\' Katie hovered on the stairs.

*Merde.*

\'Nothing important,\' Harry said.

\'Uh huh.\' Katie swallowed. \'So that\'s why I heard my name a handful of times on the way down is it?\'

Harry shot a dark look in the direction of the closing portrait.

*If she knows I know, it could ruin everything.*

\'Not going to tell me, then.\' Her face fell. \'It\'s okay, I can guess what it was about.\'

\'Well, we don\'t need to talk about it if you've already

guessed.\' Harry gestured toward the passage out. \'Breakfast?\'

Katie stared at him. Her shoulders slumped. \'Breakfast,\' she whispered.

*She knows I know.* He watched her bite her nails and trail him through the corridors in the corner of his eye. *It's not going to be the same, now.*

Harry took a seat in the middle of the table and poked the plate of bacon in Katie's direction, casting a covert charm upon it to check for aconite or anything similarly bad for her health. 'Do your worst,' he challenged.

A faint smile passed across her face and she tugged a single slice onto her place, poking it around with the tip of her knife.

'Not hungry?' 'Not really.'

*Katie\...* Harry searched for some words, but all that sprang to mind was the endless dark of the dreamless world. *I'm sorry, wishes like these just almost never come true.*

\'I have project work with McGonagall almost all day today,\' he moaned. 'I thought it would just be the odd thing here and there, but she wants me to change over and over.'

'Change?' Katie glanced up from her plate. 'Change what?' \'Change me. She's researching something to do with the

boundary between human-to-animal self-transfiguration and

animagus changes,\' Harry said.

\'You\'re an *animagus?*\' Katie blurted. 'Since when?'

\'No.\' Harry laughed and shook his head. 'I know my form and can transfigure myself into it with a wand. There\'s a *big* difference. Want to guess what animal?'

Katie plucked her toast off her plate and munched on it.

'Probably something evil. Are you a snake?' 'Nope.'

'Hmmm.' She swallowed a mouthful of toast and brushed crumbs from the corner of her mouth, tugging the bacon plate back across. 'You're right, that's not cool enough. You must be some kind of giant wolf, the alpha of the pack, or a basilisk\...'

'I'm not any kind of snake,' he said. 'And I don't even want to

*know* the logic behind the wolf thing.'

'Oh it's very simple.' Katie beamed and swept a stack of bacon onto her plate. 'You're an apex, alpha, direwolf predator, and

your alpha wolf instincts are the reason you have so many girlfriends.

It's ok to have a harem if you're an alpha wolf animagus.'

'Right\...' Harry rolled his eyes. 'Well, as I'm not a\... whatever wolf, that'd explain my lack of harem.'

'Well if it's not a cool form, then it'll have to be a really cute or embarrassing one,' she said. 'Is it a kitten? Or a snail?'

'Neither of those is even close. You are *terrible* at this.' 'Is it a fish?'

He snorted. 'Why on earth would I be a fish? And what kind

of fish would I even be?'

'A swordfish.' Katie waggled her eyebrows at him, putting her bacon sandwich together with enough ketchup to drown someone in. 'Perfect for slicing through the straps of seashell bras.'

He chuckled. 'Sadly, I'm not any kind of fish.'

She hummed and took a bite of her sandwich. 'Oh!' Katie snapped her fingers and gulped down her mouthful. 'It's something edgy!'

'No it isn't.'

'What's an edgy animal?' Katie mused. 'It's not an edgy animal.'

'Is it a crow?' 'No.'

'A raven.'

Harry raised a finger. 'Ok, yes, it *is* a raven, but that doesn't make it edgy!'

'It's as edgy as it gets.' Katie\'s tone wavered. \'And quite

similar to a crow\...\'

Harry recalled a crow of silver mist bobbing its head around Katie\'s ankles in the Room of Requirement and forced his smile not to slip. \'Yeah, they\'re fairly similar. Crows aren\'t as maligned though, they\'re more mischievous and playful.\'

\'Crows are better. They\'re more fun, and they don\'t eat the intestines of dead things.\'

\'Yes they do,\' Harry said. \'That\'s why they\'ve shorter feathers on their heads, so they can stick their head inside without getting their feathers all messy. If you're a crow animagus, you'll be out there snacking on dead squirrels.\'

Katie pouted and patted at her hair. \'I hope McGonagall

makes you a raven permanently.'

\'No you don\'t.\' Harry grinned. \'I\'d come and fly around your face during quidditch and distract you.\' He ducked as Hedwig swooped down onto the table and deposited a sizable box of crystallised fruit.

\'I would get our new beaters to use you for target practice,\' Katie retorted, inspecting the box. \'They need it.\'

\'Quidditch not going well?\' Harry raised an eyebrow and

shook his head at her. \'It\'s not for you.'

\'Not as well as it used to,\' she confessed. \'We\'re still

winning, but it\'s a bit... *disjointed*, without Angelina and Alicia, and

Fred and George, not to mention our star seeker is still not playing for

his house for reasons only known to him.'

'Someone stole his broom,' Harry muttered.

Katie giggled. \'You\'d need it back to play, wouldn\'t you?\' She

beamed. \'Good thing Ginny\'s pretty good, then.'

\'I\'m never getting that back, am I?\'

\'You can have it back over my dead body.\' Katie scarfed down the rest of her sandwich. \'So, apart from being turned into a bird, what else are you doing?\'

\'Hmmm, let\'s see.\' Harry feigned thought. \'In order of difficulty. Transfiguration project, my NEWTs, hiding from Romilda, enduring Slughorn\'s brunch party, and getting my Firebolt back off you.\'

\'Sounds like a good list. I have nothing to do except quidditch practice this evening, and Charms this morning.\'

\'And Slughorn\'s party,\' Harry said. \'I\'m *not* taking Romilda and Neville is playing hard to get, so that means you have to come and endure it with me.\'

Katie's face lit up with a huge smile . \'You\'re not blonde enough for Neville.' Her face fell a little and she squirmed. \'Wait, Fleur won\'t mind, will she? I don\'t want to cause any trouble.\'

\'I asked her,\' Harry said. 'She'd rather I went with you than anyone else. I think she trusts you not to love potion me or try anything else nefarious.\'

'She does?' Katie narrowed her eyes. 'She didn't strike me as anything other than the extremely jealous type. Did you *actually* ask her or are you just telling me you did?'

'I asked.' Harry studied his fingernails. 'After the last party, I thought I should.'

Katie's lips twisted. 'And she said yes.'

'It was definitely more to do with me not going with someone like Romilda,' Harry replied. 'But you're my best friend, she knows I'm not going to stop spending time with you just because she pouts at me.' A small, soft smile crept onto his lips. 'Especially since it'sa *very* cute pout.'

'I bet you love it,' Katie muttered. 'You go with me and enjoy the party, then you go back to Fleur after she's all wound up and jealous and enjoy the result of that.'

'You know, I'd actually not thought about that.' Harry grinned. 'But now I definitely will. I bet she'll want to keep my attention focused exclusively on her all night. Maybe I can convince her to wear a sea-shell bra.'

'Sea-shell bras are *my* thing. Frenchie has more than enough going for her already.' Katie's brow creased. 'I only have that green dress, by the way, but I can charm it different colours.'

'It\'s fine, come however you want.' Harry shrugged. 'I\'ll transfigure something to match when I see you.'

Katie rolled her eyes. '*Boys.* You should really buy some actual dress robes, Harry.\'

'Fleur\'s parents bought me some.\' He swung himself out from under the bench and plucked his box of crystallised fruit from

the table. 'I think they\'re still in France. I'll meet you at the party, I have to go be a raven for a bit now.'

\'You\'re hopeless.\' She waved him goodbye as he trudged toward McGonagall's office.

Harry wandered through the corridors, watching third year Ravenclaw girls scatter from his path, blushing like mad and whispering to one another. *Right. Luna Lovegood's seduction story. I should probably do something about that, it's only going to encourage the Romildas.* He paused before McGonagall's office and knocked, then opened the door.

'Mr Potter?' McGonagall said. 'You\'re a little late.' 'I was waylaid at breakfast.'

'Try not to let it happen again, Mr Potter. This project will require considerably more effort from myself without your assistance, enough to make it almost untenable.'

'Sorry, professor.'

'Right.' McGonagall strode around the edge of her desk. 'Straight to work, then.'

\'Which bit of me am I changing?\' Harry asked, flicking his wand out and placing the box of sweets beneath the nearest chair.

'I trust, Mr Potter, that you have read the things I asked you

to?'

'I have,\' Harry said. 'It was interesting.'

'In stages, then.' A hint of a smile passed across

McGonagall's face. 'Start with your hair into feathers, then your skin,

then your bones, and onward until you are a raven. I shall observe,

and note the point at which your behaviour changes.' 'Wonderful,' Harry muttered.

The sense of the raven prickled in the back of his mind as ebony feathers sprouted from his skin; its tingle grew stronger and stronger as he changed his skin, his bones, and began to swell through him as he moved onto the soft tissue.

*Bright-thing.* He cocked his head and studied the gleaming round shape on the dead-wood in front of him. *Food?*

'Redeo.' Old-female-two-legs-no-wings jabbed a dead- wood stick at him.

Harry stumbled into the nearest chair and shook off the

raven. 'That's very strange.'

'Biscuit, Mr Potter.' McGonagall waved a tartan-patterned tin under his nose. 'They\'re ginger.'

'Thanks,' Harry selected the least battered looking one and

bit a corner off.

*Probably the safest thing I\'ve eaten in a while.*

'It\'s quite nice,' Harry said, taking a larger bite of the biscuit. 'I'm not a huge fan of ginger, really. Petunia used to drink a lot of elderflower and ginger cordial in summer at her little neighbourhood gatherings.'

'Your aunt.' McGonagall's expression soured. 'I never had the pleasure of meeting her.'

'Don't feel too bad,' Harry quipped. 'It wouldn't have been all that pleasant.'

A soft knock came at the door.

'I\'m not interrupting, am I?' Dumbledore poked his head and

half the length of his beard around the door frame.

McGonagall smiled. 'Not at all, headmaster.'

'Good.' He cracked a wide smile and swept into the room, rubbing his bright-gloved hands together. 'I wanted to see this handsome raven for myself.'

*Of course you did.* Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes. *You're not sure whether I managed to deceive McGonagall, or if I'm genuinely not an animagus.*

'Did you know, Harry,' Dumbledore said. 'That one of the few ways to tell between an animagus and a simple transfiguration is the homenumrevelio spell? It's a little known fact, but that particular revealing charm relies on detecting a similar soul to that of the caster, so it won't show magical animals, but *would* reveal an animagus.'

'Interesting,' Harry said. 'That's a much nicer kind of soul

magic than the others you've told me about.'

'Quite so.' Dumbledore smiled. 'I don't, and no wizard or witch that I am aware of does, exactly understand how, but a full transfiguration into an animal also changes the soul, though an animagus transformation does not. I would hazard a guess it has to do with the perception of self.'

*That's probably a good guess, if it's a guess at all.*

'You could have told me this before, Albus,' McGonagall snapped. 'That would have been a most useful piece of information for this project.'

'Oh.' Dumbledore ran his fingers through his beard. 'I must admit that I had not considered that. Would you like to test it, Minerva?'

*Sure you didn't.* Harry smothered his scepticism before it showed. *And you definitely weren't just saving it to show up and have a reason to see and test my change.*

'Well.' Harry kept his face innocent. 'I can transfigure myself to see if it works, professor?'

'That would be very kind of you, Harry.' Dumbledore pulled his pale, carved wand from his sleeve. 'I would quite like to see this raven that Professor McGonagall mentioned, too. Should you ever find yourself teaching, you will realise that there's a great deal of pride and joy to be taken in the achievements of those under your care.'

*And their sacrifice, in my case.* Harry pushed himself out of the chair, letting the sense of the raven envelop him as he changed.

He hopped onto the dead-wood in front of him, croaking his displeasure at the cold wash of alive-not-alive power and eyeing the shining round thing under his feet, pushing it from side to side with his beak and watching it glitter.

\'Redeo.\'

Harry found himself standing on McGonagall\'s desk. 'Sorry, professor.' He jumped down, catching the bottle cap that had been beneath his foot before it hit the floor. 'What did you see?'

'No red,' Dumbledore mused. 'You would have shown up

red if you were an animagus.\'

'I'm not.' Harry shrugged. 'I don't really have time. I have my NEWTs to study for and then there's that murderous sociopath waiting out there to disrupt my education again.'

'Nobody becomes an animagus after a few weeks, Mr Potter,' McGonagall said. 'It usually takes months.'

Dumbledore sighed and pushed the door to the office closed. 'I must confess I did not come here just to see Harry\'s form. Another Order member has lost their life.'

'Another?' McGonagall sagged into her chair. 'There are not many of us left, Albus.' She pursed her lips. 'You should go, Mr Potter. I think we are done for today in the light of this news.'

'No,' Dumbledore said. 'Harry should stay to hear this, it pertains to him.'

'Who?' McGonagall asked, her face paling. 'Not another of the Weasleys?'

'Severus,' Dumbledore murmured. 'Severus\...' McGonagall blinked. 'But---\'

'Tom finally discovered his deception, it seems. The manner in which his body was found can mean little else.' Dumbledore bowed his head. 'Without him, I fear we are as blind as we were at the start of the first war, and this time Tom is being much more clever.'

'Snape is dead?' Harry asked. 'How?'

'As you know, Professor Snape acted as our spy at great personal risk,' Dumbledore said. 'He died for the one he loved, or, I suppose, he died for her memory and the child she left behind. There

is no death more noble than the sacrifice he has made; it should not

be dismissed.'

*He ruined something perfect.* Harry felt the ice trickle through his blood and close 'round his heart. *A rare, precious, perfect wish. And he destroyed it.*

'It would have been more noble if he hadn\'t betrayed her to die in the first place.' Harry tried to keep the worst of his anger from the words, but it slipped off his tongue like water off glass.

'I\'m sure if he could have died to save your mother, he would have done so without hesitation,' Dumbledore murmured. 'It is not behooving to speak ill of the dead, Harry, especially not of a man so devoted to the woman he loved that he would die for not just her, but her family too.'

*He didn't die for her. He lived to destroy the one that killed her and he died because he didn't really want to live in an empty world.* Harry let his rage fade away into the void beneath. *He hated my existence just as much as he must've been glad to see some part of my mother still existing.*

\'What happened, sir?\' he asked.

'His body was found in Hogsmeade,' Dumbledore said. 'Tom did not let him die easily.'

'He was tortured?' All the blood left McGonagall's face. 'Tom is not kind to those he believes have betrayed him.

There is no other offence he punishes so severely.'

'Poor Severus,' McGonagall whispered.

'I suppose he won\'t be able to redeem himself after all,'

Harry murmured.

'Has he not?' Dumbledore fixed Harry with a long sad look. 'There are few deeds an act like that cannot redeem.' He turned back to McGonagall. 'We are meeting at headquarters, to discuss how we will proceed now that Severus has been lost.'

*Has been lost\... A pawn swept from the board.* Harry stifled a faint smile. *And I almost believed him.*

'I have to attend Professor Slughorn\'s brunch party,' Harry said, pulling his box of sweets out from under the chair. 'Though I assume I wasn't invited anyway, being only adult enough to fight Voldemort and not to talk about it.'

Dumbledore frowned at the box. 'There're better places to

find inspiration to getting permission to take your NEWT early, Harry.'

'Crystallised pineapple, sir?' Harry offered. 'I've found I've developed a bit of a sweet tooth over the last year and a half and usually have something to snack on.'

\'Ah,' Dumbledore murmured. 'My apologies, Harry. Given the context, I'm afraid I jumped to conclusions and wished to help you avoid making a mistake.'

'That\'s ok, sir. It\'s the intent that's important, isn\'t it?'

Dumbledore smiled and nodded his head. 'I try to do everything for good intentions.'

*I\'m sure you do.* Harry swallowed a bitter taste and a touch of cold wrath. *I shall see you on the road to hell, Dumbledore.*

He left McGonagall\'s office and hurried toward Slughorn's brunch party, side-stepping a gaggle of first year boys chasing an enchanted paper aeroplane, and pausing before the door to Slughorn's lab.

'You\'re early, Harry.' Slughorn trundled down the corridor and fumbled his key into the door, leading Harry into the room. 'That's an interesting looking box you have there. A present for your date?'

'A gift for you, sir.' He hid a small smile and set the box down on the desk. 'I heard that it\'s your favourite.'

Slughorn laughed and patted his belly. \'You spoil this old man. You were quite right that it\'s my favourite---\' his hand froze over the box \'---you didn't have a question, did you\...?'

Harry leant on the back of the chair. 'I just wondered if you\'d put any thought into letting me take my NEWT early.'

'Well\...' Slughorn let out a little sigh. 'Nothing dark about

that.\'

'Dark, sir?' Harry stifled a laugh.

'Don\'t worry, m\'boy!' Slughorn clapped his hands together.

'I\'ll write your note this evening.'

*And four out of four.* Harry squashed the flash of triumph.

*Nearly free.*

'Thank you, sir.' He grinned. 'I need to get changed. If you\'ll excuse me?'

'Of course, Harry! Can\'t come to one of my parties dressed in school robes, what would Miss Bell think?\' His eyes turned sly and

his fingers drifted to tug at his moustache. \'Or should that be Miss

Delacour?'

'No girl could ever condone such terrible form from their

date.'

'Indeed not.' Slughorn\'s fingers dropped back to his side.

'Off you go then!'

Katie lingered outside in blue and silver, shuffling her feet and studying the background of the painting of a witch wearing an opulent silk dress. A faint smile flitted across her lips as she caught sight of Harry and she twirled. 'I made it blue and silver,' she whispered. 'I thought that it was the best choice.'

*Katie\...* A little pang tore through Harry's chest. *Why would you do that to yourself?*

'It looks nice,' Harry murmured, wrapping her up into a hug.

'I hope you didn't have to kill Romilda?\'

Katie giggled and curled her fingers into his robes. 'Romilda was quite cross. I think she hoped to catch you before I was around to fend her off, but apparition classes are very close to here, so I had a head start.\'

'Damn.' Harry slipped out of her embrace and transfigured his robes to match hers. 'And I was so hoping to spend the party with her.'

'She\'s not so bad, really.' Katie's smile wavered. 'Of course, she doesn't know anything about you other than you're vaguely attractive and famous.'

'Better than the other sort.' Harry grinned. 'The ones that have a copy of our article on their bedroom walls beside the handcuffs are the ones that worry me.'

Other couples drifted past them into the room.

'Shall we go in?' Katie suggested. 'I\'m hungry.'

'You should've eaten more breakfast,' he scolded. 'Some girl once told me it was the most important meal of the day, but then she stole all the bacon, so I'm not sure I should trust her.'

'Sounds like that girl knew what she was talking about.' Katie laughed and perused the plates, pausing before a dish of sugar-dusted fruit pastries.

Harry caught her hand as she reached to grab one. 'Not before everyone's here, bacon thief.'

'Spoilsport.' Her fingers lingered in Harry's and she squirmed, refusing to meet his eyes. 'Those looked good.'

*Katie\...* He took a deep breath and eased his hand out of her grip, looping it through Katie's arm instead. *I almost wish I didn't know.*

Across from them, Malfoy caught Harry's eye and raised his goblet in a mocking toast, inclining his head. 'You missed Defence Against the Dark Arts, Potter.' He sneered. 'Couldn't face it?'

'Forgot about it, actually.' Harry leant back in his chair and returned Astoria's wave with a brief smile. 'Some of us are good enough not to have to worry, I suppose.'

'You'll get yours, Potter.' Malfoy glowered, then turned

away to mutter to Pansy Parkinson.

*I'm going to make sure of it.* Harry smiled to himself and sipped his glass of water. *My perfect wish.*

# Porcelain Perfection

Pink paper decorations and lacy white bunting hung in the windows of Madam Puddifoot's. A handful of couples sat upon pink cushions and chairs over little white teacups and teapots. The light of the sunset gilded the china pink and orange.

*Tasteless.* Fleur turned her nose up.

'Last time I was here, it was Valentine\'s day,' she said. Katie laughed. 'Who did you go with?'

'I did not go in.' Fleur shuddered. 'This was when Harry was

moping.'

Harry shot her a betrayed look.

*Sorry, monCœur, but you were.* Fleur smirked at him and

pressed a kiss to his cheek. *I had to trap you in France.*

Neville sniggered. 'Moping, Harry? What happened to just asking her to Hogsmeade?'

'It's a long way to Hogsmeade from France.' Harry gave Fleur's fingers a gentle squeeze.

'You weren't in France,' Neville said. 'You were right here.' 'And I had a tournament of death to worry about.' Harry

raised his finger. 'Which I won.'

Katie grabbed Harry's other arm and tugged him into

Honeyduke's.

Fleur frowned at Katie's gentle grip on Harry's wrist. *Are you testing my reaction now you know I know?* She released Harry's hand and paused to rummage through the shelf of sweet crystals, one eye on Katie's reflection in the window.

'Some of these, I think.' Katie pulled boxes of Firewhiskey chocolates from the stack at the end of the aisle and thrust them at Harry.

'Nope. I'm not your keeper.' He sidestepped and they ended up in Neville's arms. 'Nev can look after you, I'm probably going to have more than enough to carry as it is. Fleur in a sweets shop is more dangerous than a dementor in a primary school.'

Fleur smiled and placed her armful of sugar crystals in his

hands. 'Hold these, monCœur.'

'See.' He weighed the sugar crystals. 'That's actually not that much, is this it?'

'Gabby brought me cake from home,' Fleur murmured in his ear. 'So I don't need lots.'

Neville disappeared beneath a metre-high animated chocolate bowtruckle, wrestling with a dozen limbs as it pried its way free of the box.

'Don't let it get away,' Katie ordered. 'I want to eat it.'

Harry sent the bowtruckle back into its packaging with a flick of his wand.

'It\'s worse than Trevor,\' Neville groaned. 'Are you sure you want this, Katie?'

Katie beamed. 'I\'m going to eat it alive.'

'We should move on,' Harry said. 'Nev\'s gran will come to apparate him back home for Christmas soon.'

'She's still apparating at her age?\' Katie enquired. 'Really?' 'There\'s not much that will stop Gran,\' Nev replied. 'We do

need to move on to the Three Broomsticks if we\'re ever going to have

this talk Harry\'s been promising all morning.'

Katie's gaze lighted upon the free samples. 'Or we could have it here\...'

Fleur glanced up and down the aisles. 'There\'s nobody else

in this part of the shop.'

'See.' Katie helped herself to all the oval-shaped samples.

'Fleur knows better than to pass up free sweets.'

'She also has better sense than to eat all of the alcoholic ones,' Harry remarked, plucking the last couple out of Katie's fingers and replacing them. 'You need help.' He glanced at Fleur.

*A ward.* She threw up a bubble of magic to suppress the sound of their conversation. *Easy.*

'So, you know I'm doing my NEWTs early, right?' Harry stacked Fleur's sugar crystals on the counter on top of Katie's box of chocolates and the bowtruckle. 'I'm doing them in January, if things go to plan.'

'Without doing *any* studying,' Katie muttered. 'It's outrageous.'

Harry chuckled. 'I did my studying over the summer. Fleur

kept trying to distract me.'

Fleur laughed. 'You kept *begging* me to distract you.'

'Liar.' Harry grinned. 'I would never do such a thing.'

'So what?' Neville asked. 'You're just going to do Advanced Arithmancy afterward?'

'I'm going to leave,' Harry murmured. 'When my NEWTs are done, I'm going to go home to Fleur.'

Katie's last chocolate slipped through her fingers. 'Leave?' Her voice wavered. 'But---'

'Maybe not straight away,' Harry said. 'But I won't stay

long.'

Neville shrugged. 'Fair enough, I guess. Are you going to

help Dumbledore fight?'

'I'm going to fight.' A small smile crossed Harry's face. 'If you need me, send your patronus. I'll come back as soon as I can. The same over the Christmas holidays, Nev. If you're attacked, I'll come. I need to hunt down the remaining members of Voldemort's inner circle and\... *talk\...* to them.'

Nev flinched, then drew himself up. 'It's one thing to stop them doing more harm, Harry, but you can't *torture* them.'

\'Torture?\' Harry raised an eyebrow. \'I\'m going to use legilimency, Nev, not the Cruciatus Curse. It\'s what I did to help you learn Occlumency.\'

\'Oh.\' Neville shrank back. 'Sorry,' he whispered. 'I just

thought---\'

'You thought he would torture people?' Katie rounded on Neville. 'Are you insane?'

'I\'m sorry,' Neville said. 'What else was I to think?'

'You should know me better,' Harry murmured. 'I do what I have to, that's all.' A bright smile spread across his face. 'It's okay, don't worry about it, Nev.'

Fleur scowled and reached for Harry's shoulder. Her fingers brushed Katie\'s; she snatched her hand away and squirmed as Fleur gave Harry's shoulder a soft squeeze.

*He's mine.* Fleur levelled a long stare at her. *You can dream*

*and hope, but he's out of your reach. I'll never let him go.*

'I need to go,' Neville said. 'Gran's probably waiting for me.'

*And it's nearly dusk.* Fleur glanced at the darkening sky. *The full moon is tonight.*

'I'll see you after Christmas, Nev,' Harry said.

'See you, mate.' Nev waved a hand at Katie and Fleur, then

hurried from the shop.

'You can come and visit me whenever, Harry.' Katie beamed. 'You know where the café is.'

'You\'re safer here,' Harry said. 'Voldemort will go after you if he gets the chance. Stay here for Christmas.' He poked Katie in the side. 'Besides, I'm leaving soon, you ought to stick about while I'm still around.'

*Mon Cœur.* Fleur shot him a glare out of the corner of her

eye.

Harry gave her a small, helpless shrug. 'Katie?' 'I'll stay,' she blurted. 'I promise.'

*Of course you will.* Fleur buried a flash of heat and ignored the prickle of feathers just beneath her skin. *Even now, you still hope to steal him.*

'We\'d best go,' she said, glancing up at the sky.

Harry nodded and counted out a handful of sickles and galleons. 'We should.' He patted Katie's stack of chocolates. 'There you go, payback for that time we abandoned your café without paying.'

Katie pouted. 'Ditching your third wheel already?' She shook the bowtruckle in the box and giggled when it shook its chocolate fists at her. 'Ah well, I've got this not-so-little guy instead. I'll see you soon!'

'Au revoir, Katie.' Fleur took Harry's hand, apparating into their kitchen to grab the silver mask she'd enchanted, then onto the scree slopes of the Lake District.

Harry stumbled forward, then caught himself just before

toppling down the hill. 'Could've warned me.'

'That's for encouraging her,' Fleur said. 'Using yourself as a bribe to get her to stay at Hogwarts\...' She let the heat curl back up and her eyes darken. 'Katie still wants to steal you. I don't like it when you give her hope.'

'I want her to be safe,' Harry replied, glancing up at the faint outline of the full moon as the last light of the sun faded. 'She's never going to take me away from you, but she's still my best friend. I'd be upset if anything happened to her. Very upset.'

Fleur sighed and slipped her fingers through his. 'I know. I just don't like the way she's all over you. I'm the only girl I want to be that close to you.'

'What about Gabby?' Harry shot her a grin. 'I did promise that when she went through her veela majority I'd help her, even if it led to us becoming veelabondmates and being trapped into veela threesomes by the whimsical laws of magical romances.'

Fleur laughed. 'Gabby gets a pass.'

'Awesome.' He chuckled. 'I can tick veela threesome off my

bucket list, then.'

'No you can't.' She let a pout creep onto her face. 'Not

unless it involves a time-turner and two of me.'

Harry cocked his head. 'Now that *is* a thought. Salazar did want me to experiment with a time-turner and I honestly can't think of any better way than that.'

'Something for you to look forward to.'

'Definitely.' A glimmer of mischief hovered in his eyes. 'Worst case scenario, we get stuck in a time loop having that threesome forever. I could live with that.'

Fleur sniffed. 'There is virtually no chance of that happening. You'd have to deliberately mess with the enchantments on the time- turner to manage that.'

Harry grinned. 'And, just out of curiosity, how would I do

that?'

She gave him a sweet smile. 'You will never know.' 'Siren,' he accused. 'I know your inherent sex-magic bird

nature means you'd really like it.'

'At least I can manage a proper beak without hopping

around the room like an excited budgie and trying to grab anything

shiny --- usually my hair.' Fleur glanced up at the bright moon. 'I think we've waited long enough, monCœur.'

He sighed. 'Yes, I think so.'

Fleur raised the mask and rearranged the patterns to activate the portkey. 'Now we just have to wait for him to say the word, but given the word I chose, it shouldn't be long. Anything he or his magic is touching will come with him when he does, but together, we'll be more than able to handle him.'

'Okay,' Harry said. 'What word---'

A loud crack echoed through the dusk. Dark shadows thudded into the scree and spilt down the slope, sending shale slithering and scraping toward the gleaming lake below.

Harry took a deep breath and levelled his wand at the glimmer of silver beneath the hood of the standing figure.

The clouds slid past the bright moon.

Tangled blonde-hair tumbled over milk-white skin, pale lips, and blank blue eyes. Twenty corpses sprawled over the scree, cold and still as stone.

Fleur's heart stopped. *They look like Gabby.*

'Potter.' The dark-robed figure above them held his wand between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand like it were a paintbrush and twirled it in a circle. 'I will not make the same mistake as my fellows. This is not quite the spell I intended for you, my beauties, but I have no choice.'

The corpses of the girls jerked and spasmed, then dragged themselves upright, clawing at the scree with torn, pink-varnished

nails. Smeared lip gloss glittered on snarling lips about bared little white teeth. Bright-coloured bracelets hung on slim, dark-veined, pale-skinned wrists.

Travers's eyeholes fixed themselves upon Fleur. 'You're a little older than I normally would like,\' he muttered, the fingers of his right hand groping at the air. 'But you will make a fabulous addition all the same.' Desire seeped from beneath the silver mask and hung hot and heavy in his loud rasping breaths. 'When your skin is cold as porcelain, your eyes bright with death, I will make you mine. You will serve at my side until your perfection's tainted by time or you no longer please me.'

Harry's wand snapped up, unleashing a gout of water up the incline. Spears of ice lanced from the floor as the water splashed upon the stones, impaling the girls that hurled themselves down the slope. They tore free, ripping off limbs and wriggling through, lunging forward.

Fleur reached for the fire within and hurled a glob of blue flame at the first inferius to break free of Harry's ice. It staggered as the fire burst across its chest, then threw itself forward, trailing a blazing mane of hair, stumbling to a halt as the muscles and tendons burnt away. She banished it back up the slope, leaving nothing but a line of smoke and the reek of seared flesh and scorched hair.

Harry flicked his wand, sending a thin ribbon of purple fire slicing across the scree. Half a dozen inferii vanished beneath it, crumbling to ash, and the ice exploded in a rush of steam. A bright hail of curses hissed toward him, but Harry swatted them aside with a contemptuous flick of his wand and hurled a bright pinprick of silver light back through the steam.

A bright flash burst beyond, throwing the sharp shadows of young girls up against the steam. Travers let out a raw cry.

An inferius lunged through the white cloud. Fleur flinched and blasted it to pieces with an instinctive jab of her wand. The pieces glowed an eerie yellow and dragged themselves back together. Thick, raw, red lines stretched across the girl's face and limbs and the stub of her tongue stuck from between her gloss- smeared lower lip and the gaping hole stretching up to the bare, ragged cartilage of her nose.

The torso of a girl no older than eleven clawed its way uphill on her right, snapping at her calf. Fleur kicked its head away and set it alight with a swish of her wand, letting the fire in her bones bubble up to the surface and bathing her left palm in azure flame.

Travers howled within the fading steam and a bright flash

of green burst into a wisp of dark mist before Harry's chest. 'Enough,' Harry said.

A cloud of black butterflies burst from his wand tip, streaming around him and Fleur in a circle. He flicked his wand and they scattered from the swarm, streaking out to alight upon the remaining inferii. The little girls crumbled to dust.

'No,' Travers moaned. 'You destroyed *all* of them.' A choked sob echoed from beneath the silver mask. 'My precious collection\...'

'You disgust me,' Harry snapped.

'Imperio!' Travers cried, directing his wand at the insects

around Harry.

One small, black butterfly broke from the cloud, floating to burst against his chest with a small puff of ebony mist.

Harry laughed. 'That's not how that piece of magic works.'

'Fine,' Travers hissed. 'Taste the beauty of everlasting death; the perfection in which I will keep you and her until I am tired of you, or until your flesh has worn out too much to be of service to me.' He thrust his short wand at the scree.

Shale crawled together, slithering and scraping into a great shivering cairn, then bursting into a great stone serpent.

'Contusio.' Harry shattered the crude snake with an ear- splitting concussion and flash of bright light.

Sharp shards of slate sprayed off into the night.

Fleur threw up a shield and watched the bits of stone bounce away. A metallic ping echoed through the dusk and Travers ran the edge of his thumb along the bright groove in his silver mask.

The gravel swirled together into a rumbling mound, then coiled back into the form of a snake and lunged at Fleur. She cast a shield and watched it wrap itself around the outside, crushing the light of her shield inward.

*A battering ram of a spell. Force is useless.* Fleur slipped her magic into the threads of power that tied the stone serpent together, stripping away Travers's enchantments and rebinding the snake to her own will. It collapsed, writhing, and Fleur abandoned her shield, sending the gravel creation up the slope.

Stray spells batted aside by Harry and Travers bored smoking holes into the dirt and left dark, angry scorch marks on the stones. Her stone serpent lunged straight into a gush of cherry-red flame and burst into molten rock, spattering across the scree. Her magic melted away beneath the torrent of fire like snow from boiling water.

Smoking tears scattered Travers's robes and dark spots marked the ground beneath his feet. His breath came in hoarse, light gasps. 'Avada kedavra,' he spat, hurling a viridescent beam at Harry.

Harry side-stepped, his wand crackling with white sparks

and giving off a strong tang of ozone. 'Fulminis.'

A crackling bolt of lightning flashed from his wand's tip, leaving a smoking hole the size of Fleur\'s hand in Travers's stomach and a web of raw, weeping burns. The short wand in Travers's hand exploded into splinters.

'Kill me then, Potter,' Travers rasped. 'Make me as beautiful as my girls were. Let pale, cold hands caress away my fears, feelings and future.'

Harry thrust out his hand and ripped the spell-scarred, silver mask off Travers's face. A pale sneer twisted a matted tangle of ginger stubble and pale green eyes into ugliness.

Fleur strode up the slope and rested a hand on his shoulder. 'He's good enough to know things,' she murmured. 'Perhaps one of these other horcruxes Dumbledore has identified is in his keeping.'

Harry nodded and pointed his wand between Travers\'s

eyes. 'Legilimens.'

Silence hung upon the night as Travers's face twisted into a

grimace, then spread into a broad grin.

Unease gripped Fleur. *Is he good at mind magic, too?*

A small smile curved Harry's lips and he dropped Travers to the ground. 'Bellatrix Lestrange. Voldemort entrusted one of them to her, her husband and his brother, the cup that Dumbledore

discovered, and she placed it in the safest location she knew, her

vault at Gringotts.'

Travers let out a low moan. 'Kill me,' he pleaded. 'Make me as perfect as they were, with white, cold skin, bright, brittle hair, and such wonderful, blank eyes. I want to be as I made them, my porcelain people.'

'You can rot here,' Fleur retorted. 'They'll never find you. Your flesh will be picked clean by crows and rats and smothered in mould.'

Travers flinched and his breath caught. 'No!' He fell to his knees. 'I don't want to rot! I don't want to change! Don't let me change!'

face.

'Then you can burn.' Fleur cast a fistful of blue fire into his

Travers screamed and writhed on the ground, clutching at

his face and kicking his heels into the stones. The fire lit his robes, wrapping him up in a veil of flame, and his screams and spasms faded to stillness. A thick column of black smoke drifted off into the night.

Fleur wrinkled her nose at the stink of burning flesh. 'Let's go home, monCœur.'

Harry slipped an arm around her waist and tugged her tight

against him. 'Let's.'

# Sole Survivor

A slim, warm arm slipped around his shoulders. Harry opened his eyes and received a faceful of silver-blonde hair as Fleur tucked her head into his collarbone.

'It\'s cold,' she moaned into his neck, snuggling against him. 'I'm cold.'

Spiralling patterns of frost spread across the window and a stiff breeze buffeted the long grass in the meadows.

'I\'m sure there's some way to enchant the walls and windows to retain the heat better,' Harry said, smoothing her hair out of her eyes. 'No?'

'Dangerous,' Fleur mumbled, tucking her ice cold feet into his legs. 'You can destroy your house in any number of interesting ways if you make even a small mistake. Big risk of a fire.'

'Speaking of fire.' Harry smiled down at the bundle of silver hair tucked under his chin. 'I\'m sure there are easier ways to warm your feet.'

'I like this way,' Fleur said. 'It is nice to have you here warming up the bed again.'

'I feel so appreciated.' Harry grinned and kissed her on the

top of her head.

'You *know* you\'re appreciated.' Fleur leant her head back and shot him a sultry smirk from beneath her lashes. Her fingers traced their way down Harry\'s stomach, leaving light, hot lines as they trailed lower and lower.

The wards thrummed and her fingers flinched away.

'I\'ll see who it is.' Harry snatched his wand from beneath the

pillow and conjured himself a set of simple dark robes from the air.

'Nobody's meant to be visiting today,\' Fleur whispered, scrambling for her clothes on the opposite side of the bed. 'Sirius and the rest of the Order have been fighting 'round the clock.'

Harry crept along the landing and peered out the small window on the stairs. A silver gryphon paced the edge of the Unyielding Shield Charm, clawing at the ground and shaking its head. 'It's a patronus. Sirius's, probably, unless Gabby loves gryphons?'

'Gabby's patronus is probably a smutty book,' Fleur called back. 'Or some kind of made up veelavalkyrie.'

'I'll go out and see whose it is,' Harry said. 'Get ready, just in case it's a trap.'

He apparated out to the edge of the wards and peered into

the trees. 'Alright, then.' He edged out of the wards.

'Harry.' Sirius's voice emanated from the silver gryphon. 'Come to Azkaban. Come fast. It's all gone wrong.'

His blood ran cold. *Fleur's going to kill me for disappearing off without her.* Harry flicked his wand at the house and set his anzupatronus soaring toward their bedroom and took a deep breath. *But I can't take her with me, not if it's going to be dangerous. If Voldemort sees her, he'll try to take her away, just to see what I'll do.* He pictured the images of Azkaban he'd glimpsed in Jugson's head and wrenched the world back past him.

The tower of Azkaban loomed over dark stone. Black water crashed upon whelk-studded, kelp-draped rocks as the sea swirled

and surged around the island. Smoke rose from scorched craters, mingling with the salt-scented spray of the sea, and spells flashed back and forth between the tower and the low, domed building clinging to the cliff face above the waves. A ring of dark-robed figures hurled curses at the tower from behind a shield of shining, silver serpents and mounds of bodies. Scattered red-robed hit wizards returned fire from behind the ground floor windows, ducking and darting about inside.

*Merde. Voldemort.* Harry disillusioned himself and apparated down to a spur of rock overhanging the conflict, ignoring the cluster of dark-robed bodies upon it. *At least he's lost a lot of followers.*

A handful of huge figures sprawled upon the rocks beneath the dome, shuddering with the waves and dying the white foam red as it washed past them.

*Dead giants. Dead Death Eaters. Dead hit-wizards.*

Voldemort's shield vanished for an instant and the Dark Mark exploded above the domed building, sending eerie green light flickering across the sky as the smoke drew together into a serpent and skull. Screams echoed from within Azkaban.

*He had people inside.* Harry's breath caught and he clenched his fists, watching little flashes of silver through windows of the tower's upper levels. *No. Not people. The dementors.*

The hail of curses showering down from the tower thinned and faded away with a series of loud cracks, then a swarm of skeletal figures burst from within the tower and poured into the windows of the lower levels. Voldemort's shield vanished and he thrust his wand in the air, sending out a ripple of magic; it settled over the entire island.

*Wards\... Merde. Where's Sirius?* Harry cursed and peered across the field, searching for someone not in red amongst the huddle of hit-wizards that now hurled themselves toward the domed-building and away from Azkaban's tower.

The crowd of red dwindled as Death Eaters apparated past them and threw spells from all directions. Bodies tumbled to the ground, red and black-robed.

'Black!' A dark-robed figure in a half-warped silver mask began a furious assault upon a red-robed wizard near the front.

*There. Malfoy's found him.* Harry reached out to test the strength of Voldemort's wards and grimaced. *Not getting through those easily.*

A gush of purple flame swept past Malfoy, immolating a handful of Death Eaters behind him. Malfoy disappeared with a loud crack and reappeared down by the sea, standing amidst the spray. Sirius gave chase as the swarm of dementors exploded out of the upper levels of the tower and swooped down upon the hit-wizards.

*Where's the snake?* Harry scanned the rocks. *No sign of it.*

*Merde.*

'Alastor Moody.' Voldemort strode out into the open,

swatting aside a couple of spells. 'There's no escape. Death comes to embrace you.'

The dementors drifted back.

Moody stood alone above a mound of red-robed corpses. 'You gigantic cunt! I'm going to take a piece of you with me. More than one, if I can fucking manage it!'

Voldemort circled the grizzled auror, his robes whispering over the corpses. 'You will have to *take* your pound of flesh. Come and see if you're able to land a single spell on me. Nobody will interfere.' A cold grin curved his lips. 'There's nobody left to interfere for you\...'

Moody snarled and jabbed his wand at Voldemort, slashing and lashing it back and forth, sending spells of all colours hissing through the air. Voldemort flicked them all away, striding forward faster than Moody could limp back, unleashing a hail of his own spells. Moody deflected some, then threw up his shield, but the burning orange spells punched through the glowing silver light, shattering Moody's fake leg and a bright whip of green flame snaked from the end of Voldemort's wand, severing Moody's hand.

'Pitiful.' Voldemort crunched Moody's wand beneath his heel. 'I expected more.'

'Fuck you.' Moody let out a groan.

Voldemort thrust his wand out, twisting his wrist like he was unlocking a door. Moody writhed, then his skull and spinal column ripped themselves out of his back in a spray of crimson and he flopped to the ground.

The gleaming ivory skull and spine hovered in the air, dripping thick red down onto the blood-stained, scorched stone.

'Victory,' Voldemort declared, tossing Moody's remnants aside. 'Amelia Bones and the few remaining hit-wizards have fled back to London. We will finish them soon.' He crooked a finger at the dementors and pointed down to where Sirius and Malfoy staggered about on the rocks, grappling with one another through the crash of the waves. 'Deal with the last one.'

Two dementors swooped away down to the shoreline and the snake slithered from among the Death Eaters to swallow Moody's corpse.

*The snake will have to wait.*

Harry apparated down onto the rocks and slipped his wand from his sleeve. 'Expectopatronum,' he whispered, pouring a thick veil of silver mist out between the dementors and the island. He kept it up as he picked his way across the rocks, keeping one eye on the growing number of floating shadows hurling themselves against his patronus.

Malfoy shoved Sirius back off the rock and snatched a wand

out of his robes. 'Tristis Cancro,' he hissed.

A bolt of teal light hit Sirius in the ribs, tearing a grunt from his lips. 'That barely scratched me, Lucy. Do you have a little blue potion you'd like to take before we keep going?'

Malfoy pulled the silver mask from his face and sneered down at Sirius with charred lips and a twisted mass of scarred flesh. 'You're dead, Black. And your family dies with you.' He froze, grabbing at his forearm. 'Good riddance.'

Harry glanced at the swarm of dementors behind him and jumped across to Malfoy's rock, kicking him down into the sea. 'Time to go home, Sirius,' he quipped, abandoning his disillusionment.

Sirius sagged onto the rocks. 'You're going to have to carry

me.'

Harry watched Malfoy flounder in the waves, clawing his

way up the rock, and grabbed Sirius's arm, gathering all his magic. 'You better hope I can break those wards or we're not going anywhere.' He abandoned his patronus and wrenched at the bubble

of magic, crushing it down until the world whirled past him and they staggered across the kitchen floor at the meadow.

Sirius sprawled onto the tiles, caked in blood, mud and worse, dripping water.

Fleur appeared, her eyes black as ink. 'We're going to have a *long* talk later,' she hissed at Harry, tugging her wand from her waist and running it over Sirius's injuries one at a time.

Guilt stabbed at Harry. 'Fair enough,' he murmured. 'What happened?' Fleur demanded.

'Voldemort went for Azkaban.' Sirius dragged himself into a chair. 'Scores of his followers died taking the harbour and so did a bunch of giants and werewolves. It\'s the only place you can magically travel to or from on Azkaban, and even then only by a portkey authorised by the Ministry.'

'They had another spy, then?' Harry asked.

'Yes.' Sirius stared at his hands, brushing grime from the worst of the scratches. 'Voldemort and what's left of his inner circle punched through our counter-attack just when we thought we'd gained the upper hand. He killed Dawlish and Scrimgeour himself, and tore apart the rest of the aurors who were leading the charge. After that, we tried to hold the tower and let his forces dash themselves against the walls. It was working until the fucking dementors betrayed us.' He sighed. 'I take it Moody didn't make it?'

Harry shook his head. 'Voldemort ripped his spine out.' Fleur winced. 'Did anyone escape?'

Sirius shrugged. 'I think some got out before the dementors

got them and the wards went up.'

'Amelia Bones got away,' Harry said. 'I don't know about anyone else.'

*Katie\'s father was stationed in London, so at least he's still*

*fine.*

Fleur let out a little hiss and tugged Sirius's tattered robes

away from his ribs. A dark, crescent-shaped cut oozed thick, yellow

pus down his side. 'What is this?'

'It looks worse than it is,' Sirius said. 'It's just a small cut.' 'What spell was it?' Fleur poked the inflamed flesh around it

with the tip of her wand. 'There's still magic in the wound.' She tugged Sirius's robes down to his waist and traced swollen, dark veins down his side.

'No idea.' Sirius winced and squirmed as Fleur prodded at the cut. 'You know that hurts, right?'

She ignored him. 'I can't stop the curse spreading by just taking it apart, whoever cast it intended the magic to kill you slowly. I can fix it, but it won\'t heal for at least a month or two as the rest of the magic in you fades away.'

'A small price to pay.' Sirius shrugged. 'Do it.'

'This will hurt. A lot.' Fleur pressed all five of her fingertips into the flesh around the wound and pinched, squeezing out a gush of red-tinged, yellow pus. Sirius clenched his jaw and ground his heels into the tiles. She tightened her fingers until they went white and the trickle of pus slowed.

'That wasn\'t so bad,' Sirius said, gritting his teeth.

'I haven\'t done it yet.' Fleur raised her other hand and

conjured a small blue flame on the tip of her finger.

'Shit.' Harry\'s godfather paled and swallowed hard. 'Just don't get the face. I'm finally prettier than Lucy is, don't ruin my chance to gloat.'

Fleur thrust the tip of her finger inside the wound and held it there. Sirius writhed, sweating and twisting in the chair.

'Done.' She pulled her hand back and stepped over to the sink to wash it. 'That curse would've rotted you from the inside out over the next week if I'd not burnt away all the flesh affected by it.'

'Will it have any permanent effect?' Harry studied the blackened, burnt flesh and web of grey veins. 'It looks bad.'

'He\'s not going to be up to duelling anyone for a month or two,' she said. 'And when it's healed as well as it ever will, he'll find the scar and the damage to his muscles will affect his movement.'

'Doesn't much matter,' Sirius whispered. 'I\'m the last.

Moony\'s gone. Greyback tore him apart for interfering with the packs.

He bragged about it at Azkaban.'

'We\'ll get Greyback,' Harry promised.

'I\'ll get him,' Sirius said. 'You need to find those horcruxes. There\'s not much of the Ministry left now, certainly not enough to stop a determined attack should Voldemort throw his full strength into it, and the Order is gone. It\'s just me, Minerva, Filius, the Weasleys, and Dumbledore left. We\'re almost out of time.'

A cold shiver ran down Harry\'s spine. *The locket. The cup.*

*Nagini.We need to go to Gringotts as soon as possible.*

Harry shared a long look with Fleur. 'Go get some rest,

Sirius.'

Fleur cocked her head and waited until Sirius's steps faded

away toward the spare bedroom, then snatched Harry's arm and dragged him into her arms. 'Idiot,' she hissed, her eyes flashing pitch black. 'You run off like that again, monCœur, and I will go back to France!'

Harry's heart seized and the world ground to a halt. He stared into her huge, dark eyes as everything began to spin, swirling 'round his head in a whirl of dizzying lightness.

The room lurched sideways.

'Breathe!' Fleur shook him.

He sucked in a gulp of air and groped for the edge of the table. A fist of panic clamped about his throat, hot as flame. 'Don't go,' he gasped. 'Don't leave.'

Fleur's eyes faded back to blue. 'Ah,' she whispered. 'Pardon. I didn't mean *that*, monCœur.' She slipped herself back into his arms and ran her fingers through his hair. 'I will never leave. I will, however, be *extremely* angry.'

'I couldn't leave Sirius,' Harry said. 'Pretty much ever since Pettigrew escaped, he's been there for me. And he's never let me down.'

'I am not angry you went,' she murmured. 'I am angry you thought you could get away with leaving me behind. Don't even try to deny it. You went out there, you heard you had to go, then you

*deliberately* sent me a message and apparated off without telling me

where it was you were going!'

'It was going to be dangerous,' Harry whispered. 'I just --- I

couldn't do it\...'

Fleur sighed into his neck. 'It's a good thing we're going to get rid of them all and be free soon, monCœur. I may get quite angry if you keep doing this.'

Harry winced. 'We need to go to Gringotts. I don't know if you can forge an official Gringotts letter or something to lure the Lestranges there, too? That way we can use them to get into the vault and get rid of two of the last inner circle members.' Harry frowned. 'When school starts again, I'll sneak you in through the chamber to the Room of Requirement to help me plan with Nev and Katie.'

*But I've no idea how to get the Lestranges to go to*

*Gringotts.*

'We probably won't need to lure the Lestranges to Gringotts,' Fleur said. 'We just have to wait for them to come and try and sort out their frozen vaults. Now the Ministry is losing, the goblins will probably be inclined to listen and I bet none of the wealthy Death Eaters who've got out of Azkaban will wait too long to get their hands back on their fortunes.' She narrowed her eyes. 'What I don't see is why we need Neville or Katie involved.'

'Katie will cover for me with everyone at Hogwarts.' Harry weighed up his next words and resigned himself to more fury with a sinking heart. 'Nev will have to be the one who comes in with me.'

Fleur's eyes darkened. 'I trust there is a *very* good reason for

that.'

'Polyjuice doesn't work if you're not the same sex,' Harry replied. 'And since Bellatrix is very famously dead\...'

'I can come under the cloak if you and he are polyjuiced.' 'We'll need the cloak to get into the vault.'

She crossed her arms. 'I don't like it.' 'I know, but---'

'*I don't like it.*'

'Have you got a better way to sneak in than Polyjuice?'

Harry asked.

Fleur's brow creased and she drummed her fingers on the table. 'Non. And I don't like that, either.'

'Well, you're really not going to like what else I'm going to have to do,' Harry murmured.

'What?' Fleur's fingers tightened in his clothes, dragging him tight against her until he could feel every curve of her. 'What are you going to do? Another ritual?'

'No more rituals.' Harry kissed her on the tip of her nose. 'I've nothing left to sacrifice for those. I don't need to be more powerful than Voldemort, I just have to kill him. I can't endure what he's endured, anyway. I need my perfect wish.

'We should go to France,\' Fleur said. 'If we're out of time, then I'd like to see Gabby before we get stuck fighting here.'

Harry nodded. 'We've time enough for that.'

She laughed. 'You just want to see the other half of your veela harem.' Fleur sighed. 'I can't believe I've sunk so low as to make those jokes myself.'

The kitchen whirled away into a weak winter sun. The bare branches of the willow tree hung over frost-veiled white pebbles and a cold, clear rippling current.

'It feels a world away,' Fleur murmured.

'I wish we could stay here.' Harry released a long sigh. 'I wish we never had to leave.'

'One day.' She cupped his face in her hands and kissed him

hard. 'Hopefully, the next time you come here, you'll never leave.'

A soft snap echoed over the river and they appeared amidst

Gabby's pile of shoes.

'Fleur! Harry!' Gabby scampered down the stairs and clapped her hands over her mouth. 'Fleur! You promised to warn me before we tried the veela sisters threesome persuasion technique, I'm not wearing my sexy underwear.'

Harry snorted. 'That's okay, Gabby. Neither am I.'

She snickered, darting forward and dragging them both into

a tight hug. 'I missed this feeling,' Gabby breathed. 'It's so beautiful.'

'Is it the feeling of a blossoming veela bond about to happen?' Harry asked.

'Non.' A soft laugh escaped Fleur's lips. 'It's the anticipation of free clafoutis.'

'Nuh uh.' Gabby shook her head. 'It's definitely a veela bond.

However, it won't be permanent until after the veela sisters

threesome, so\...' She pointed upstairs, her eyes glowing with mischief. 'Fleur?'

Fleur's father sighed from down the hall. 'There are some things, as a father, you'd really rather you didn't hear.' He shook his head, half a smile on his face. 'I'm going to pretend that joke never happened.'

'You're lucky Maman didn't hear that joke,' Fleur whispered in Gabby's ear. 'Find your own boyfriend, you little harpy, before I toss you out of the nest and make an omelette of you.'

Gabby giggled. 'Fleur's a bird of prey. She snatches underage boys from their schools and seduces them, then pecks any other girl who gets too close.'

'And I definitely didn't hear that,' Fleur's father remarked,

studying the ceiling.

Heat crept onto Harry's cheeks and Gabby's giggling grew

louder.

'Non.' Fleur pressed a hand over Gabby's mouth. 'No more

chirping from you, little chick. Not unless you *don't* want to come to

Paris with us.'

Gabby tugged Fleur's hand away from her mouth and extricated herself from the hug. 'I'll be good.'

'Sure you will, for about three minutes.' Harry laughed and bent to Fleur's ear. 'We can stay for a little while, if you like? We have to wait for the Polyjuice and the Lestranges at Gringotts or for Dumbledore to find the other one\...'

She flashed him a small, warm smile and watched Gabby tossing pairs of shoes out of her pile by the door. 'I would like that a lot,' Fleur murmured. 'I missed that cheeky harpy.'

# Vision in White

A slim ring of white stone hovered above the palm of Fleur's hand, glowing with soft, pale light. Its gleam flickered in the scatter of glass and ice trinkets resting upon her shelves, or among the stacks of books rising toward the ceiling.

'Fleur?' Gabby stuck her head 'round the door. 'What're you

doing? And where's my veelabondmate?'

Fleur closed her fingers over the ring. '*My* boyfriend has headed back to England for a short while. He needs to do a couple of things in Gringotts and he's gone to visit a friend.'

'A friend you don't like.' Gabby skipped into the room and plopped down cross-legged on the floor opposite Fleur. 'Is it a friend who's a girl?'

'Yes, Katie Bell is a girl.'

'If you'd even the slightest doubt about him, you wouldn't be able to love him.' Gabby shrugged and grabbed her hand, prying her fingers open. 'So it can't be a problem.' She stole the ring from Fleur's hand and held it up, closing her eyes. 'Practising?'

Fleur snatched it back. 'It's hardly the first ring I've made.'

Gabby giggled. 'But it *is* the first ring you've made that feels

like *that*. I can feel your love in this ring, Fleur\...'

'Nosy brat.' Fleur turned it over on her palm. 'I don't want something like all the other rings and that doesn't just mean I want a bigger diamond, or more diamonds, or anything. I want it to be simple and perfect.'

'So you're making it yourself.' Gabby squinted at the ring. 'And you've made it glow, so everyone will notice it. Marking your veela soulmate, Fleur?'

'There are too many girls waiting or hoping for me to vanish.' Fleur slipped a second identical ring from her pocket. 'Once we have these, it will get rid of some of them, I hope.'

'That's not very romantic.' Gabby pouted. 'It's supposed to

be a promise of your undying love.'

'I already have that,' Fleur murmured, a small smile slipping onto her lips. 'He's already mine.' She scooped both rings into her hand and bounced them on her palm. 'I don't need some silly big celebration if we're really going to do this, but it would be nice to hear him promise me again.'

'Are you going to ask him, then?'

'No.' Fleur closed her eyes and pictured the way Harry's fear would fade to rapture. 'I want *him* to ask. I want him to take a leap of faith, to risk me saying no, because then, when I say yes, it will be *perfect*.'

'You told me he would never do that,' Gabby said.

'I'm not quite sure how to get him to ask.' Fleur studied the two rings in her hand. 'Not without goading him into such a panic he thinks he has to do something to stop himself from losing me.'

'Don't do *that*.' Gabby's grey eyes darkened to charcoal. 'That's cruel, Fleur.'

'I know.' She slipped the rings away. 'I'm not going to.'

Gabby's eyes faded back to a smooth, raincloud grey and a gleam of mischief welled up in them. 'Wait\... If you're making rings, does that mean there's a *reason* you're thinking about marriage?' Her gaze dropped to Fleur's stomach. 'Did you have a happy little accident, Fleur?'

A touch of heat blossomed across Fleur's cheeks. 'I'm not pregnant.' Her fingers dropped to her abdomen. 'Not yet,' she whispered.

'Have you decided you want it?'

'I like the idea.' A little girl with silver hair and green eyes danced through the long grass and wildflowers just as a young Gabby had. Fleur's stomach fluttered and her heart flopped about beneath her ribs. 'I like it a lot.' She gave Gabby a broad smirk. 'And the *making* is going to be a lot of fun, too.'

'Can I come?' Gabby chirped.

'No.' Fleur folded her arms. 'You're definitely not invited to

that.'

Gabby giggled. 'I wonder what your magic feels like

during\...' She hopped to her feet. 'Anyway, I actually came to say that Maman and Papa are in the kitchen and would like to talk to you.'

Fleur sighed and drifted after Gabby toward the kitchen. 'If they're going to try and stop me from going back to England, I'm going to lose my temper.'

'I don't think that's it.' Gabby shot Fleur a grin over her shoulder. 'I think it's because Papa overheard my joke yesterday and they're worried what their darling daughters are up to.'

'You're not even up to anything. Or you *better* not be, since

the only boy you talk to belongs to me.'

She laughed and scampered down the stairs. 'You're so possessive, Fleur. Harry's my veela-soul-bond-mate, too!'

Fleur rolled her eyes. 'Stop reading those books!'

Papa and Maman sat on either side of one corner of the kitchen table, cupping steaming mugs of rich-scented coffee.

'Was Fleur hiding, Gabrielle?' Maman asked, setting down her drink. 'That took an awfully long time.'

'Nope,' Gabby chirped. 'She was in the middle of making something.'

'Ah.' Papa smiled. 'Another little piece of art.'

Maman nudged him with her elbow. 'Gabby, you can go.' 'I'm staying,' Gabby said, stealing a sugar cube from the

bowl on the table and dropping it into her mouth.

'That is not a snack bowl,' Papa chided. 'You'll rot your

teeth.'

'If they've not rotted already, they're never going to,' Gabby

replied. 'Besides, veela magic means it can't happen.'

Maman caught Papa's sideways look and shook her head. 'Not a real thing, Laurent. All these years with three veela and you still don't know.'

'It's not my fault,' Papa complained. 'They don't have any useful books on veela, it's all just artwork of scantily clad ladies.' He took a sip of coffee. 'Good artwork, though.'

Maman sniffed. '*Laurent*.'

'I know, ma Chérie.' Papa popped his mug down on the table and grimaced. 'I really would've preferred that you hadn't stayed, Gabrielle. I was hoping I could pretend I still had one innocent, pure daughter.'

'If anything, she's worse than I am,' Fleur jibed.

'Liar.' Gabby giggled. 'You're just upset because we veela- bonded to the same person.'

Papa's brow creased. 'I am\... *mostly* sure that's a joke?'

'It's a joke.' Maman sighed. 'Veela bonds are not a real thing

either.'

'Oh!' Papa's face lightened. 'Well, then there's not really

anything to talk about.'

Maman cleared her throat. 'Except\...'

'Except, of course, to make sure Fleur's being responsible?'

Papa stared down into his coffee mug. 'Which I'm sure she is.'

'Very responsible.' Gabby giggled and poked Fleur in the tummy. 'I'm going to be an aunt soon, I'm going to be an aunt soon.'

'Er\...' Papa's frown deepened. 'You're not actually\... are you?' 'Non.' Fleur swatted Gabby's hand away. 'I'm not.'

'You nearly were!' Gabby chirped, then turned bright red and clapped her hands over her mouth. 'Ooops, pardon, Fleur.'

Little white tufts slipped from Fleur's arms and heat haze shimmered around her clenched fists. 'Get out, Gabrielle.'

Gabby's face crumbled. 'Désolée,' she whispered, slipping

out of her chair and trudging out into the hall.

*Now I have to have a very awkward conversation.* Fleur forced the feathers away. *Merde.*

Maman pursed her lips. 'Unless you *want* to have a baby, you need to be more careful, Fleur.' She drew herself up. 'And you ought to be married first, even if you don't really care too much for the idea; children need a sense of stability. If their parents aren't married and all the other parents the child sees are, they can start to worry.'

Papa put his hand over Maman's. 'Are you thinking about it, ma Petite Fleur? We don't mind if you are, you know. You can tell us these things.' He shared a small smile with Maman. 'We didn't wait very long before we started trying, as you know.'

'But we would rather you were married first,' Maman added. 'It's important for the children.'

Fleur scrambled for some words. 'I'm waiting for Harry to

ask.'

'Do you think he will?' Papa asked. 'I know he will want to,' Fleur said.

Maman tapped her nails on her coffee cup. 'That's not the

same thing.'

'He's a little younger than I am,' Fleur said. 'I'm going to have to wait a little bit, I think.'

'Make sure you're *careful* in the meantime,' Maman said. Papa nodded. 'This isn't the best time, all things considered.'

'Okay.' Fleur swept out of her chair. 'I can't imagine there's anything else to talk about here, not unless you're particularly keen to learn details?'

Papa turned a little green. 'No thank you, ma Petite Fleur.

You can keep that sort of thing to yourself and Gabrielle.'

'Don't go and torment Gabrielle, either,' Maman said. 'I was going to ask you anyway. You do not always approach things in the easiest way for yourself. I was already worrying.'

*I will leave her alone for the rest of the day.* Fleur apparated back up to her room. *That seems fair.*

Gabby jumped off the edge of her bed. 'Sorry, Fleur!' She waved her hands in the air. 'I didn't mean to, I was just being silly.'

'You. Out.' Fleur pointed at the door. 'I'm going to see Harry.' A small smirk played at the edges of her lips. 'And I'm not going to be *careful*.'

Gabby's face fell. 'I'll go. But Fleur, make sure you *tell* him.

You *need* to tell him.'

'I'll tell him.' Fleur closed the door after Gabby, tugged off everything but her socks and underwear, then pulled them off, too, and tossed them into a pile in the corner. She glanced at herself in the mirror, then smiled. 'He's got no reason to regret being mine.'

*But I don't want him to start taking my clothes off straight away.* Fleur plucked a short skirt from her wardrobe and tugged it up her thighs, then slipped on a white bra and blouse. *Well, I do, but Gabby's right, I should say something first.*

She apparated back to their kitchen, stepping onto cool tiles,

feeling a gentle breeze curl 'round her legs and brush between her

thighs. 'Mon Cœur?' Fleur cocked her head, then heard the sound of

laughter from outside. *'Urgh,* she's still here.'

Harry and Katie sat on a conjured bench overlooking the meadows, watching the breeze wash through the long grass. He sketched purple shapes in the air with the tip of his wand, she leant into his side, close enough a little heat began to smoulder in Fleur's blood.

She apparated onto the bench beside them, feeling cool wood against her skin. Fleur tugged her skirt down, checking Katie's line of sight. 'Mon Cœur. Katie.'

Katie flinched away from Harry like she'd been burnt. 'Hi Fleur.' She dragged a weak smile onto her lips. 'Harry was just explaining some charms to me.'

'I saw.' Fleur stole Harry's hand from his lap and interlaced their fingers. 'But I'm afraid we need to have a little talk.'

Harry tensed.

Katie bit at her lip. 'Okay.' She glanced between the two of them. 'Er\... Harry'll have to drop me back at Hogsmeade\...'

'I'll wait here,' Fleur said, releasing Harry's hand.

Harry nodded and took Katie's hand, vanishing with a soft

snap.

Fleur leant back on the bench, tossing her silver hair over

her shoulder, adjusting her bra and closing her eyes. *Be patient.* The thought of his fingers on her and the feel of him in her swirled through her thoughts. A little twist of heat tightened between her thighs and her heart began to beat a little faster. *Remember what Gabby said.*

Harry reappeared with a soft snap. 'Fleur, I---'

'Not that sort of talk,' she murmured, pulling him down onto the bench. 'I got ambushed by my parents, thanks to Gabby's jokes.' Fleur gave her head a little shake to clear her thoughts. 'They wanted to know if we're being *careful*.'

'We are?' Harry swallowed. 'I think?'

'Well\...' Fleur lowered her voice to a whisper and pressed her lips to his neck. 'Not that *one* time outside against the door.'

Harry shifted his legs a little. 'Right. Apart from that time.'

Fleur hid a small smirk and took his fingers, drawing circles

on her knee with his thumb. 'I quite enjoyed that time.'

'I could probably live with doing it again,' Harry said. 'It's not

*that* risky, right?'

Fleur's breath caught and little girls with green irises danced before her mind's eye. 'It's not *that* risky,' she whispered, sliding his hand beneath her skirt and up until his fingertips brushed against the heat between her thighs. 'And I definitely think we should do it again.'

Harry slipped from the bench to kneel between her legs, trailing kisses up the inside of her thighs and pushing her skirt up around her waist. 'You *planned* to do it again,' he murmured.

His cool breath washed over her, sending little tingles through her stomach.

'I might have.' Fleur slid her fingers into his hair and eased her hips forward a little. 'Mon Cœur,' she whispered. 'Don't tease.'

'Don't tease?' The tip of Harry's tongue traced over her, light

as a feather.

Fleur gasped and bucked, clenching her fingers in his hair as her stomach fluttered and the twist of heat curled tight between her thighs. 'Maybe a little bit,' she murmured, biting her lip as fingers slipped into her. 'But---'

Harry's fingers curled and a jolt of pleasure rippled through her. 'But?' A mischievous gleam hovered in his green eyes as he glanced up at her and stuck out his tongue.

Fleur dragged his face up to hers and crushed her lips into his, ignoring the taste of herself on his tongue. 'But I don't really want to be teased...' She slid a hand down to tug open his trousers and pushed him back onto the bench. 'I want to feel you.'

He lifted her thighs as she rose onto her knees, pulling her over his lap and easing her down onto him until her legs shook and little jolts of pleasure fluttered through her. Fleur wrapped her arms around his head and kissed him hard to stifle a moan, rolling her hips until she felt his breath catch and him twitch inside her. Harry's arms curled 'round her, cradling her against him, rocking his hips in time.

'Just a little more,' Fleur gasped, closing her eyes and

burying her face in his shoulder.

He raised his hips a little higher, moving deeper, and the hot twist in her stomach clenched tight, then exploded. Fleur bit his collarbone as white sparks burst before her eyes and the world spun. Harry spent himself inside her in a rush of heat and a soft groan.

'Did it all go to plan?' He drew back and gave her a broad grin. 'Feathered temptress.'

She clung to him, letting the cool breeze wash over her and listening to it rustle in the grass. 'It was perfect.'

'As always?'

Fleur tilted her to one side and shot him a smirk. 'Well,

maybe not always, you made me wait a *really* long time at the start.'

'I'm sorry about that,' Harry said. 'Gabby hadn't yet explained to me that veelabondmates need constant sex or they go mad and start devouring sugar like crazy.'

A soft laugh slipped from her lips and she nestled her head back into the crook of his neck. 'I can still feel you in me.' Fleur released a quiet sigh. 'It's nice.'

'Risky?' Harry twitched and slipped out of her. 'How risky actually is it?'

'A bit late to worry about that,' she murmured as she felt everything trickle back out of her. Fleur yawned and breathed in Harry's scent. 'It's not *that* risky, though. And would it be such a bad thing?'

He ran his fingers through her hair, lulling her eyes closed, then with a soft snap, they tumbled down onto their bed and he drew her close against his chest. 'No, I don't suppose it would.'

# Azkaban's Aftermath

Storm clouds swirled across the ceiling of the Great Hall, flickering with lightning. The dull rumble of thunder swelled over the clatter of cutlery and the hissed whispers of hushed conversations.

Quiet, red-eyed students scattered the four tables and ragged gaps hung heavy amidst the Seventh Years.

*Those mourning, those who've died fighting and those who've fled.*

Ron shovelled eggs onto his plate, and onto the plates of those around him. 'Eat.' He nudged at Dean and Seamus. 'Not eating doesn't help with anything.'

'Malfoy looks like he hasn\'t eaten all holiday,' Nev muttered.

Harry cast a glance across the room. *He's probably running out of time before Voldemort's patience ends.*

Malfoy stared at his plate as Pansy added mushrooms to his breakfast, patting him on the arm and chatting away.

'He\'s as skinny as I used to be,' he said.

'Not a very cheerful start to term,' Neville replied. 'Things are looking bad.'

Harry gave Katie a gentle poke in the arm. She dropped her fork, reaching out and squeezing his fingers, poking her toast around on her plate with the tip of her knife.

*Her father's still with what's left of the Ministry forces in*

*London.* Harry glanced at the front page of the Daily Prophet and the

collage of Dark Marks hanging over small villages. *In a few weeks, Voldemort will have crushed everywhere but here and London.*

'I'm planning on going to Gringotts soon,' he murmured to Nev. 'I went in over the holidays and had a flick through their bookings list. The Lestranges are going in to talk to the goblins about unfreezing their assets in a few days.'

Nev's face paled. 'What are we going to be doing?' Harry lowered his voice to a whisper. 'We're going to

Polyjuice as them, split them up, then you'll accompany one and I\'ll

accompany the other.'

*I'll get rid of one where you can't see, Nev, then use the other to let us into the vault.* He weighed things up. *It'll be risky, but we're out of time.*

'What about the *goblins?'* Nev hissed. 'And what do we *do*

with the Lestranges?'

'I've got a plan,' Harry said. 'Do you trust me?'

Nev held his gaze and sucked in a deep breath. 'I do, but\... why're you asking *me?*'

'Polyjuice requires that both of us be male.' Harry poked Katie. 'Room of Requirement in a minute? Only if you *want* to come.'

Katie shoved her plate away and sipped orange juice from

her goblet. 'I'll be there.'

'I\'ll bring Fleur,' Harry whispered.

'Here?' Katie\'s head swivelled. 'What about the wards?' He smirked. 'I have my ways.'

\'Nobody really believes anything about the two of you outside of our little crowd, you know,' Katie whispered. 'They think she's just another stupid rumour. I keep getting asked if I feel safe dating you...'

*I guess they've more than enough to talk about now.* A small smile spread across his face. *Fleur's going to really hate that, but at least it means she's safe. Voldemort probably doesn't know about her.*

'What do you tell them?' he asked, waggling his eyebrows at her. 'How fantastic I am?'

Katie snorted. 'I tell them that you really know your way around a pair of handcuffs, are great with your fingers and tongue, but that Teen Witch Weekly was right about your impotence.'

He chuckled. 'Thanks. Feel free to tell Romilda, I'm a little concerned about how desperate she's getting. I might get love- potioned\...'

'Are you coming to Defence this afternoon?' Nev asked,

dragging himself out from under the bench.

*I probably should.* Harry drummed his fingers on the table, then stood up and headed for the Room of Requirement. *But no, it's a waste of time. And I've little enough left of that as it is.*

'No,' he said. 'I do wonder who'll be teaching it, though.'

'At this rate it will be Voldemort, because everyone else will be terrified of the curse,' Nev muttered, pausing to wait for Katie at the door. 'Even *Snape* couldn't last.'

'Again,' Harry said. 'It will be Voldemort again.'

'He taught here before?' Katie demanded. 'Who let him?'

'Dumbledore.' Harry grinned. 'Although Voldemort didn\'t apply in the conventional method, spent most of his time sticking out the back of the head of our favourite stuttering idiot.'

'You mean\...' Katie feigned horror and clapped her hands to

her mouth. 'Surely not!?'

Harry laughed, skirting a group of Second Years. 'I\'m afraid

so\...'

'But he seemed so harmless! He was such a cute wizard, all

shy and stuttering, quite chubby, though, and terribly forgetful.'

'Hey!' Nev cried. 'There\'s nothing sticking out the back of my head, thank you.'

Katie batted at the tufts sticking up from the crown of

Harry's head. 'More than can be said for you, Harry.'

'Shush you.' Harry slipped a hand down the inside of shirt and pulled out the acorn. 'Azure,' he murmured, watching it spread out into a mirror.

'That's amazing,' Katie breathed. 'Is that a magic mirror?

Where did you *get* that?'

'Fleur made it,' Harry said. 'You two go on ahead, I'll be with you in a moment.'

Fleur's blue eyes and small smile shimmered into view.

'Ready, monCœur?'

'Ready.'

He gave her a slow, deliberate blink. *I love you.*

She returned his blink and her smile softened. 'If I bounce off the wards, you're going to have to buy me a *mountain* of cake, monCœur.'

'I've invited you, it'll be fine.' Harry grinned. 'And I'll end up buying you cake anyway. Make sure you use the cloak, it's on the desk in the study. So's the map of the castle, but you can probably remember the way?'

'I can.' Fleur wavered, reappearing cast in shadows. 'This cloak smells. Do you ever wash it?'

'No. It never occurred to me.'

'I am going to have to wash my hair,' Fleur groused, hurrying through Myrtle's bathroom.

'I don\'t think it\'s been washed in centuries,' Harry whispered,

setting off toward the Room of Requirement.

'Harry.' Ron stepped out of one of the secret passages. 'Headed upstairs?'

'Yeah.' He studied Ron's expression. 'You've misplaced your girlfriend?'

'We split up.' He shrugged. 'Hermione's all wound up over Malfoy and whatever you're up to. Doesn't have time for anything like that.' A brief shadow passed across his face. 'I think she was afraid I'd try and cage her up at home like Mum chose one day, too. I'd never, but, you know Hermione, once she's got something in her head\...'

'Sorry to hear about it,' Harry said. 'It's not much fun, splitting up.'

Ron nodded. 'Yeah. It really isn't. Still, we made a decent job of it, still friends when she's not off tailing Malfoy or worrying about you.'

'She's got no reason to worry about either of us,' Harry said, feeling a pair of arms snake around his neck and catching a whiff of marzipan. 'Malfoy's clearly not having any luck and about the only nefarious thing I've done recently involved a bench, a nice view, and something that may well be considered public indecency.'

Ron's ears turned red. 'Right. Well, I've got to get to my Care lesson. Later.'

'It wasn't public,' Fleur whispered in his ear. 'And your view

was definitely better than *nice,* monCœur.'

Harry smothered a flash of Fleur's flushed face, trembling nude legs and the skirt bunched about her waist. *Not helpful thoughts*.He opened the small wooden door opposite Hogwarts\'s worst tapestry and led Fleur inside.

Nev and Katie sat around a small fire on battered chintz

sofas. 'Harry?'

'And Fleur.' He tugged the cloak off her, mussing her cascade of silver hair. 'See?' Harry stepped out of range and took a seat in the middle of the sofa beside Katie.

'Why am I here?' Katie demanded, swinging her feet around

and dropping them close to Harry\'s lap.

Harry eyed her toes as Fleur settled herself down beside him. 'Well, someone has to be around to cover for us while we\'re gone.'

'Have you come up with a *plan,* monCœur?' Her eyes dropped to Katie's red-varnished toe-nails and flicked up to her face. 'A *real* plan?'

'We turn up just before the Lestranges meet the goblins at the bank, acquire some hairs, split the pair up and go from there.' Harry pointed at Nev. 'You can go as Rabastan, as he doesn't say much, by all accounts. Rodolphus is the eldest and the leader, so it's more of a risk. I'll be him. One of us will go to the vault. The other will delay and then go down. Once we're in the vault and out of sight, I'll deal with the Lestranges.' He grinned. 'Then we can just walk out.'

'You will have to cross the protections that Gringotts employs.' Fleur tugged at her little finger. 'Most of these won\'t trouble you, since you\'re being taken to the vault by one of their tellers, but the Polyjuice will only last until you cross the waterfall.'

'The waterfall?'

'It undoes the effects of most magic,' Fleur said. 'It\'s one of the goblins\' finest pieces of enchanting. The water is enchanted and cycles 'round.'

'Does nobody ever complain about getting wet?' Harry

asked.

'It only needs to be near you,' Fleur said. 'It passes either

side of the path, but the touch of the spray is enough.'

'It\'s not much of a plan,' Nev murmured. 'If the Polyjuice can't get through the waterfall, then even a second dose will still not get us out, because we'll go back through the waterfall.'

'Harry\'s plans never are, he likes to improvise.' Fleur's eyes darkened several hues. 'And you can't take a second dose of Polyjuice, it'd be too soon after the first dose.'

*Uh oh*.

'How good are you at duelling, Nev?' Harry exchanged a long look with Fleur. 'Decent?'

'I\'m not sure,' Nev said. 'Nowhere near as good as you, probably, but I'm one of the best in the DA. You should come and help us, really. Things are getting pretty bad\...'

'I can do that.' He leant back on the sofa, ignoring Katie's feet squirming under his leg. 'If Voldemort attacks here, you'll need to be able to fight.'

*Even if it's just long enough to let me go after Voldemort's*

*snake or Voldemort himself.*

'Good.' Nev let out a sigh. 'The next meeting is in a few days\' time, I'll drag you there if I have to.'

'Excellent.' Harry watched the little fire dance. 'That's probably about as much planning as there's any point in doing. Once we're in, we're in, we can worry about the rest as we go.'

Katie hunched her knees into her chest and wrapped her arms around her legs. Fleur lifted herself over Harry's lap and pushed him to the far end of the sofa, murmuring in Katie's ear.

Nev shuffled his feet, glancing between the two girls and

Harry. 'I'd best be off. I need to do a few things in the Greenhouses.'

'Bye, Nev.' Harry watched the door swing shut. 'You okay,

Katie?'

'No,' she snapped. 'This is stupid. And dangerous. And

you're probably not going to come back to me!'

'He\'ll be fine,' Fleur murmured. 'If he doesn\'t come back in one piece I promise to let you hex him, but only after *I\'m* done with him.'

'I suppose you should go first.' Katie sighed and buried her face into her knees. 'All things considered.'

'It's okay.' Fleur patted her on the shoulder. 'It always feels like this, I understand.'

'Do you?' Katie\'s tone turned bitter. 'How could you? Even if he comes back, he's not really coming back to *me.* And of course he isn't. It's not even unfair. You're everything anyone could ever hope to be, it makes perfect sense.'

Harry winced from a sharp stab of guilt and wished the Room of Requirement would open up and swallow him whole.

The fire vanished.

He sighed. *Wishes never come true.*

Fleur caught Harry's eye. 'Not too long ago, beside the Black Lake, I watched Harry turn away from me. I was sure he hated me, so there was nothing I could do but watch him walk away, watch you follow him, watch you catch him. I was certain I'd lost.'

'I should've walked faster,' Katie muttered. 'But even then, you'd've only stolen him in the end anyway.'

'It\'s probably best not to think about it.' Fleur rose from the middle of the sofa and plucked the cloak off the arm. 'Things are what they are. It's too late to change them now.'

Katie flinched. 'Sorry.' She threw a furtive glance at Harry, caught his eye and flushed bright red. \'That must have been awkward for you\...'

'Little bit, but I\'m glad I heard it. You'll always be my friend,

Katie.'

*Thank you.* He shared a soft look with Fleur.

'I should go.' Katie leapt from the sofa and hurried out.

The door slammed shut.

'Thank you,' Harry said.

'I told you,' Fleur murmured, sliding into his lap. 'She loves

you, but she wants you to be happy. She knows you're happy with me.' She rested her head in the crook of his neck. 'The moment I make a mistake, she'll try and steal you, but if I don't, she'll do nothing more than try and put her feet in your lap.'

'I'm still glad you were nice.' He pressed a kiss to the tip of her nose. 'She's my best friend, even if it's kind of complicated.'

'She's not wrong, either.' Fleur sighed. 'I did steal you, in a way. It was me throwing my allure at you that caused your fight, then after I tore you apart, what did I do if not sweep in and take you for myself?'

'Katie\'s a nice girl. Cute, too.' He smiled at the pout that crept across her lips. 'I can go back, if you prefer?'

'Non.' She dragged his lips down to hers. 'You are *mine,*

mon Cœur. I feel bad for Katie, but it was her dream or *ours.*' 'She's not perfect,' Harry whispered.

'Nobody else is perfect for you like I am.' Her lips traced the line of his jaw. 'I am Fleur Delacour.'

Harry chuckled. 'Doesn\'t say it on the Triwizard Trophy though, does it?'

'You cheated.'

'Only by accident and that was the only round you actually beat me in.' Harry cradled her into his chest and sighed. 'Have you found anything else about the Resurrection Stone?'

'Non. Pardon.'

'Damn.'

'We'll find it,' Fleur murmured. 'There's no time now, but after we're free, we can try scrying for it or something like that.'

'Anything is worth a try.' He folded his cloak up. 'You can just leave this in the study.'

'Non.' Fleur wrinkled her nose. 'That's not happening.'

'No?\' Harry frowned. 'If you don't wear it, you'll show up on

the castle wards straight away.'

'I meant I'm not going to fold it up and put it back in the study,' she said. 'I\'m taking it back to the Meadow and then I\'m washing it... *Repeatedly*.'

# The Gloves are Off

Harry sat in the quiet, far corner of the Room of Requirement and watched the crowd of students chatter.

*Nev's got about half the remaining school here. He teaches more students than most of the teachers.* He glanced down at the short note Katie had handed him after lunch and stuffed it into his pocket. *If this takes much longer, I'll be late to meet with Dumbledore.*

'Where\'s Nev?' Ron wondered, ushering Hermione over to join him. 'He\'s not normally late.'

The door creaked open.

'Sorry,' Nev apologised. 'I\'ve been searching for my

assistant, but he\'s proven elusive.'

*That's because I beat you here. You did say it\'d be best to*

*meet here.*

'Your assistant?' Ron frowned. 'Who? Cedric's left.'

'Last time you had an assistant it was Harry\...' Hermione chewed her lip. 'I'm not so sure that's a good idea if we're going to be duelling.'

'He\'s still my assistant and we need to learn how to duel properly.'

'Why can\'t *you* teach us that?' Zacharias Smith called. 'I don\'t really know what I\'m doing, beyond the spells

themselves,' Nev admitted. 'Harry does.'

'What about Hermione?' Terry Boot suggested. 'I heard she produced non-verbal spells first time in all her classes and they\'re meant to be important for duelling.'

'I can teach,' Hermione said, bouncing on the balls of her feet. 'I'd be happy to.'

'And you're better than Harry?' Nev levelled a long look at her. 'He said he'd come. He's probably just running late.'

'Well\...' Hermione gestured around. 'He's not here.' 'Aren\'t I?\' Harry dispelled his Disillusionment Charm and

stood up.

'I can still teach this.' Hermione folded her arms. 'I've been

doing a *lot* of research.'

'If you don\'t want my help, then I won\'t give it.'

'No, Harry.' Nev shook his head. 'I run the DA, not Hermione.

You don\'t have to go. They just don\'t realise the difference yet, but

we can show them\...'

'That\'s probably not a good idea,' Harry said.

'Afraid you\'d lose?!' Smith wriggled to the front of the crowd and sneered. 'Neville\'s probably better than you from what I\'ve seen, you\'re just worried we\'ll tell everyone you aren\'t all that great after all.'

'You\'ve been telling people that for years, Smith,' Harry replied, smothering a trickle of ice in his veins. 'In second year, you thought I was setting a giant snake on muggle-borns, in third year people stopped listening to you briefly because they realised you\'re an idiot, but, oddly, they forgot again afterwards, and since then

you\'ve been telling everyone I\'m a dark wizard, or some other

nonsense.'

'You *are* a dark wizard,' Smith snapped.

He swallowed the pinprick of cold in his chest. 'Not contradicting me calling you an idiot, then.'

'How about a test.' Hermione worried at her lip, studying Harry with sharp brown eyes. 'One potential teacher against the others. Whichever side wins the duel clearly knows more, and should teach. That\'s fair.'

'Others?' Nev asked.

'It\'s Harry or it\'s us,' Hermione said. 'His way or our way.' 'You want to duel Harry... *voluntarily*.' Nev's eyebrows crept

up. 'That doesn't seem smart.'

'Normal duelling rules,' Hermione said. 'No dangerous spells, no leaving the ring, and no talking about anything except the duel until the duel is over.'

'And when *is* the duel over?' Harry slipped his wand out of his sleeve. 'I'm starting to think it would be a good idea to demonstrate how it feels fighting a skilled duellist after all.'

'If one side is stunned or unable to use magic,' Hermione

recited.

Harry.'

Nev sighed and pulled out his wand. 'Not the face, please,

He grinned. 'I won\'t damage anything Hannah will miss.' Nev turned bright red. 'We\'ll need a ring.'

Harry tossed a ribbon of purple flame out into a circle

around them. 'Done.'

Hermione drew her wand from her waist, tapping its tip against her palm as she moved to stand next to Neville on the opposite side of the ring from him.

'Five sickles say they beat Potter inside a minute,' Smith

shouted.

'Two minutes,' Ernie Macmillan called.

*I'm going to enjoy this.* Harry allowed himself a small, thin

smile. *You wanted me to be different. Well, time to see the difference between all of you and me.*

'Will you adjudicate, Ron?' Hermione asked. Ron screwed his face up. 'Will I what?'

'Judge, Ron.' Hermione sighed. 'You need to judge.' 'Oh. Why didn\'t you just say so?'

Hermione bit her lip, bouncing on the balls of her feet. Nev stared at his wand. Behind him, the walls began to sprout thick padding.

Ron yawned. 'Begin!'

'Stupefy,' Hermione hissed, drawing her wand through the

full motion and from it into a handful of school-corridor hexes.

Harry batted them away, deflecting each curse into the ground to leave small, smoking rings.

'Neville,' Hermione urged, casting stunners as she circled around to Harry's right.

'Right.' Nev mirrored her on Harry's left.

*I wonder.* Harry threw up his shield, watching faint, red ripples splash across the wall of glowing silver light like raindrops on glass. *This is a bubble in the wards, or it should be capable of becoming one, so I should be able to apparate within the room.*

A bright, red beam shot from the tip of Hermione\'s wand

and another came from Nev's.

Harry swirled the world back past him and appeared on the far side of the circle with a soft snap. The two red spells fizzled out against the walls.

'That\'s *impossible*,' Hermione muttered. 'The wards at Hogwarts can\'t be breached.'

'He\'s using the room,' Nev said.

'Good guess.' Harry raised his wand. 'But now it\'s my turn.'

He unleashed a crackling, sparkling hail of colours.

Spells hissed and spattered off the floor and walls around Nev, bursting in washes of colour on his shield. Hermione conjured a piece of wood before the two of them and hunched in behind it, holding their shield charms.

Harry flicked his wand in an almost imperceptible vee and sent a blasting curse through the wood, ripping it into splinters. He poured magic into the Jelly-Legs Jinx, punching through Nev\'s shield like it was wet paper. Every subsequent spell tore through the fading bubble of light, leaving Nev with boneless, waving legs, a faceful of tentacles, waist-length, teal hair, and no wand.

A groan of disappointment rose from the audience.

*Of course they want me to lose.* He let the pinprick of cold in his chest swell into a clenched, freezing fist. *Well, you can't tear me down now. I don't need to be a hero. I know who I am.* He let Fleur's face hover before his mind\'s eye. *I know what I want.*

'Flammamungui,' Hermione cried.

A thin, hooked claw of fire lunged from the tip of her wand,

singing Harry's shoulder as he threw himself out of the way.

*Nothing dangerous, huh.* Harry threw a long look at Ron, who looked down at his shoes. *And even the judge is against me. Well, I\'ll show you what happens to girls who play with fire, Hermione.*

He flicked his wand and the splinters on the floor twisted into shining shards of glass, rising into a flurry of moths. They swirled about her in a vicious storm, beating against her raised shield until their wings broke and they fell to the floor.

Harry let his magic rush through him to his wand, enjoying the jolt of warmth rippling back from it up his arm. Hermione emerged wearing a huge smile, sweeping the remnants of his moths off the floor and sending the razor sharp shards back at his face.

Harry let furious white sparks burst from his wand. *This will hurt a little, but if I let go of this spell, someone will get killed.* Harry forced the white sparks bursting from his wand into a swirling spiral too bright to look upon, filling the room with the scent of ozone.

The glass sliced hot, thin lines through his robes and across

his face.

*Ow.*

Hermione froze.

'Hermione!' Nev shouted. 'What happened to nothing dangerous!'

Ron grimaced and took a step forward. 'Hermione's dis---\' 'It's fine.' Harry caught a drop of blood from his cheek on the

ball of his thumb, licking it off and watching the cuts fade to pink

lines. 'You're going to get a lot worse than scratches in any duel you fight.' He levelled his wand at Hermione's chest, forcing the swirling magic toward the tip. 'Fulminis.'

Harry dipped the tip of his wand just as his magic sprang forth. A single flash of lightning pierced through Hermione's shield, scattering its light like sparks in the draft of a fire, and melting a two- metre hole in the floor beneath her toes.

Hermione\'s eyes narrowed and thick bands of copper twisted out of the air.

*Clever.* Harry forced his magic into her conjurations, scouring her intent from them and sent them snaking \'round the edges of the circle, forcing her back toward the edge, burying her beneath a storm of spells.

She threw up her shield, grimacing as the copper snakes hammered at it and Harry's spells burst against it in explosions of bright light.

'And we're done.' Harry sent a vibrant, crimson bolt of magic

through Hermione\'s shield into her sternum.

She dropped like a stone.

Rennervate,' Ron muttered, jabbing his wand at her.

Hermione remained still. Harry released Nev, then revived Hermione himself.

'Well.' Nev patted his chin to check all of the tentacles were gone. 'I think the winner is pretty obvious.\' He turned to Hermione and fixed her with a long glare. 'You shouldn\'t have broken the rules, someone could've got hurt.'

Hermione huffed and turned away. 'Harry wasn't even

fazed.'

'Care to explain what you did, Harry?' Nev asked.

'I played to my strengths and avoided yours.' Harry pointed

his wand at Nev. 'You're more powerful than Hermione, but you throw spells on instinct. Hermione's cleverer, but not as strong. If you'd worked together, you might've been hard to beat, so I avoided letting you do that.'

'And your strengths?' Smith demanded.

Harry levelled a flat stare at him. '*Dark magic*.'

Nev snorted. 'You deserve that, Smith, you complete twat.' He tucked his wand away. 'Remember that our goal is to survive, not to kill them. We just have to be good enough to get away.'

*Still naive, Nev*. *Running away only lets you fight again. You have to beat them at some point.* He smothered a flash of cold anger. *Or you can wait for someone else to do it for you, I suppose.*

Harry checked the time. 'I need to leave.' 'Meeting Dumbledore?' Nev asked.

'Yeah,' Harry replied. 'I might check on Katie, too. I was expecting her to come this evening.'

*I hope she's not avoiding me again.*

'We\'re in Hogwarts,' Nev said. 'There\'s not much that could happen to her.'

Harry gave him a long, flat stare, then began to count on his

fingers. 'Cerberus. Voldemort. Basilisk. Voldemort. Werewolf. Dementors. Death Eater. Another Death Eater. More Voldemort. Death Trap tournament\... And I'm out of fingers.'

'There\'s not much that could happen to her as long as she isn\'t near you,' Nev amended with a grin.

*Too right, Nev.* Harry ignored a stab of guilt. *But I let her choose*. *She chose to stand by me.*

'I think she hadn\'t finished her Transfiguration essay,' Hermione said. 'She was in the library, sulking.'

'Good.' A swoop of relief swept through Harry's stomach. 'She'll be gutted she missed me playing around with you two.'

'Playing?' Hermione drew herself up. 'Duelling isn't meant to be fun.'

'But winning is,' Harry replied. 'And winning's all that's left when everyone wants to see you lose.'

Hermione flinched.

*She was pretty quick to throw some half-dangerous spells at me.* Harry slipped out of the room before anyone else could delay him and hurried toward the Headmaster's Office. *Ones she'd no idea if I could counter.*

'Sherbet Lemon.' Harry stubbed his toe on the gargoyle and cursed under his breath until the little flare of pain faded. 'Sugar

crystal, fizzing whizz-bee, cockroach cluster, chocolate frog, jelly slug, sugar quill, liquorice wand, acid pop---\'

The gargoyle sprang aside.

*That's absurdly easy to guess.* He shrugged. *A shame I*

*didn't know that before, I guess.*

'Harry.' Dumbledore peered down at him from the top of the steps. 'I wondered who had managed to open the gargoyle when I had only just changed the password.'

'You asked me to meet you, professor,' Harry said. 'Indeed I did. I was about to send Fawkes to find you, but

you seem to have figured out this particular piece of confectionary

yourself.' Dumbledore pottered back into his office as Harry climbed the stairs and offered him a chair. 'How are you feeling about your NEWTs, Harry? Confident? Even Professor Slughorn hasn't seen you since we came back from the Christmas Break.'

*Confident enough.*

'A lot's been going on, sir. I'll be okay, though.' Harry glanced at the pensieve. 'Are we going to look at some more memories? Have you made any progress looking for the horcruxes?'

'In but a moment, Harry.' Dumbledore smiled and the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes crinkled. 'First things first, however. I can invite Professor Tofty in for three days' time, Harry, if that suits you? I fear delaying would be unwise, given current circumstances, though Professor Tofty has been more than keen to move here behind the safety of the wards.' He steepled his fingers. 'I've also taken the liberty of adding an apparition test.'

'Thank you, professor.'

Dumbledore sighed. 'I can sense your impatience, Harry. Very well. Time for another insight into the mind of Tom Riddle.' He folded his gloved hands into his lap. 'When he was very young, Tom discovered that he was different from other children. I suspect, from how his accidental magic manifested and grew into something more sinister, that he was not well-treated where he grew up.'

*Of course he wasn't. Shallow little people hate those they fear are better than them.*

'Where did he grow up?' Harry asked.

'Tom\'s mother was a woman named Merope Gaunt. She died shortly after giving birth to him, leaving him in the care of a muggle orphanage.'

*The Gaunts. Not a great family, from what Gringotts's*

*records showed.*

'The Gaunts claim to be descended from Salazar Slytherin and their ability to speak Parseltongue made it difficult to deny. They were blood purists of the most unfortunate kind, marrying within their own family tree, sometimes even brother to sister, to preserve their purity.' Dumbledore pulled his spectacles off, rubbed the bridge of his nose, and replaced them. 'Merope fell in love with a rich muggle, seducing him with what I suspect to be love potions, given she was a squib, the nature of their affair, and how it came to an unfortunate end after she became pregnant.'

'I imagine Tom Riddle Senior didn\'t take that well.'

'No. Merope was abandoned by him and died a few weeks after naming her son, quite possibly in part from the depression that sometimes affects women after they give birth. Her brother, Morfin, and her father, Marvolo, never even searched for her.'

'Heartless.'

*Salazar would've been furious.*

'I daresay Merope was grateful she was not found.' Dumbledore sighed. 'Marvolo wouldn't've taken kindly to what his daughter had done, especially not as she took one of his precious heirlooms, the locket we saw together before, with her. Still, it is sad that she found herself so bereft of affection; life often offers us naught but bitter pills, and there is little we can do but swallow them and pretend they are sweet.' He offered Harry the bowl of Sherbet Lemons, taking one for himself.

'So Voldemort grew up never knowing about his family

either,\' Harry said, helping himself to one of the sour, yellow sweets.

'It is my belief that Tom was never treated with any real affection by anyone when he was young and by the time he realised he was different, he'd come to hate the world that had so far hated him.' Dumbledore sighed and rubbed his eyes. 'When I gave him his Hogwarts letter, he was overjoyed, but so distrustful, as if he was waiting for it all to be snatched away at any moment.'

*Of course he was. That's what always happens.*

'So he came to Hogwarts.' Harry kept his expression unreadable. 'And then what?'

'I saw little of Tom for the first four years he was here,' Dumbledore admitted. 'Events around the world demanded my attention. However, when I met him in his fifth year, he was a boy wearing two faces. Sometimes I would see him at the heart of the crowd, blazing with charisma, but behind that face lurked only selfish ambition and a terrible hunger. He collected trinkets and trophies, hoarding things that held any value to him.' Dumbledore leant back in his chair and tugged open the cabinet behind him. 'That, Harry, is one

thing that has never changed. As his estimation of himself grew, so

did the value of his trinkets, but he never stopped collecting them.' 'He would've used them to make his horcruxes,' Harry said.

*Maybe he didn't see it as defiling them. Maybe he just couldn't bear to put a piece of his soul into anything he didn't consider precious.*

Dumbledore rose from his seat to stir the pensieve with the tip of his wand. 'I am not sure whether he made this ring or the diary first, but I do know that he killed his father and his father\'s family.

Knowing him like I do, I suspect he used the death of his father to make a horcrux of the ring he took from his uncle. It held a neatness Tom would've appreciated. In one go, he secures immortality, avenges his mother and himself on his uncle, and rids himself of any muggle relations.'

*It's efficient.* Harry smothered a faint smile. *It's nice to do*

*things in one clean, elegant sweep.*

'What about the locket and the cup?' he asked. 'Do we know where he got those?'

Dumbledore extended a gloved hand in Harry's direction. 'I will show you the horcrux I found this summer before we speak of the ones still hidden. It's best if you see for yourself just how Tom views people, it will help you understand him and find these horcruxes yourself, should it come to that.'

Harry smothered a snort of laughter. *Should it come to that. You're using me to help find the other horcruxes, then you intend to send your living one off to slaughter with a head full of delusions.*

He dipped into the pensieve and found himself on an overgrown path in the soft, warm rain of summer. Green woods

stretched away on either side of him and soft, brown clay lay beneath the thicket of brambles, bushes and bluebells.

'The Gaunt\'s manor,' Dumbledore said, pointing over the

pin-striped shoulder of his memory self at a dilapidated shack.

'Manor?' Harry raised an eyebrow.

'The Gaunt family are descended from the Peverells and other illustrious families but, once their excessive inbreeding grew too much for even other purist families to stomach, they were isolated. Their fortune dwindled to nothing more than a handful of heirlooms they were too proud to part with and their manor crumbled until this was all that remained of them.'

They followed the memory of the headmaster as he hummed some cheerful dirge, strolling up the path and bending any stray branches out of the way of his plum suit with a flick of his wand.

'As you can see, Harry---\' Dumbledore indicated the rotting, swollen bodies of dead serpents writhing in the mud between the gate and the shack '---Voldemort does not leave his horcruxes unguarded.'

The plum-suited Dumbledore paused at the gate, flourishing his wand and revealing a set of burning purple runes running along the boundary of the property. The headmaster paused, cut his thumb and pressed it upon the gate. The serpent inferi swarmed in a thick, festering wave toward the path, but Dumbledore walked past them as if they were not there.

Harry trailed after him through the sea of serpents. 'The snakes, professor, why did they not attack?'

'Voldemort does not want anyone leaving with his treasure,' Dumbledore said. 'But anyone who comes here has learnt a secret he doesn't want known at all. He desires to lure them in before trapping and killing them.'

'So the blood?'

'A sacrifice to ensure the visitor is weakened when they try to leave.' Dumbledore shook his head. 'An effective way to handicap a confident wizard, but a crude one, and, as always, Tom underestimates what he doesn't value.'

The mouldering bones of a serpent fell from the rotting wood of the door when Dumbledore forced it open with a flick of his wand.

'The wards within were quite clever,' Dumbledore said. 'Strong enough to make you think a serious attempt at defence was being made and to tire anyone who found this place, but weak enough to be overcome and let them further into the trap.' He led Harry after his memory self, drawing Harry\'s attention to the stacks of gold, ancient tomes, and gleaming, enchanted trinkets as his memory stripped the magic away to reveal bricks of clay, twigs, and dead leaves. 'For all his ingenuity, Tom consistently underestimates people. I do not think he believes it possible for a person to exist without ambition, avarice, or anger.'

'What would happen if you touched any of it?' Harry asked. 'A powerful compulsion to take more,' Dumbledore said.

'And no doubt a number of horrible curses, too.'

A rough stone plinth appeared in the centre of the house.

The ring Dumbledore wore gleamed within a small depression, guarded by a shining silver serpent.

'And now for my mistake.' Dumbledore sighed as his memory-self stripped the snake away. 'It doesn't do to dwell on dreams, my boy, not all of them are achievable, and in chasing them, we are wont to throw away our lives.'

Harry watched Dumbledore drop his wand to the floor and

pluck the ring off the plinth with wide eyes. 'I found it!'

His hand withered, turning black, and Dumbledore snatched his wand up to cast half a hundred spells on his forearm. A dark stone glittered upon the gold band, marked with a triangle, a circle, and a single line.

*I\'ve found it!* Bright, hot triumph swirled through Harry's veins as he found himself back in Dumbledore's office. *The Resurrection Stone. Now I just have to take it...* A hot lump welled up in his throat and tears prickled in his eyes. *And then I'll have Salazar back.*

'As you can see, Harry.' Dumbledore peeled his glove back from his withered hand. 'It's most dangerous to go after these alone. I would like, if you are amenable, of course, for you to accompany me to a certain location in a week's time.'

*Perfect.* Harry stared at the mark of the Deathly Hallows upon the black stone and grappled with the heady rush of victory before it showed on his face. *Freedom's so close I can almost taste it.*

'Why me, sir?' he asked.

'Why not someone older? Or more powerful?' Dumbledore gave Harry a gentle smile. 'There're few wizards as powerful as you, Harry, and I can trust none of them. And, unlike them, you've something most don't, an ability that Tom cannot understand or anticipate.\'

'Love?' Harry managed to keep the withering condemnation

from his tone.

'Yes, Harry.' Dumbledore beamed and Fawkes let out a soft trill. 'Tom will always underestimate and dismiss power he cannot comprehend. Were it not for the mutilation of his soul, he would've been utterly destroyed by your mother\'s sacrifice. You see the difference between the two of you, one born from a loveless union, the other with parents who sacrificed their lives for their child.'

*A child you're desperate to make sure follows in his parents'*

*footsteps.*

'I wouldn't know, sir, would I?' He let a bright smile spread across his face. 'My relatives never really showed me much affection.'

Dumbledore bowed his head. 'Alas, family is not always easy. But you\'re a lot like your mother, Harry. You may resemble your father, but inside you burns a fire as bright as your mother's love.

That passion, that devotion to the one she loved most, drove your mother to perform magic capable of overcoming anything Tom could ever hope to cast. Sometimes a great deed must come at great personal cost.'

Harry pointed at his withered hand. 'So it would seem, sir.' 'This is merely the most recent such lesson for me.'

Dumbledore smiled and steepled his fingers. 'Death is not so terrible,

Harry. Many of those I hold dear are waiting for me. I think it's far worse a fate to live on alone as Tom intends.'

*Emptiness or emptiness. Damned either way.*

Harry's eyes flicked back to the Resurrection Stone. 'A pity those we hold dear can't be brought back to us,' he murmured.

Dumbledore straightened his spectacles and peered at Harry with sharp blue eyes. 'It is selfish of the living to drag the dead from their rest and dangerous to dabble between worlds that ought to remain separate. Your parents have long been gone from us, their time has passed, just as the time of so many of my friends has.'

*The last enemy to be destroyed is death.*

'It's not possible anyway, I suppose,' Harry said. 'You're a better wizard than I was when I was younger,

Harry,\' Dumbledore whispered. 'I couldn't resist the lure.' He

straightened up and pushed the cabinet shut. 'I think that's enough until next week, Harry.'

'Do you think it's likely to be there?' Harry asked. 'Which one

is it?'

'I am confident,' Dumbledore said. 'It is a place Tom was

once fond of, an escape from his childhood home at the orphanage. I suspect we will find the locket bearing Slytherin's emblem there, since Tom associates his childhood and his ancestry most closely.'

Harry nodded. 'Goodnight, then, professor.'

*All my goals within my reach.* He let triumph surge through his veins, a wide smile spreading across his lips. His desire welled up, hot and bright as Fiendfyre. *I just have to reach out and take them.*

# Perfect Wishes

'Shouldn\'t you be somewhere?' Katie dropped herself into the sofa beside him, swinging her feet into his lap and flopping back onto the arm.

'I probably should be.' He checked the clock. 'I've another

couple of minutes, though.'

'Last set of exams at Hogwarts!' She waved her hands in

the air and beamed.

'I'll've completed my NEWTs before you.' Harry stuck his tongue out at her. 'Done the written ones and the Potions practical, now it's just the easy bits left.'

'When did you do the Potions practical?' Katie demanded. 'Yesterday...' Harry tapped one of her emerald-varnished

toes with a finger. 'Why have you defected to Slytherin?'

'It's a nice colour.' She wiggled her toes in his lap. 'And it's not the same green as Slytherin, either.' Katie swept her fringe away from her eyes. 'How'd the Potions practical go?'

'Well enough,' he said. 'It's not going to be an O, but an E or A will do for me. Of course, Fleur got straight Os, so I\'ll never hear the end of it, but she didn't have to take hers in the middle of a civil war.' Harry raised his finger. '*And*, more importantly, *I* won the Triwizard Tournament.'

'And you have an apparition licence now.' Katie bounced her heels on his thigh and beamed. 'Which means you're finally allowed to apparate around everywhere like you usually do.'

'Takes all the fun out of it, really.' He threw a glance at the clock. 'Time for me to do the last few.'

The smile faded from Katie's face. 'Are you leaving afterward?'

'Not straight away,' Harry said. 'There's things I've still got

to do...'

*Two counts of horcrux hunting. One count of snake slaying.*

*And then I can steal the Resurrection Stone from Dumbledore and escape.* He breathed out a long sigh. *Only Voldemort will be left.*

'Good.' Katie's grin reappeared. 'We\'ll leave together at the end of the year.'

'What're you going to do when you leave?' Harry frowned. 'I don't remember you ever saying.'

'Because I\'m not sure.' She shrugged. 'I've a few try-outs with quidditch teams, but nobody huge, and my exam results are good enough to apply to most other places, so if quidditch doesn\'t work out, I guess I\'ll just search for something bearable.'

Harry picked her feet up and placed them back on the sofa, pulling himself to his feet. 'It'll go fine. You've got the best broom a girl could borrow and then refuse to give back.'

Katie jumped up and threw her arms \'round him, squeezing tight. 'Good luck. Try not to set a giant raven on everyone nearby this time.'

'I\'ll try my hardest.' He chuckled and slipped out of her hug. 'Hogsmeade afterward? In about half an hour? I'll buy you chocolates, maybe even firewhiskey...'

Katie beamed, thrusting her fists in the air. 'Yes! Angelina and Alicia are here, too, so we can catch up at the pub.'

'See you in Hogsmeade, then.' Harry set off toward his final

set of exams.

Empty, quiet corridors stretched from the staircase to McGonagall's office. He pushed the door open with a creak and stepped in. Dumbledore, McGonagall, Professor Tofty and a sheepish Professor Slughorn waited within.

'Harry.' Dumbledore clapped his bright gloves together. 'I\'m afraid you will have a bit of an audience. Professor McGonagall decided to stay, and since this is her room I couldn\'t find it in me to refuse. Professor Slughorn assures me that he left his class of fifth years under supervision to come and watch, though I didn\'t realise you were taking a Potions exam.\'

\'I\'m not,\' Harry said, stepping into the centre of the room.

'That was yesterday.'

Slughorn chortled. 'I wanted to see how well Harry does. I remember his parents being very gifted.'

The door creaked.

'Oh,' Flitwick squeaked. 'I didn\'t realise so many of us were coming, don\'t you have a class, Horace?'

'I left it in the capable hands of a pair of my seventh years,' Slughorn said. 'It\'s only a Babbling Beverage, and relatively harmless.'

'Shall we get started?' Tofty quavered, shooing his iguana

off his lap and onto the table.

The iguana inched across the surface to swipe at the tip of

Dumbledore's beard with its clawed foreleg.

'I see you're still holding a grudge for that levitating charm, Kanoni.' Dumbledore hitched his beard out of the way of the iguana. 'You will remember to vanish anything Harry conjures this time, won\'t you, professor?'

'Of course, Albus. I rarely make the same mistake three times, but so long as Mr Potter does not set *another* giant swan upon me, I will count myself lucky. You deserved every detention you received for that, no matter how majestic a creature it was.\'

'As you can see, Harry.' Dumbledore shot him a rueful smile. 'Our teachers will always remember us as the foolish young men we all once were.\'

Slughorn chortled into his hand. 'A swan, Albus? Really?' 'In my youth I often gave in to the temptation to show off,'

Dumbledore confessed. 'It was an excellent piece of magic, but

perhaps unnecessary.'

'Transfiguration first,' Tofty said. 'I\'d like you to perform a partial, human to animal transfiguration upon yourself if you can.'

McGonagall pursed her lips and shut all the windows with a flick of her wand.

Harry pushed ebony feathers out through his skin and turned his hair into a crown of dark plumage.

'Excellent!' Tofty cried. 'I would ask you to conjure something animated, but I have the records of your OWL exams here, and frankly it seems pointless to ask you to do it *all* again, so if you

could untransfigure yourself, I will have only one more task in this subject for you.'

Harry shed his feathers. 'Done.'

'I would like you to transfigure this---' Tofty held up a small apple '---into a clock.'

Harry levitated the apple into the air between them, picturing a simple, wooden clock in his mind, and directing his magic through his wand. The stalk of the apple lengthened, splitting into two to form elegant dark wooden hands and the apple itself flattened out to form the face, shifting into shining amber.

'Amber.' McGonagall's lips curved a fraction. 'Most well done, Mr Potter.'

'Well done, indeed.' Tofty reached out and picked it out of the air, then shuffled his feet. 'Do you mind if I keep it? Something for me to have to remember you by when one day I read of your accomplishments.'

'Of course not.'

'Very kind of you, young man.' Tofty tucked the clock into his bag, then scribbled away on his clipboard and turned over the first sheet of parchment. 'Onto Charms.'

Flitwick shuffled around Slughorn\'s protruding stomach.

'You ought to have no trouble here, Harry.'

'If you could fill this with water for me.' Tofty conjured a simple glass vase. 'Non-verbally if at all possible.'

Harry stuck the tip of his wand into the vase and filled it with water.

'Wonderful.' Tofty hefted the full vase onto the desk. 'Now for multiple, non-verbal charms. I want you to freeze, levitate, and change the colour of *just* the water.'

Harry charmed the water green, levitated it above the vase, and froze it into a solid, emerald orb. *Easy.*

'Excellent.' Tofty scribbled his way down through the boxes on the next page of his clipboard. 'Just Defence Against the Dark Arts, and I daresay you should be good at this one!' He flicked over to the final sheet of parchment on his clipboard. 'A Shield Charm and a Stunning Spell please, Mr Potter. Silently, of course.'

Harry sent the Stunning Spell into the wall with a flick of his wand and thrust his Shield Charm out the moment the red beam flashed forth.

Tofty gaped. 'Did you cast them simultaneously?'

Dumbledore chuckled. 'Not quite, professor. I'd an old friend who liked to do the same thing when he duelled, only with two different offensive spells. Harry cast one when his wand was outstretched and the second without wand motions as he lowered it.\'

*That\'s an even better idea.* Harry cocked his head. *You could cast twice as many spells doing that.*

'I don\'t remember any of your friends displaying that in their exams, Albus.' Tofty frowned. 'Have I heard of him?'

'He wasn\'t educated here in Britain. He was a pupil of Durmstrang.' Dumbledore smiled. 'And you have most definitely heard of him, he was among the most brilliant wizards I've ever met and the finest duelist I've ever seen.'

'Well,' Tofty quavered. 'It\'s a shame I didn\'t meet him, then, I should've liked to ask him how he came up with it.'

'He resides quite a way away. I visit him from time to time, since he cannot come to visit me, and our discussions are as stimulating now as they were when we were young, more so, even, now he has gained greater perspective.'

*He must be very old, too.*

Harry slipped his wand back into his sleeve. 'Am I done?' 'The only other thing I'm supposed to ask is if you can

produce a Patronus Charm for me.' Tofty let out a wheezing laugh

and scribbled on his clipboard.

'Are you not going to ask?\' Slughorn enquired.

'I saw Mr Potter\'s corporeal Patronus only last year.' 'I\'m sure he wouldn\'t mind demonstrating again,\'

Dumbledore said. 'Once we can probably get away with, but twice might be a bit risky when the exam report is submitted.'

*So that's why you're here.* Harry let his wand slide back out of his sleeve. *You want to see my patronus.*

'Sorry, Mr Potter.' Tofty set his clipboard down. 'Albus does have a point, there. I should really ask to see it again.'

Harry closed his eyes and let the Mirror of Erised well up before the eye of his mind. Fleur carried a green-eyed silver-haired girl in her arms, a small, soft smile on her lips and he stood beside her, a gleaming band of gold and dark stone on his finger. 'ExpectoPatronum,' Harry whispered.

The anzu exploded from the tip of his wand and soared \'round the room, landing on the desk and spreading its wings, eyeing everyone else with its sharp, silver eyes. Dumbledore studied it, running his fingers through his beard with a faint smile on his lips.

'Well.' Tofty slid his clipboard back into his bag and scooped

his iguana up in his arms. 'That\'s all I need you to do, Mr Potter.

Congratulations.\'

McGonagall tutted and Slughorn chortled into his hand

again.

Harry blinked, dispelling the anzu with a flick of his wand.

*Aren\'t I meant to have to wait for results?*

'If that\'s all, I might head down to Hogsmeade to celebrate with a friend,' Harry said.

'Tell Miss Bell she needs to replace some of the members of the quidditch team, Mr Potter,' McGonagall said. 'And try not to distract her from her own studies. The rules about displays of personal affection are quite clear...'

*I won\'t.* Harry watched Dumbledore pick loose bits of bright fluff off his gloves in the corner of his eye. An ominous little chill prickled down Harry's spine. *There's probably a reason he's not mentioned Fleur to anyone. And I bet I won't like it.*

He headed down toward the courtyard, throwing glances around until he caught sight of Katie waving from beside a column.

'All done,' Harry declared. 'Ready?' 'Did it go ok?' she asked.

'Aced it.' He grinned. 'Where would you like to go first?

Honeydukes or the pub?'

'Honeydukes.' Katie slipped her arm through his. 'We can go crash Nev's date with Hannah at the pub after you've bought me chocolate, and Alicia and Angelina will be about for a drink.' She giggled and pointed down the path through the groups of students. 'Look, there they are, let's sneak after them.'

She tip-toed after Nev, darting behind small groups of students, most of whom were a head shorter than her.

'You're not very good at sneaking.' Harry strolled after her. 'I was so overt I was covert.' She pouted and slinked out

from behind a group of younger girls. 'You\'re not embracing the spirit

of this...'

'Maybe it's because he likes his girls more mature than a

twelve year old.' Romilda Vane strutted out of the group.

\'Oh!\' Katie peered into the gaggle as if just noticing they were there. 'Romilda. I didn\'t recognise you without all that eye- shadow. Why aren\'t you in Hogsmeade with your boyfriend?\'

'I don\'t have one anymore,' Romilda declared. 'He wasn\'t dedicated enough.'

'Ah,' Katie murmured with more than a touch of glee. 'Come, Harry,' she called, catching sight of a huddle of Third Year Hufflepuff girls and grinning from ear to ear. 'There are many students to seduce today, I'm sure we can work around that impotency.'

A touch of heat crept onto his cheeks and the girls flushed, scattering from his path like frightened sparrows.

*Luna Lovegood has a lot to answer for.* He shrugged. *Ah well, in for a knut, in for a galleon.*

'After *you*, Katie.' He shot her a suggestive wink. 'Maybe the impotency is just because I've not found the *right* girl to be my Dark Lady.'

She froze and clapped her hands over her mouth with a loud

gasp. 'Oh no, my precious virtue, what will I do?'

Romilda snorted. 'Everyone knows you don't have any of

*that* left.'

Harry twisted 'round and levelled a cold glare at her.

'Would you like to say that again, Romilda?'

'Sorry,' she whispered, shrinking back behind her friends.

Katie stuck her wand back away. 'I was going to hex her,' she complained as they wandered down. 'I've a really good one, it causes unexpected menstruation.'

Harry blinked. 'Isn't it always kind of unexpected?'

'Well, a bit...' She shrugged. 'It's not a *real* period, just blood, but it'd definitely ruin Romilda's day, if she's even old enough to have a period.'

He eased her toward Honeydukes. 'Chocolates?'

'You\'re buying!' She darted across the cobbles and into the

shop, tugging him by the arm.

'I *did* say I would buy you something,' he said.

Katie eyed the life-sized animated chocolate creatures.

'No.' Harry coaxed her away from those. 'I\'m not wrestling with one of them for the rest of the day.'

'I'm only going to get one small box.' She browsed the

shelves. 'Something tasty.'

'Choose a nice one,' he said. 'I can manage a present every now and again.'

'I won't take long!' Katie bounced off down the aisle,

swapping boxes and rearranging shelves.

Harry drifted toward the end of the aisle, running his fingers over labels. *Animated hot chocolate powder*. *Creates chocolate bubble creatures that last longer the more powder you add.* He tucked it under his arm. *Something for Fleur.*

'A present for me?' Katie popped up behind him, a slim,

brown package tucked under one arm.

'For Fleur. She likes sweet things too, remember.' Harry

studied the corner of the slim dark box. 'What am I buying for you?'

'Chocolate-coated butterbeer creams and Firewhiskey hearts,\' she confessed, opening the box a fraction and revealing two dozen chocolates nestled in white paper.

'Tasty...' Harry reached out a hand and grinned.

'Mine.' Katie batted his fingers away. 'You buy your own.' 'I\'m buying *yours*.'

She batted her eyelashes and played coy. 'Pwettypwease, Dark Master? With a cherry on top?' A wicked little gleam appeared in her eyes. 'I'll let you have *my* cherry on top if you really want, *my lord*.'

Harry snorted. 'You're incorrigible.' He headed for the counter. 'A good thing I'm impotent, or I might be tempted to say yes, then you'd be stuck.'

'Frenchie didn't make it sound so bad,' Katie murmured, catching his arm. 'If she wasn't about, would you *really* be tempted?'

Harry weighed up the glint in her eye. 'But she is.' He pulled her into a one-armed hug and carried on toward the counter. 'Best not to think about *what ifs,* in my opinion.'

'One galleon and eight sickles,' the girl behind the counter

droned, glancing at the label.

'Here.' Harry passed her the correct number of coins and returned the box to Katie\'s arms. 'I bought it, so you can carry it.'

'Hey!' The girl behind the counter perked up. 'Aren\'t you---\' 'Voldemort.' Harry put a finger to his lips. 'But ssssh, I\'m in

disguise. It\'s so hard to get good chocolates when you\'re committing

mass murder and organising a blood purist revolt.'

The counter girl's jaw dropped.

Harry strolled out, Katie in tow.

'Wait.' She caught his shoulder. 'I --- I want to know the answer to that question, Harry.' Her fingers tightened around her box of chocolates until her knuckles turned white. 'I messed it all up, I know, but I want to know if it *might've* worked. In another life.'

*Katie...* He closed his eyes and sighed. *Fleur's perfect and you're, well, you're my best friend, but you're not her.*

'Please?' Katie whispered. 'I know you know. I can't keep

playing pretend and wondering what you're really thinking anymore.'

Harry tried to picture it. He forced Katie beneath willow leaves and before white pebbles, over Fleur's face in the memories of their kisses, and held her body over Fleur's through snatches of heated moments at the Meadow.

'Harry?' She sidled close and took his hand. 'I'm not asking

you to *do* anything. I'd *never* ask that.'

'I know.' He opened his eyes and cupped her hand beneath his. 'The truth is I don't know, Katie. Maybe? All I know is it wouldn't be the same. Fleur's... Fleur's perfect for me. She's *everything.*'

'Everything...' Katie's eyes turned liquid and she blinked

hard. 'But you love me a little bit, don't you?'

'You're my best friend.' Harry reached out and poked her on the forehead. 'Nothing will change that.'

A small smile spread across Katie's lips and she waved her chocolate box at the Three Broomsticks. 'Ready to gatecrash Nev's lunch with Hannah?'

'Definitely.' Harry pulled out his wand. 'Hold still.'

She scrunched up her face and shivered as Harry\'s magic

touched her. 'What're you doing to me?'

'Casting glamour charms.' He smirked, conjuring a flat disc of water in the air in front of her as a makeshift mirror, and rearranging her face a little.

'Oh...' Katie\'s grin turned evil. 'I like the way you think, Dark Lord Potter.' She admired herself in the makeshift mirror. 'I make a hot older woman. Professor Sprout's never looked so good.'

They strolled into the pub together, casting an eye around for Neville and his blonde companion. Harry caught sight of Hannah's pigtails on the far side of the room.

'Over there.' He nudged Katie's shoulder and pointed. 'Go

get him.'

She beamed. 'I\'ll be back in a moment,' she said, mimicking

Professor Sprout's speech.

'Have fun. And Katie dearest---\' he conjured a fluffy, pink, heart-shaped cushion and deposited it into her hands \'---whatever you do, don\'t cause a scene.'

Katie bounced across the floor clutching the cushion until she reached the centre of the room. 'Neville!' She sank to her knees and burst into loud, fake sobs. 'How *could* you!?'

'Professor Sprout?' Nev asked, turning brighter and brighter

crimson.

'I had hoped that the rumours were untrue, but now I see

that my fears are not unfounded. You have left me for a younger woman.' Katie wailed and pulled at her hair. 'Oh if only I'd agreed to help re-enact that fantasy you told me about you and the venomous tentacula.'

'What?' Hannah gasped.

'How could you do this, Nevvie?' Laughter suffused Katie's voice as she thrust her cushion at his feet. 'Surely the arms of this buxom, young blonde cannot compare to the nurturing affection of Herbology. Return to my bosom, to the bosom of mother nature, and the soft, warm soil of the greenhouses.'

Nev caught sight of Harry. 'Harry! Get out here and collect your accomplice before I hex her back to Hogwarts and *bury* her in the soft, warm soil of the greenhouses.'

'Game over.' Harry removed the glamours from Katie, who scampered back to raucous applause, waving her pink cushion about like a trophy.

'Not funny,' Nev groused.

Hannah snickered into her drink. 'It was pretty funny,

*Nevvie.'*

Angelina and Alicia drifted over. 'Hi Katie,' they chorused.

'Neville. Hannah.' They exchanged a glance. 'Harry.'

*Oh, that's why Alicia doesn't like me. It's nothing to do with Rita Skeeter, she's known about Katie the whole time...*

'Girls.' Harry threw a look at Katie, who wilted a little.

'I see you made it to Honeydukes, Katie.' Alicia smirked and

tapped the brown-papered box. 'What did you get?'

'Harry spoilt me.' Katie beamed. 'Though he wouldn\'t let me buy an animated chocolate Grindylow.'

Nev breathed out a long sigh. 'Smart man.'

'He also mentioned Firewhiskey...' Katie fluttered her eyelashes at Harry. 'I'll tell all the Third Year Hufflepuff girls that you aren't really impotent...'

Harry shook his head. 'How about you convince Romilda Vane I *am* impotent instead.' He shuddered a little. 'I *really* don't want to get love potioned by her.'

'Deal! I\'ll head to the bar and get us a round of drinks.' She snatched her chocolates out from under Alicia's fingers and threw a pointed glance at Harry and her two friends. 'Be back in a moment.'

'Time for that conversation Katie wants us to have while she's not here,' Harry said.

'Oh?' Alicia's head snapped \'round. Two spots of pink hovered high on her cheeks and her eyes flashed. 'The one where you pretend you *aren\'t* messing our best friend around?'

Nev leant back into the corner, tugging Hannah with him.

'We're not here,' he said. 'Just pretend we're a cushion.'

'Katie and I are friends,' Harry said. '*Just* friends. And we

both know the boundaries of our relationship.'

'So you\'re aware that she likes you,' Angelina said. 'Katie won't tell us why she knows you'd say no if she asked you. She just says things are as good as they can be and not to do anything.'

*She didn't?* Harry threw a long look over to where Katie chatted with Madam Rosmerta. *She kept Fleur a secret for me even from Alicia and Angelina?* A little warm lump caught in his throat. *Thank you, Katie.* He caught her eye and sent her a small smile. *I wish there was a way you could get what you wanted, too.* The lump in his throat melted away into the emptiness. *But wishes like that almost never come true.*

'I think that's between the two of us,' Harry murmured. 'But Katie's been my best friend since the Triwizard Tournament. Nobody else stuck with me, even if there was a little bit of a mess before the Yule Ball.'

*'You* did fine,' Angelina accused. 'You went with that hot French chick. Katie got ditched by Roger Davies after about five minutes.'

Harry raised his eyebrows. 'I wasn't the one who said yes to Roger Davies.'

'You should've fixed it,' Alicia said.

'Katie should've said no or told him she'd changed her mind,' Harry replied. 'If she had...' The whirl of images from before flitted through his thoughts. 'If she'd gone with me, things might be very different.' He shrugged. 'Now there's only one way it can go.'

Katie meandered across the floor toward them, trailing a line of floating glasses of Firewhiskey.

'Truce, then,' Alicia said, leaning forward and lowering her voice. 'Katie shouldn't have said yes to that idiot Davies and if you don't feel that way about her anymore, then we can't make you love her back.'

Angelina pulled a face. 'We yelled at her for like an hour about Roger Davies, you know, and she just curled up into a ball and cried that it was too late and she'd ruined everything.'

Alicia glanced at Katie as she made her way up the steps to

their table. 'She only ever wanted to go with you, Harry.'

Katie bounced back to their table and the little shot glasses floated down onto the table. 'I got them.' She pulled the slim, dark box out from under her arm. 'Madam Rosmerta was feeling chatty, though, so it took me a little longer than I expected.\'

'We\'re all sorted,' Angelina said. 'Harry\'s a nice guy, he\'s not

messing you around, you were right all along, and we\'re sorry.'

'Well, that totally ruins my I told you so.' Katie waggled the box. \'Chocolate? I\'m feeling generous...'

'Well, if you\'re going to be so kind as to offer me one of the chocolates I bought you...' Harry grinned at her. 'I guess I'd have to say yes.'

'Nothing for Harry, then.' Katie tugged off the lid and tossed it aside. 'Girls?'

'Yes,' they replied. 'What chocolates are they?'

Katie plucked a chocolate heart out of the box and slipped it

into her mouth. 'Firewhiskey hearts and butterbeer creams.'

'Still an alcoholic...' Alicia shook her head. 'We need to get you help, babe.'

Harry laughed. 'Too late for that.'

'Mind if we catch up?' Angelina asked, gesturing to Alicia and Katie. 'It's been a while...'

'Go for it.' Harry stole one of Katie's chocolates and blew a

kiss at her look of outrage. 'See you later!'

*Let's go surprise Fleur with some good news.* He apparated back into his study with a soft snap.

A spread of parchment stretched across the floor, covered in endless columns of small blue-inked runes linked by rows of small red-inked runes.

'Get off my paper, monCœur.' Fleur shooed him off it from behind, then the sheet of parchment rolled itself up against the wall. 'I was studying your cloak.'

'I could've sworn you said *washing,*' Harry quipped. 'Did you find anything?'

'Not really,' Fleur said. 'I've been trying to write a runic description of what I can feel and what Gabby said she felt, but I'm mostly making it up as I go. I think I could probably study this for the rest of my life and still not completely understand how it works.'

'Well, I need it back.'

Fleur pouted. 'How did your NEWTs go? And your meetings with Dumbledore?'

'My NEWTs went well,' Harry said. 'Potions was hard and so was the written part of Charms, but I certainly passed.'

'Did you get an Outstanding?' Fleur rose to her feet and slipped her arms \'round his neck, resting her elbows on his shoulders. 'In all of them?' A smirk graced her lips. 'I did...'

'In three, I think,' Harry said. 'I got *four.*'

'I have a Triwizard Trophy,' Harry retorted. 'I have better OWLs, too.'

'I steel \'ave a Triwizard Trophy.'

'You\'re supposed to pick a new thing,' Fleur said, switching to French with a broad smirk. 'And my English accent is a *lot* better than your French one.'

'That's very true,' Harry replied in Parseltongue. 'But I can speak to snakes and you can't.'

'What did you just say?' Fleur demanded.

'You mean you didn't understand?' Harry feigned a frown, struggling with his grin. 'But Gabby told me that using my Parseltongue would make you the happiest girl in all the world if I did it right.'

Fleur threw her head back and laughed. 'I think you and my little harpy of a sister need to manage a five minute conversation without some kind of sordid joke.'

'I don't think that's possible,' Harry said. 'My intuitive understanding of Gabby through our shared veela-mate-soul-bond is that all veela are really sex-crazed and can't manage not thinking about it for even a few minutes.'

Fleur huffed. 'She is *not* your veela-mate *or* your soul-mate,

monCœur---\'

'Both?'

She dragged his mouth down to hers. 'Does she kiss you like that?'

'Not that I can recall,' Harry murmured, slipping his arms 'round Fleur's waist. 'Are you getting jealous again, mon Rêve?'

'I am *always* jealous.' Fleur turned her nose up and a small smile curved her lips. 'You belong to me and nobody else.' She held his eye, a serious gleam in her blue eyes. 'Until death do us part.'

*The Resurrection Stone.*

'The last enemy to be destroyed is death,' he whispered, holding her close. 'I found it, you know.'

'Found what?'

'The Resurrection stone.' He pressed a kiss to her cheek. 'I found the Resurrection Stone.'

Fleur\'s eyes widened. 'Show me.' 'I said I found it, not that I have it.' 'Oh.' Fleur's face fell. 'Where is it?'

'Currently?' A little ice crept into his tone. 'On the finger of Albus Dumbledore. It won't be there for long. He and I are going horcrux hunting together soon, then Nev and I are going into Gringotts. If all goes to plan, I can steal the ring afterward and come back here, and then the only things between us and our sunset are a snake and Voldemort.'

'Wipe them all away,' she whispered. 'As soon as you can. When they're gone, it will be just us beneath the willow tree, like the summer.'

'You make it sound so easy,' Harry murmured.

Fleur shrugged. 'It's their dreams or ours.' Her fingers slipped to the curve of her stomach and a faint smile crossed her lips. '*They* made it that way, too, monCœur, so don't feel bad. It's their fault if they lose at their own game.'

'I don't feel bad.' He placed a hand over hers and she

gasped and twitched. 'Are you okay?'

She bit her lip. 'I'm okay.' Her voice dropped to a whisper. 'After those couple of risky times, I thought about the consequences a bit...'

*And would it be such a bad thing?* Fleur's voice welled up in the back of his head and a green-eyed girl tossed her silver hair over

her shoulder and beamed at him from behind cold glass. *No, it would be a perfect thing.*

'You said it wouldn't be so bad,\' she said, staring up at him

through a veil of her silver hair.

Harry pulled her close. 'I've one more secret for you,' he whispered, cradling her head against his chest. 'There were other things in the Mirror of Erised when I saw it in the Department of Mysteries.'

'What?' Fleur breathed. 'Tell me...'

\'There was another girl in the mirror.' Harry felt her tense and ran his fingers through her hair until she relaxed into him. 'She'd silver hair and looked so much like you I thought she was Gabby, but when you picked her up, she turned to look at me and she had my eyes...'

'A little girl.' Fleur's arms tightened and she buried her face in the crook of his neck. Her eyelashes brushed against him and something hot and wet dripped onto his skin, trickling down over his collarbone into his clothes. 'We're quite young, monCœur, are you sure?'

A stab of panic lanced through him. 'It doesn't have to be a

dream for now, Fleur. I can---'

She put a finger to his lips. 'One day there'll be a little green-eyed girl with silver hair, there's just a certain question you'll have to ask me once we're free.' Fleur drew back and smiled up at him through the tears sparkling on her lashes. 'For my parents' sake. For me, it's a promise we've already made.'

His breath caught and his heart lurched in his breast. *Does she mean?* He turned it \'round in his head, pulling apart her words. *There's nothing else she can mean.*

Harry forced himself to draw in a long breath and calmed his pounding heart. 'I guess I'll have to plot something with Gabby.' His voice shook. 'I'm sure we can manage something.'

Fleur pressed kisses to every part of his face she could reach and her fingers curled into his clothes. 'Want to do something *risky,* mon Amour?' A wild gleam burnt in her blue eyes. 'Maybe quite a few times?'

'Let me think...' Harry gave her a smile and a wink. 'Yes. *I do*.'

She hauled his mouth down to hers and crushed herself into him, shimmying the straps of her sundress off her shoulders and tugging his clothes away. 'Those are *my* lines you're stealing, monCœur,' she murmured between kisses. 'Now you're going to have to make it up to me.'

# The Remains of the Day

Chocolate bubbles swirled in her mug. A flock of birds burst from the steaming surface, wheeled around above the rim, then plunged back into the cup.

'Cute,' Gabby said, leaning forward to peer into her own.

'Did you make it?'

'Harry bought it for me,' Fleur said. 'It's great until you try and actually drink some of it and get a faceful of chocolate manta rays.'

Gabby giggled. 'Are you sure you're not meant to wait?'

'For three minutes.' Fleur watched tiny dolphins swim in

loops within her drink. 'Then it stops, but I keep forgetting.'

'It's cute, though.' Gabby swirled her mug and pouted. 'You didn't give me any.'

'It's mine, little chick,' Fleur said. 'A present from Harry.' Gabby stuck her lower lip out a bit further. 'S\'il*teplaît*?' 'Non.' Fleur pulled her mug out of Gabby's reach. 'Put that

pout away, you greedy harpy. It's not worked on me since you were

about nine.'

'It was worth a try,' she chirped.

Fleur gazed out the window and watched the drizzle swirl in the wind and the buffeting of the long grass. She cupped her mug between her hands and raised it to her lips, taking a long, slow sip of rich, warm chocolate.

'Did you talk to him?' Gabby asked.

'I talk to him a lot,' Fleur replied. 'But yes, I did.' 'And what did he say?'

She set her mug down on the coaster, straightening it so the handle ran perpendicular to the coaster's edge and smothered a little niggle of guilt. 'I told him it wasn't *that* risky beforehand.'

'*Fleur!'* Gabby's grey eyes darkened. 'That's *not* what I said

you should do!'

'I want it to be a surprise,' Fleur whispered. 'I want it to suddenly brighten up an ugly, shallow world in a perfect moment he will never forget.'

'But you're manipulating him into it,' Gabby said. 'And you don't *know* it will happen how you see it in your head. He's *my* age, he might not be ready. *You* might not be ready.'

Fleur narrowed her eyes. 'I do. I know him. I know him better than *you,* Gabrielle. He is *mine.*' A little smile crept onto her face. 'And besides, he told me he saw a girl with silver hair and green eyes in the Mirror of Erised, so I was right. As always.'

Gabby sighed. 'And what happens when you get it wrong?

You're not *always* right. You know you're not.'

A little chill prickled down the back of Fleur's spine. 'He will

*never* leave me. He can't.'

'Only because he believes you're different, Fleur.' Gabby shoved her mug out from in between them. 'If you manage, somehow, to convince him you're not, then you know what will happen.'

'It won't happen.'

She muttered a few choice words under her breath. 'Let's pretend you do. It's not like he's not had doubts before, is it? What will happen if he doubts? Say it, Fleur.'

Fleur clenched her fists and let little white feathers slip

through her skin. 'Non.'

Gabby rolled her eyes. 'Fleur...'

Fury flashed through Fleur's veins. The white feathers burst into full plumes and her beak thrust from the liquid heat at her lips. 'Non! I don't want to! It won't happen!'

Gabby plucked her mug off the side and threw the contents

in Fleur's face. 'Don't go all birdy at me! I'm trying to help you!'

Fleur clawed the hot chocolate off her face and forced

herself to shift back. '*Gabrielle.'*

'Shut up, Fleur.' Gabby vanished the mess and glared at her with pitch-black eyes. 'Shut up and listen to me. If you're too stubborn to say it yourself, then I'll say it. He will doubt at the first hint of you not being what he hopes you are, *because that is how he thinks,* then he'll tell himself there's no reason to doubt, but he'll spend every second seeking reassurance. If you don't provide it, he'll get worse and worse, until, eventually, if you still don't, he'll come to me again, because I know you best. What should I tell him? You thought manipulating him into getting you pregnant would create some perfect moment for you both to share?'

'You tell him that I will never leave!' Fleur hissed, balling her trembling hands. 'He's *mine.* I am *his.* All the ugly, selfish little people and their shallow dreams are nothing compared to something

perfect. One *moment* of perfection is worth however much it hurts to

have it.'

'Fleur...' Gabby reached out and took Fleur's hands, smoothing the shaking from her fingers. 'It doesn't *have* to hurt. You even said he wants it too, just *share* it.'

'It already hurt.' Fleur took a deep breath. 'If it was easy, it wouldn't be worth having.'

'Fine, then it doesn't have to hurt *more*.' Gabby sighed. 'I love you, sister, but your head is not screwed on straight. You don't *have* to make it hard.'

*Stupid Gabrielle.* Fleur tugged her hands back from her sister and clutched her warm mug to her chest. *I hate it when she's right.*

She took a deep breath. 'Actually, little chick, you *do* have to

make it hard. Maman's books were *very* clear on that.'

Gabby giggled. 'And *very* descriptive.' She caught Fleur's eye and held it as the dark faded from her irises. 'Share the dream, Fleur. It won't make it mean any less if it's not a surprise. If anything, surely the anticipation will make it better for you both. There'll be more than one perfect moment that way.'

'I'm not going to say that you're right,' Fleur muttered. 'I am

*not.*'

'And you won't say thank you, either.' Gabby kicked her in

the shin under the table. 'You *still* haven't said thank you to me for making you write to him.'

Guilt gnawed at her stomach. 'Thank you,' she whispered. 'For that. And for this. And for when Harry was panicking before. I *am* grateful.'

'I know.' Gabby smiled and scooted her chair \'round next to Fleur's. 'It's okay to make mistakes, you know, and to tell Harry things even if you're not sure whether he will think it's perfect or not.'

Fleur shook her head. 'I can't make a mistake. I know I can't.

One mistake and he won't think I'm perfect anymore. And if he doubts, then he won't just talk to you, he'll talk to Katie Bell. He *trusts* her, if he doubts me and listens to her, she'll *steal* him.'

'Who?' Gabby asked.

'The girl he dated before,' Fleur snapped. 'She makes the same kind of jokes that you do, only *she* isn't really joking. I would hate her, but she's important to Harry, so I just can't...'

A glimmer of mischief hovered in Gabby's eyes. 'Who said *I*

didn't mean them?'

A peal of laughter escaped Fleur's lips. 'You've never been interested in any real boys, little chick. Maman's starting to think you're interested in girls.'

Gabby pouted. 'I just like the feeling---' her eyes turned distant and a wide smile spread across her lips '---it's like when you used to hug me when I was a little. All warm.'

'I'm not your veela-mate, either,' Fleur said. 'Nice try.'

Gabby laughed, then the humour faded from her face. 'You are, though. You and Harry. Sometimes...'

curious.'

Fleur raised her eyebrows. 'Do go on, little harpy, I'm *very*

'Put those feathers away, Fleur.' Gabby laughed. 'I don't

mean the veela sisters threesome. It's just nice to be around the two of you. I can feel the warmth in your magic all the time. It's just... *nice*.' She smiled and stole Fleur's drink. 'I'm very happy for you.'

Fleur snatched her hot chocolate back. 'Not happy enough to not steal my sweet things, though.'

'I don't have one,' Gabby protested.

'Because *you threw it in my face.*'

'You were being birdy.' She giggled. '*Really* birdy, even for

you.'

A loud crack echoed through the kitchen and Sirius

stumbled into a chair, clutching at his side.

Fleur sighed. 'I told you not to apparate about if you can avoid it, it'll make it worse.'

'Bugger that,' Sirius growled. 'Greyback's dangling Moony's body from the church tower at Godric's Hollow. Dumbledore forbade me from going, but bugger that old fossil, too.'

'You're in no state to duel.' Fleur pointed a finger at the wet patch spreading across his robes. 'Your ribs are seeping again.'

'Well bugger them as well.' Sirius thrust a hand into his robes and snatched out his wand. 'Greyback's the only real thing keeping the packs on Voldemort's side, so it's not like it's just revenge.'

Fleur pursed her lips and stood up, pulling her wand out to fix Sirius's leaking bandages. *That's true, but it's almost certainly a trap.*

'We'll go to Godric's Hollow, Sirius, but if we see *any* hint of

a trap, we leave straight away.'

Sirius scowled. 'Why would it be a trap?'

'Because Voldemort would like to take everything away from Harry he can,' Fleur said. 'And *you* are on that list of people.'

Gabby padded across the kitchen tiles and threw her arms \'round Fleur. 'Be careful,' she whispered. 'If you get eaten by a wolf, I'm going to steal Harry away to be my veela soul-mate.'

Fleur rolled her eyes. 'You'll have to fight Katie Bell first,

little chick. Do you want me to take you home or to Beauxbatons?'

Gabby grinned, stuck her tongue out, and vanished.

'Oh great,' Fleur muttered. 'Now she can get into our bedroom.'

Sirius tugged at his bandages and cleared his throat. 'Do you need anything?'

'Non.' She reached out and took hold of his wrist. 'However, you will have to apparate me, I've never been to Godric's Hollow.'

He grunted. 'There's no reason to go there, it's just graves and a wrecked house.'

A loud crack echoed over mist-wreathed tombs, wilting wreaths, and short grass. The church spire loomed over them, sprouting weathered, worn gargoyles. A single body dangled from one, spinning back and forth in the breeze.

'Moony,' Sirius muttered, bowing his head. 'I always thought I'd be the first of us to die and now I'm the last of us left.'

'I ripped his throat out.' A hulking figure leapt upon the top of a marble headstone. 'He challenged me, *man-to-man,* so I beat him until he screamed, then I tore his throat out with my teeth.'

Sirius snarled and hurled bright yellow curses at the silhouette, but it leapt away into the mist. 'Fucking Greyback, I'm going to turn him inside out and peel his skin off!' A dark patch soaked across his ribs and he clenched his jaw.

Fleur closed her eyes and stretched her sense, straining for any hint of magic, or ripple of wards. *Nothing... yet.*

'Where are you!' Sirius yelled, pressing one hand to his chest. 'Coward!'

'I'm a wolf.' Greyback's rasp echoed through the mist. 'But the Dark Lord just wanted you brought here, he wants to kill you himself.'

A handful of black-robed, silver-masked figures appeared with a cacophony of loud cracks and a ripple of magic fell over them.

*Wards.* Fleur closed her eyes and threaded her magic into them. *But not the strongest ones, it'll only take a moment.*

'Lucy!' Sirius yelled. 'How's the face, you slippery little

worm?!'

'How're your *friends,* Black?' a smooth voice called back.

'Most of them are here, like mine. Only mine are *still breathing.*'

Fleur tugged at the wards, re-weaving them, grabbing

Sirius's wrist and apparating them back to the Meadow.

'Damn,' Sirius growled, pressing a hand to his ribs. 'I think I reopened it a bit.'

She pointed upstairs. 'Go put some silver lotion on it, then re-bandage it. I'll try and heal a bit more this evening before you sleep, but it's slow going. The magic in the curse is stubborn.'

'Not as stubborn as I am,' he muttered, plodding up the

stairs.

# A Firebolt from the Blue

Weak winter sun bathed Harry's face in gentle heat between the faint gusts of wind rippling through the top of the quidditch stands. He rested his heels on the railing and breathed out a long sigh.

'Oi!' A shadow drifted over him and Katie's voice cut through the quiet flutter of the breeze. 'You're supposed to be watching for problems in my chaser drills.'

Harry cracked open one eye and squinted up at where Katie hung over him in mud-spattered quidditch robes. 'I never agreed to that.'

'I dragged you down here so you could!' She swooped down

and poked him in the chest with her foot. 'Stop napping.'

'And here I thought you just liked my company...' He sighed. 'Conned again.'

Katie giggled, drifted a little closer and swung herself off the Firebolt, placing a foot on the seats either side of Harry and resting the broom over her shoulder. 'Want me to come keep you *company*?'

Harry leant back from her navel. 'I already have company.' He motioned at the stand below. 'See, Romilda's here. I don't need you. She's all I could ever want.'

She laughed. 'That just means you need me all the more.' Katie cocked her head, and crouched down, grabbing his face and staring him in the eyes. 'Nope, you seem fine. No signs of love potions.'

*Love potions.* He shuddered. *Thankfully, Romilda's just been*

*watching the quidditch practice.*

'Thanks? I'm glad I seem fine to you.' Harry poked her in the stomach. 'You, however, seem dangerously close to being in my lap, Katie dearest, and in the interest of *not* getting immolated by a very jealous French witch...'

Katie glanced down and turned pink. 'Right.' She dropped into his lap, grinning and crossing her legs. 'There, now you'll be immolated, too.'

'Off...' Harry wrapped his hands around her thighs and pushed her into the seat next to him. 'Be good, Katie darling,' he murmured.

'Sorry,' she whispered. 'I was only playing. I wasn't---'

'It's fine. I know.' Harry patted her on the head and mustered a grin. 'But in repayment, you have to give me back my Firebolt.'

'Nope.' Katie clutched it to her breast. 'Are you *sure* you wouldn't rather I wriggle around in your lap for a few more minutes?' She shot him a wicked grin. 'I'll let you see my bra.'

He snorted. 'Is it finally made of seashells?'

'No.' She scrunched her face up. 'That would probably be quite uncomfortable on my nipples and it would rattle when I stick coins in there. It's made of silk. It's quite a nice lacy black one, actually.'

'Sounds expensive.'

'All bras are expensive.' Katie laughed. 'You'll find that out when you first try and buy Frenchie something exciting.'

'I don't think she'll let me,' Harry replied, chuckling. 'Apparently, the only thing I have good taste in is girls.'

Katie giggled. 'You've also got excellent taste in friends and broomsticks.' She hopped up off the seat and snickered. 'Oh look, guess who's coming up to say hello.'

'Please tell me it's not Romilda Vane.' 'It's definitely Romilda Vane.'

'Does she have anything that looks like a love potion?' Harry

asked.

'No,' Katie replied. 'She's wearing *mittens*, though. *Black*

mittens. It's like she can't make her mind up if she wants to be cute or sexy. And her friends copy her, so they've all started wearing mittens, too.'

'What's sexy about mittens?' Harry watched Romilda skip toward them through the empty seats. 'It's not even that cold.'

'Nothing, the sexy is the black. The mittens are the cute bit.' Katie wrinkled her nose. 'Her whole outfit's like it. Short skirt and cute little girl panties. Eyeshadow and cute little girl lip gloss. Sexy bra and cute little girl blouse, even if she never buttons it up to make sure nobody misses the bra.'

'I'm not even going to ask how you know what Romilda's underwear is like.' Harry shook his head and grabbed his Firebolt as Romilda drew near. 'Time to abandon ship.' He swung a leg over the broom and kicked off, hovering just above the seats and holding out his arm. 'Take my hand if you want to live.'

Katie laughed and hopped onto the broom behind him,

sliding her arms around his waist. 'Going to take me for a *ride*, Harry?'

'Hush you.' He corkscrewed backward off the stands and down to the far side of the quidditch pitch, tipping her off the back of the broom and onto the pine-needle strewn grass.

'Ow.' She hopped up and pouted at him. 'That wasn't a very long *ride*, Harry. I'm disappointed in you, you told me you'd learnt a few things\...'

'Not as disappointed as Romilda is.' Harry watched her trudge back down the stairs. 'She didn't even get a ride at all.'

Katie giggled and stole his Firebolt. 'What a lucky girl I am.

Side-chick to the great Dark Lord Potter.'

He chuckled. 'I think Gabby is technically the side-chick.

You're the side-girl.'

'What? Why?' Katie pouted. 'I was here first!'

'It's a bird joke,' Harry said. 'Because they're veela.' 'Ahhhhh.' She bounced on her toes. 'Feathery girls are your

kink, huh? Who'd've guessed?'

'That is not at all true.' Harry chuckled. 'They're kind of cute, though. She gets them when she's mad.'

'Wow...' Katie shook her head. 'Persistent.' 'What?'

'Romilda.'

Harry groaned. 'Fine. I should probably stop running away from a fourteen year old girl, it's not a great look.'

'But understandable. She is *walking* bait.' Katie scrunched her face up. 'The boyfriend she ditched was a Sixth Year and they were definitely doing stuff they shouldn't have in broom closets.'

'I would make a snide comment, but I have no ground to stand on,' Harry replied. 'Although, I did have a time-turner in Fourth year, so *technically\...'*

'Did Frenchie know?' Katie asked.

'Er... No.' Harry shrugged. 'Does that mean it doesn't count?' 'Not for *Frenchie.'* She tracked Romilda's progress across

the field. 'You're probably in the clear, though.'

'Excellent.' Harry grinned. 'Then I can visit Fleur in Azkaban instead of sharing a cell with her.'

Romilda strode right up to them and thrust her cupped

mittens out. 'Here.'

'This better not be a love potion.' Katie frowned and held out her palm. 'Or anything like it. I *will* curse you if it is.'

Romilda opened her hands.

Bright, white opals glittered upon Katie's palm.

She let out a soft gasp, crumpling to the grass. The Firebolt thudded to the ground and rolled across the pitch. A slim trickle of red crept from Katie's ear, dripping from her earlobe into the dirt.

*Blood.*

Katie lay on the green turf, still as stone. The opal necklace snaked up her arm beneath her sleeve, coiling around her throat. The world faded into the distance beyond her.

caught.

*Move.*

Harry\'s heartbeat thundered in his ears and his breath

*Move!*

He bent and touched a trembling hand to her cheek, tracing

his shaking fingertips over cool skin as his heart sank down into a dark, numb place.

*She's not going to move.*

Fury flared in his heart and his wand flashed cold as ice against his forearm. Black mist ripped through his sleeve, lancing across the pitch and shattering the empty stand, spraying splinters across the pitch.

*They took her away from me.* The chill of Harry's wand burnt his skin. Hate clawed its way up inside, a furious swirling storm so sharp it ripped the breath from his lungs; it caught at the back of his throat, a raw soundless scream stretching on until the emptiness swallowed it.

Dark mist swirled around him like a blizzard, slicing through the grass of the pitch and scoring great gashes into the ground; it smashed through the proud quidditch hoops with a steely screech, sending jagged pieces crashing down around them.

A high scream tore at his ears.

*Romilda.* He forced the fury down and whirled about.

The dark mist scattered away like smoke into the breeze and his wand slipped into his fingers.

*They took Katie away from me.*

Harry dragged Romilda to her feet by the front of her blouse and caught her eye. 'Legilimens.' He smashed their thoughts together and let everything swirl into a single howling storm.

Katie giggled by the fire, her feet in his lap, beaming so bright from beneath her messy fringe his heart ached and tears prickled in his eyes. She slapped his wand from his hand so hard it stung his fingers and twirled in a green silk dress at the top of the stairs with a little sigh, her hand pressed to her heart. He lurked behind the door frame with a sour heat burning in his breast and a bitter taste curdling on his tongue. Her tears soaked into his shoulder as he reeled from her words, a small ball of cold settling on his heart. Katie soared above the stands, weaving through Slytherin's chasers, and the crowd roared and stamped their feet. He stared up at her and clenched his fists, hate coiling in his breast.

*He doesn't even notice you, does he?* Malfoy's thin figure

loomed from the shadows of a corridor. *Don't worry. He will. Imperio.*

Harry ripped his thoughts free and dropped Romilda to the

ground.

'Perfect wishes,' she whispered, curling up into a trembling

ball. Her tears trickled down into the dirt. 'Perfect wishes.'

'They don't come true.' He stepped over her. 'Someone

always takes them away.'

*Malfoy.* Ice tightened in his chest; a fist of it crushed the breath from his lungs and tightened around his heart. *And Dumbledore knew. He knew.* Harry clawed for breath. *Of course he knew. The less I have to live for, the more reason I have to die.* He closed his eyes and felt the school close in over him, a great cage of stone and shadow. *And he knows about Fleur.*

'Fleur.' A fist of panic clamped about his throat.

He pictured the kitchen of the meadow and wrenched at the world, catching a flash of opals in the corner of his eye. His heart seized. *Katie\...*

Harry stumbled across the kitchen floor with a great crack. Pain exploded in his left shoulder and blood spurted across the white tiles. His arm flopped beneath the table, fingers twitching.

'Harry!' Fleur threw herself out of her chair, snatching up his severed arm and her wand from her waist. 'Merde.'

He clutched at his shoulder and closed his eyes as the searing agony crashed over him. *It doesn't hurt as much as tearing my soul.* Harry forced his eyes open and watched the blood spray from between his fingers. The kitchen crept away into the distance, as if some invisible hand had dragged the world back from him. *It's just pain.*

Fleur pulled his hand away from his shoulder and held his severed limb against the stump; blood drenched her arms to the elbow and spattered her face as she murmured beneath her breath.

The pain faded.

'Check you can move your fingers properly,' she ordered.

He clenched his hand into a fist, twisting and flexing his arm. 'It's fine.'

She wiped blood off her lips and cupped his cheek with a

hot, damp hand. 'What happened, monCœur? You *splinched*yourself.'

A dull, low ache gnawed away beneath Harry's ribs and he slid down the cupboard to sit on the blood-smeared tiles. 'They took away Katie,' he whispered as hot tears began to blur on his lashes. 'She's gone.'

Fleur sat beside him and drew his head down into her embrace. 'I'm sorry, mon Amour.' She smoothed his hair and held him tight. 'I'm sorry.'

Harry buried his face in her arms and squeezed his eyes shut, wrapping his arms 'round her and clinging to her slim, warm waist. The faint scent of marzipan eased the ache in his breast and his ragged breathing slowed until sleep came to claim him.

# Many Happy Returns

Dead things danced beneath dusk skies; tattered grey spectres rippled in searing hot winds, dragged back into a deep, distant dark.

Harry watched them vanish one by one, ripped from green fields and fading sunlight by the strength of a storm he couldn't feel. Familiar faces twisted into soundless screams, sucked into the abyss.

'You can save us.' A girl of faint, grey mist clung to the long grass, straining every sinew against the silent storm. 'Save us from our last enemy.' She reached out her arm. 'Take my hand if you want to live.'

Harry caught warm fingers in his, clasping the girl's hand.

Gold and onyx gleamed between their hands. 'The stone,' he

murmured.

'The storm,' the girl whispered back.

The deep, distant dark fell away and the searing hot wind stilled. Pink crept up the girl's arm from where their hands joined, colour rippling across her like spells bursting on a shield charm.

'Harry,' Katie murmured, her brown eyes bright and warm

above a broad grin. 'Harry.'

'Harry.' Fleur shook him awake, easing her fingers free of his and flexing her hand. 'It's nearly evening.'

*Katie...* A dull ache chewed away beneath his ribs.

'I don't care,' he muttered.

'It's the evening Dumbledore asked you to go horcrux hunting.' She brushed his fringe back off his forehead and cupped his cheek. 'And it's a bit uncomfortable down here on the floor, monCœur.'

He blinked and squinted across the white kitchen tiles, growing aware of the numbness tingling in his legs and back. 'Yeah. It is.'

'You didn't want to move,' Fleur said, helping him up with a grimace and stretching her back. 'Is it any better?'

Harry sighed and let the emptiness swallow everything.

'No.' He managed a faint smile. 'But I can endure it while I have you.'

'While we have our dream, we can endure *anything*,' she murmured. 'I won't pretend I've felt what you feel, but I know\... if anyone ever hurt Gabrielle---' her eyes flashed pitch black and white feathers sprouted from her skin '---I would melt them like wax and smile as they screamed.'

'Malfoy did it.' A familiar cold fist curled sharp-nailed fingers

'round Harry's heart. 'And Dumbledore *let* him.'

*The stone.* He took a deep breath and honed the ice in his blood to a razor sharp edge. Katie's voice whispered in the back of his ear. *The storm. Our last enemy.*

Harry drew himself up and fixed his ragged sleeve. 'I'll go back. And I'll see her again. I *will* see her. And I'll see Salazar. Death is the last enemy. We'll makeit our final victory.'

Fleur held his gaze with a serious glint in her blue eyes. 'The Resurrection Stone may not work as perfectly as you hope, mon Amour. She may just be a shadow\...'

'A shadow is a start. A shadow is a *soul.*' Harry clenched his fist around his wand. 'I could remake her if I have her soul. Bring her back.' A hot point of triumph flared in his chest. 'A body's just bones and flesh, if I have her soul...'

Fleur's brow creased. 'You know what happens when we wish for things like this, monCœur.'

The air slipped from his lungs and his heart shrank down into the dark. 'I know.' He closed his eyes and sighed. 'They never come true.'

She pulled him forward into her arms and pressed a light kiss to his lips. 'We will try. Together, we'll unravel the magic of the Hallows, but first...' Her eyes bled black as tar, half a finger's length from his own. 'Vengeance. And our sunset.'

'I haven't forgotten.' Harry let himself feel the sharpness of the ice in his chest. 'I learn from my mistakes. They won't have the chance to take anything else away and I'll have the Resurrection Stone.'

'Be careful, mon Amour.' Fleur cupped his cheeks in her hands and kissed him hard. 'He may be old, cursed, and weakened, but he is *Albus Dumbledore.*' Her grip on his face tightened. 'I would demand to come with you, but I know you'll only panic if I do.'

Harry managed a hint of a smile. 'I *can't* lose you. And now

you're the only thing left to take away.'

'Sirius.' Fleur pointed a finger upstairs. 'You still have your godfather.'

'It's not the same.'

A small, soft smile curved her lips. 'I know, but you still have him, and Gabby, too. She will never leave us.' Fleur rested her forehead against his and brushed her silver hair away from between them. 'Be. Careful. Do *not* do anything reckless.'

'No risks, mon Reve,' he breathed. 'Maybe I'll get lucky and the horcrux will do everything for me.'

'I prefer it when there is a plan,' Fleur muttered. 'I have a plan.'

*Malfoy. Destroy the locket. Take the stone.*

Her eyes darkened a few hues. 'Is it more than a handful of

vague objectives?'

'Of course.' Harry watched her irises shift a few shades further. 'Maybe\...?' He waited for her eyes to lighten, sighing as their colour grew darker still. 'Okay, no, it's not.'

She narrowed her eyes. 'If you don't come back here by tomorrow evening, I will come and find you, no matter who's in my way.'

Harry kissed her cheek, breathing in the soft, sweet smell of

marzipan. 'I'll see you tomorrow, then.'

He spun the world back past him and stepped into Salazar's

study.

Silence hung over the chamber, thick enough he could feel

the weight of it pressing down on him. A glint of gold caught his eye.

'I *could* plan, or... maybe I\'ll just get lucky.' He tucked the vial

of felixfelicis into his pocket and strode out. The entire common room fell silent.

'Harry.' Nev leapt up from his sofa. 'You\'re okay.'

'I\'m just *fine*.' Sarcasm poured off his tongue. 'Never been

better.'

'We're sorry,' Ron said. 'About Katie.'

'Romilda's not sorry,' Hermione muttered, fiddling with the

silver chain about her neck. 'She's *catatonic*.'

Harry smothered a flash of cold. 'She's alive, though.'

Hermione sniffed and bit at her lip. 'What happened? All we heard was Katie dropped dead and you destroyed the quidditch pitch.'

'She was killed.' Harry stalked through the room and up to

the dormitories. 'That's all that matters.'

'By who?' Hermione demanded. '*Romilda?*' Her lip curled. 'I

doubt it.'

'You know who.' Harry bit back a short, bitter laugh and left

her behind, sweeping into his dorm.

The Firebolt sat on his bed, not a twig out of place. A sharp pang tore through his chest, ebbing to a dull, raw throb beneath his ribs.

'They found it on the pitch near Romilda and Katie.' Nev stepped through the door behind him. 'I thought you should have it back.'

Harry wrenched the hangings closed. 'I don't want it. I gave it to her. It's Katie's.'

'What actually happened?' Nev asked.

'She was murdered with a cursed necklace,' Harry said. 'It

was M---\'

A soft step brushed out on the landing and he twisted around. Hermione froze just outside the door.

'Wrong dormitory,' Harry said.

'I didn\'t come to argue.\' Hermione leant on the door frame and chewed her lip, wringing her hands. 'I am really sorry about Katie, Harry. I know the two of you were close. I didn't mean to get all demanding back there.'

'What did you come for, then?' he asked.

'I liked Katie,' Hermione murmured. 'I want to know who it was that killed her.'

'Well, too bad,' Harry snapped. 'I don't want you to know.' Hermione huffed, whirled on her heel, and stalked out. 'What now?' Nev asked. 'What will they do?'

'They?' Harry let out a bitter laugh. 'There *is* nothey. The Ministry's hiding behind their wards in London, they're not going to send a single auror or hit-wizard up here because someone murdered Katie.'

*And they'd be too late, anyway*. *I'm going to wipe them all*

*away.*

'She's in the Hospital Wing,' Nev murmured. 'If you want to

'I do...' He glanced at the red and gold hangings of his bed.

'Would you do me a favour, Nev. My Firebolt, Katie\'s Firebolt---' Harry let out a long, slow breath '---take it outside somewhere and burn it.'

'Burn it?' Nev echoed.

'I do not ever want to see it again.' He slipped his wand from

his sleeve and disillusioned himself, striding back down the stairs.

'He was about to say Malfoy,' Hermione hissed. 'I'm sure of

it.'

there.'

'You said Malfoy couldn't have done it,' Ron said. 'He wasn't

'I saw him come into the library an hour before anything

happened. He was there the whole morning, I was watching him.' Hermione worried her lip and toyed with the silver chain at the nape of her neck. 'Whomever it was, it wasn't Malfoy.'

*Of course he was there the whole time. He used Romilda to do it, knowing she hated Katie and would struggle all the more to throw off the Imperius.* Harry strode out of the tower and drifted through the corridors, following his feet to the Hospital Wing.

Rows of empty beds greeted him beyond the doors to the Hospital Wing. A single, still figure veiled in a white sheet lay upon the furthest from the door.

*Hey Katie.* The words stuck in his throat as he edged to the side of the bed and drew back the sheet.

Dull brown eyes stared up at the ceiling through a limp, scattered fringe and cold, pale skin sat as still as if hewn from marble.

*This isn't Katie.* His fingers tightened around his wand. *It's just bones and flesh and blood. A husk of clay.* He dragged his eyes from her face.

Gleaming white opals coiled about her throat, shimmering with faint iridescent light.

He touched the tip of his wand to the largest gem.

Malice lurked within its glimmer, a sharp, patient lust for death; it hung at the heart of the pale stones like silence in shadowed corners, lingering like the stares of old skulls stacked in dark crypts.

Harry forced his magic into the opals and pried the necklace away with a twist of his wand, wrapping it up in a conjured black cloth and dropping it into an empty pocket.

'I'll see you soon, Katie.' He drew the sheet back up over her head. 'I know you're not good at being patient, but, with a little luck, it won't be long.'

# Nemo Malus Felix

Harry twisted the top off the vial, breaking the wax. The Felix Felicis swirled, gleaming like molten gold, and the clock he'd bought Salazar chimed for eight in the evening.

'To the ouroboros.' Harry gave the empty outline over the door a wry smile. 'Never-ending and self-devouring.'

The Felix Felicis burst in his mouth like sparks from a fire, fizzing on his tongue like bright fireworks. Sharp clarity seized him, warm as a friend's hand on his shoulder and gentle as their whisper in his ear.

A broad grin spread across his lips. *This is going to go perfectly.* Harry tossed the vial into the pool and strode from the chamber. *But where to go first?* He weighed up his choices. *The Great Hall, I think. I've a good feeling about the Great Hall.*

Harry drifted through the hurrying huddles of students dashing back to their common rooms before curfew and sprawled across Dumbledore\'s throne upon the dais. He twirled his wand over and over in his fingers, enjoying the rushes of warmth.

*Won't be long.* He tilted the chair backward and swung back and forth. *If he's out sneaking, he'll come once everyone's cleared off.* Harry rested his heels on the table and smiled, watching the stars twinkle upon the enchanted ceiling.

A thin figure slunk through the doors at the far end, creeping along the far wall beneath the windows.

'Draco,' Harry called, flicking his wand at the doors.

The colour drained from Malfoy's face. 'Potter,' he muttered,

tugging out his wand.

The doors thudded shut behind him.

'What do you want, Potter?' Malfoy demanded.

'What do I want? What do I want?' Harry swung his feet off the table and let the chair bang back to the ground. 'To return some lost property.' He turned the table and chair to dust with a touch and stepped through the swirling remnants. 'Funny, how your misplaced property ended up around my friend\'s neck.'

Malfoy sneered. 'You don\'t scare me, Potter. I've stood before the Dark Lord.'

'Fair enough.' Harry strode down the hall, sweeping the tables out of his way. 'It's not your fear I want.'

Malfoy drew himself up. 'So what now, Potter?'

Harry gave him a thin, cold smile. 'Now, we duel.' He dipped

from the waist.

A red beam crackled over his head and burst against the

wall.

'A stunner... And you forgot to bow.' Harry imbued the air

with his magic and wrapped it about Malfoy, bending his spine down

into a full bow. 'It's only polite.'

Malfoy glared and fired a handful of spells at him.

Harry flicked them aside. 'Draco are you even trying?'

Malfoy hurled his wand to the floor, sending it skittering across the stones to Harry's feet. 'Kill me, then. I've been dead for days, for months, what does it matter who does it or how?'

'Realised Voldemort doesn't much care for his servants, have you?' Harry placed his right heel on the surrendered wand and twisted, splintering it into fragments. 'Must've been a shock for you.'

'I hope you all die, Potter. You, Dumbledore, who protects only those he deems pure, and Voldemort, who set me up to die whether I managed to kill Bell or not.' Malfoy's shoulders sagged. 'At least this way it's just me.'

'It's not just going to be you.' Harry levelled his wand at Malfoy's heart. 'You took someone I cared about away from me, so I'll do the same to you. Your father. Your mother. Pansy. *Everyone.* You don't get to pretend there's anything noble in your choice. You die alone, *slowly,* knowing it was all for nothing.'

Malfoy sagged to his knee. 'Would it make any difference if I begged? I will.'

'Beg,' Harry ordered.

'Please,' Malfoy pleaded with dull, tired grey eyes. 'Not my parents, not Pansy, just me. Let it just be me.'

'Just you, then.' Harry wrapped the air around Malfoy and swept him up against the Slytherin banner so hard his ribs crunched. 'You'll be my message. So Voldemort knows what's coming.'

He let out a dull groan. 'It's just pain, Potter. I'm still not scared of you.'

'I don't want your fear.' Harry ripped Malfoy's robes from his shoulders and tore away the shirt beneath. 'Cadent a latere mortem.'

He etched runes of purple flame into Malfoy's skin and watched him writhe and scream as the scent of burnt flesh filled Harry's nose and faint wisps of smoke curled from the letters. 'Consumed by death.'

'Pain doesn't mean much to me either, Potter,' Malfoy gasped through clenched teeth. 'I'll be dead soon anyway.'

'I don't much care about your pain.' Harry levitated the opal necklace up before Malfoy's eyes. 'This... belongs to you.'

Malfoy grit his teeth. 'Just do it.'

Harry looped the glittering opal necklace around Malfoy's throat, holding it a finger's width from his skin. 'Oh and Draco... About your parents and Pansy. You'll see them *very* soon.'

Malfoy's breath caught and despair twisted his face.

Bright, hot triumph coursed through Harry's veins. *That's what I want.* Harry released the necklace and watched Malfoy's head drop with a small smile and a quiet sense of satisfaction. *For there to be no dreams left.*

A bright bead of crimson hung from Malfoy's earlobe; it

dripped to the floor, spattering across the ground.

*Now for Dumbledore and the stone.* Harry slipped his wand into his sleeve and left him hanging there, striding away through to the gargoyle before the Headmaster's Office. *And then.* Katie's voice echoed up in the back of his head. *The storm.*

'Acid pop,' he murmured.

'You remembered the password, Harry.' Dumbledore beamed as Harry stepped into the office, a smile stretching across his pale skin to tired eyes. 'Well done.'

Fawkes eyed Harry up, trilled and hopped across his perch toward Dumbledore.

Dumbledore draped a green and purple-chequered travelling cloak about his shoulders. 'I hope you do not mind if we leave straight away?'

'The faster the better, sir,' Harry replied. 'I don't want to be

out *too* late after curfew.'

Dumbledore chuckled and tapped the rim of the bowl of

sherbet lemons. 'Would you care for a Sherbet Lemon before we go?'

'Thanks, professor.' Harry plucked one from the bowl and paused, seized by a strange urge for another couple. 'Some for later, if you don't mind, sir?'

'A splendid idea, Harry.' Dumbledore proffered his arm.

Harry dropped the extra sweets into his pocket, stepping around the desk and taking a firm grip on Dumbledore's wrist. 'Where are we going, professor?'

'The seaside,' Dumbledore replied. 'Even if it's sadly not

quite the best time of year for it.'

An almost imperceptible snapping sound echoed across a thin strip of sand beneath limestone cliffs.

'There is a cave that holds particular sentiment to Tom behind this bluff here,' Dumbledore said, striding along the seaweed scattering the high tide line. 'It was not easy to find.'

'Why is it important to him?' Harry avoided Dumbledore's footsteps in the sand, picking his way through the thin foam of the surf as it washed back and forth up the beach.

'Because it is here that Tom took his first step onto a very dark path. I told you that I believed he was mistreated, loathed even, before he came to Hogwarts, and once, maybe in the beginning, this behaviour was unwarranted.' Dumbledore sighed. 'Children have amazing minds, Harry; they learn so fast, but, unfortunately, they can only learn what they are taught. Tom learnt to retaliate in kind. One day, when he and his fellow orphans were taken to this beach, he discovered this place.' Dumbledore stopped at the edge of a ravine and pointed down to where the waves dashed themselves between the two narrow bluffs. 'He lured two of his fellow orphans in here and while they never spoke of what occurred, they were no longer the same afterward.'

'How did he find it?' Harry peered into the spray for a hint of dark. 'I can't see anything.'

'It has grown harder to reach as time has passed.' Dumbledore counted his steps from a misshapen limestone spur back across the crest of the bluff and stared across the waves. 'Without magic it may now be nearly impossible.'

'Over there, sir?' Harry asked, squinting down at the foam- spattered rocks. 'It looks... damp.'

'I'm afraid so.' Dumbledore peeled off his bright gloves and tucked them into his pocket. 'I do not think it wise to attempt to apparate across to the doorway, Tom will have likely created formidable defences to guard this horcrux.'

'How about this, sir?' Harry bent down and touched the tip

of his wand to the water and let the cold well up.

The waves froze. Frosted froth flaked and fell onto the twisted mass of ice spanning the narrow inlet.

'Not how I would have done it,' Dumbledore said, adjusting his glasses. 'At my age one starts to worry about falling a little more than is necessary, but effective enough.'

Harry stepped onto the ice and strode across beside Dumbledore, who picked his way through the frozen surf with one eye on the surface.

'Ah.' Dumbledore stepped onto a thin ledge and pulled his pale wand from his sleeve. 'Most ingenious.'

A complex pattern of runes washed across the limestone, bathing them both in purple light.

*Blood magic wards.* Harry studied them. *If you spill blood and agree, you may enter, for a price. Otherwise, you have to break them. A good thing Voldemort used my blood in his restoration. Just as he is immune to the blood magics that were bound to my blood back then, so should I be to any that were bound to his at the time.*

'A sacrifice, I believe,' Dumbledore said, baring his palm. 'The intent of the runes is complex, but I got the impression there was a price to be paid and as this is blood magic, one would assume that price is blood and magic. Crude, but, once again, Tom seeks to weaken and trap trespassers, rather than bar them from entering.'

*The blood and magic isn't the price, it's the pledge.* A strange little urge caught the words on his tongue. *Dumbledore will discover what he's pledged himself to.*

'Coming, Harry?' Dumbledore drew his wand tip across his hand and smeared blood across the runes. 'I suspect Voldemort's attempt to nullify your mother's protection will result in you being able to step through.'

*So he's aware the blood wards at Privet drive are useless*

*against Voldemort. I knew it.*

A violet flash seared at Harry's eyes. 'After you, professor.' He blinked the green afterimages away and followed Dumbledore into the dark.

An eerie green glow permeated the mist hovering over the surface of a vast dark lake, throwing distorted shadows across its surface.

Dumbledore pointed at a small island in the centre. 'That would appear to be our destination.'

Harry bent and touched his wand tip to the water. Magic radiated off it like steam from boiling water. 'I hope you can swim, professor. Voldemort's spent a lot of effort enchanting this place.'

'I think this will suffice.' Dumbledore tapped a rusted length

of chain with his wand. 'I've never been a particularly keen swimmer.'

A small rotten dinghy drifted from the mist.

'That doesn't look very safe.' Harry tested it with one foot.

'Sir?'

'I suspect a great deal of this venture may not be entirely

safe, Harry,' Dumbledore replied, stepping down into the boat. 'Tom does not give up his treasures lightly.'

*No choice, I suppose.* Harry stepped in and stared down into the dark water as the dinghy floated toward the island. *Almost there.*

'Fascinated by your reflection again, Harry?' Dumbledore

asked.

'It's not as interesting as some, but far less dangerous than others,' Harry said. 'I am glad the Mirror of Erised is back in the Department of Mysteries.'

'You found it there?' Dumbledore peered at him with sharp, bright blue eyes. 'Forgive an old man\'s curiosity, but did you see your parents again?'

Harry smiled back at him, buoyed by a rush of confidence. 'I saw a thick, woollen pair of socks, professor. One never can be too careful about the cold.'

'Ah,' Dumbledore murmured. 'I do not, despite what I once told you, see myself with a new pair of socks, Harry, but I did not wish to burden you with heavy things at such an age. No, I see the things that should've been.'

'Oh?' Harry raised an eyebrow. 'No Voldemort?'

'My sister, Ariana,' Dumbledore whispered. 'Alive. Well.

*Restored*. My father and mother, too, with Aberforth, my brother.' 'Your family, sir?'

*Did we once see the same thing?*

'Not just them. I had such grand ambitions as a boy and they've not completely faded. I still wish to see the world I dreamt of, but know now there's a deep, bloody gulf between realism and idealism.' Dumbledore ran his fingers through his beard and peered down into the water with a faint frown. 'Gellert is there, my partner in ambition, my dearest friend, but he is as he should have been, rather than as he became.'

'Grindelwald,' Harry mused. 'Strange to hear you call him

Gellert.'

'We were very young and believed we were the only ones able to change the world into what it should be. After Ariana died, I had to grow up, but Gellert clung to our dream. He wished to make a perfect world.'

'Wishes like that don\'t come true,' Harry murmured. 'Not for a price worth paying,' Dumbledore said. 'Some

sacrifices, Harry, are too dear to be borne.'

*So you let others make them instead.* Harry watched Dumbledore from the corner of his eye, tracing his wand tip through the water as he searched for something to say.

A pale hand thrust up from the lake and Harry flinched back into the boat.

'Best not to disturb the water,' Dumbledore chided.

Harry stared beneath the side. Hundreds of rotting, swollen corpses floated in the dark, circling like sharks.

*They may be a problem.*

He grimaced. 'Voldemort doesn\'t want us to leave, does he?' 'Tom prefers his treasures remain secret.' Dumbledore rose

to his feet as the boat bumped against the island and stepped onto the circle of stone.

Harry jumped onto the rock, keeping one eye on the dark forms drifting through the water around them.

Clear, sparkling liquid filled a shallow basin and a heart- shaped silver locket emblazoned with a serpentine *S* lay on the marble beneath its surface.

'I believe,' Dumbledore said, poking the liquid within the basin with his wand, 'that this has to be drunk, truly *intended* to be drunk, no less, else the liquid will remain in the basin.' His brow creased. 'Perhaps there was more to that price than just blood. I must admit, Tom's knowledge of these magics surpasses mine.'

'In one go, professor?' Harry conjured a glass pitcher.

'I suspect it is not meant to kill, but to weaken, once more.' Dumbledore dipped the pitcher in and the potion flooded into it. 'We will find out.'

*As long as he intends to drink it, I can break the jug and prevent it.* He raised his wand, but the words faded from his lips. *But why should I?*

Dumbledore drained the liquid in one smooth motion and

collapsed with a groan. 'Ariana,' he whispered. 'Gellert, why? *Why?*'

Harry watched him moan, spinning his wand in his fingers, admiring the green light of the lake gleaming upon the gold band on Dumbledore's finger. *Just a little longer.*

'Water,' Dumbledore gasped, flopping to the edge of the

island and ducking his head into the lake.

*Merde.*

The floating, bloated figures froze, then surged toward the surface. Harry dragged Dumbledore out of the water.

'Fire, Harry.' Dumbledore hauled himself up on the basin, water dripping from his soaked beard. 'Use\... fire.'

A rotting corpse trailing tattered black robes clawed its way from the water. Lank, coal-black hair hung over a cracked, engraved silver mask.

Harry banished the inferius back into the water and shoved Dumbledore into the boat. He thrust his wand at the plinth, burying the island in a torrent of scarlet Fiendfyre, shaping the flames into the form of the basilisk and sending it across the lake, incinerating the inferii.

'Fiendfyre,' Dumbledore croaked, tapping the chain with his wand. 'And far too well controlled to be the first attempt.'

'The Triwizard Tournament,' Harry replied, grimacing as the ache of sustaining and fettering the magic started to sap his strength. 'That maze.'

'For the hedges.' Dumbledore sighed. 'It is not a spell I would've hoped to find you capable of casting, Harry. The hatred necessary to want to destroy anything that badly poisons a soul. However, it is capable of destroying horcruxes and I don't think I have strength to cast the magic I used to destroy Tom's family ring, so, in this instance, a necessary evil.'

*I\'m sure you didn\'t want me to be capable of anything*. Harry scowled and smothered the Fiendfyre with a slash of his wand as the boat bumped against the shore. *Martyrs need nothing but faith.*

Dumbledore staggered out onto the shore, stumbling from the cave and apparating down onto the beach with a loud crack.

Harry followed him in a soft snap.

'One less horcrux, sir,' he said.

Harry's gaze fell to the band of gold and dark stone on Dumbledore's finger. *Which means there's only one thing left to do.*

'All things considered, I think this time went considerably better than last time, Harry.' Dumbledore shivered in the sea breeze. 'It's a bit chilly, but I've yet to rashly grab anything cursed.'

A fierce certainty seized hold of Harry and he thrust his wand into his pocket, lacing the lemon sweet within its wrapper with the Withering Curse.

'Sherbet Lemon, sir?' Harry held the paper-wrapped sweet out on his palm.

'Very kind of you, Harry.' Dumbledore untwisted the

wrapper and tugged it off.

'Not really.'

The flesh of Dumbledore's good hand tightened, shrinking

back to the bone. His blue eyes widened. 'Harry, why? *Why?'*

*'Why?!'* Harry let free the freezing fury in his breast. 'How could you ask that? How *dare* you ask that?' He ripped Dumbledore's wand from his sleeve with a flick of his own and snatched it from the air. 'I am *not* your sacrifice. I have no intention of martyring myself for selfish, shallow people who only cared about me if I saved them!' He took a deep breath. 'But I wasn't going to kill you for that. Not unless you forced me to.'

Dumbledore's gaze darted to the pale wand in Harry's fist and dropped to where the flesh of his forearm withered back to sinew and bone. 'Then why?'

'Because you let Katie die,' Harry whispered. 'You let Malfoy kill her, just so I had one more reason to die.'

'Katherine was a mistake,' Dumbledore said. 'Draco's target was me. Severus said so.'

'His target was Katie. He said so. Voldemort's retribution for Bellatrix.'

Dumbledore crumpled to his knees and collapsed on the

sand, rolling over onto his back. 'You killed Draco. And Bellatrix.'

'And more. You tossed your unwanted living horcrux into danger every year, hoping my heroic death and sacrifice would destroy Voldemort. You've got more blood on your hands than anyone I know.'

'Mistakes---\'

Harry bent and ripped the ring from Dumbledore's finger. 'And I wanted this, so I could see them again.'

'You knew...' Dark veins crept up Dumbledore's neck and his

breath turned thin and hoarse.

'About both horcruxes and hallows long before you told me anything,' Harry hissed. 'You let Katie die, you would've let *Fleur* die. You would've reduced me to *nothing*, let the emptiness swallow up all that's left of me.' He clenched his fist around his wand. 'I won't be that again. *Never.'*

Tears trickled down Dumbledore's cheeks and into his silver beard. 'You don't understand. You have to die or else Tom never can. I had to get you to die, I arranged everything.'

'I understand just fine,' Harry snapped. 'You wanted to wind me up 'round some idea of love, then let me throw away my dreams to save the same people that spite me after I save them!'

'Thirteen years of planning lost,' Dumbledore whispered, staring up at the sky as the black veins spread across his face. 'Every time I set you against Tom to make him believe you were his greatest

enemy. Every time I hardened my heart and put you in harm\'s way when I would have given anything not to, just so Tom would one day decide to take your blood for the ritual that would be his only chance at restoration once Nicholas\'s stone was gone.' He took a thin, rasping breath. 'Your sacrifice for others would have been enough to destroy Tom once you were his only remaining horcrux and because he took your blood, your mother's blood magics, you would have lived, Harry, and the fragment of his soul sacrificed in your stead. But you could not know, because you had to truly intend to die, to survive.'

*Thirteen years of planning.* Harry\'s anger guttered out and his blood ran cold. *He always intended for everyone else to live, right until the very end.*

Dumbledore closed his eyes. 'Neither can live while the other survives, Harry. There is no greater act than to die for those we love. All it takes is the courage to do what's right.'

'I'm sorry.' Harry watched the flesh of Dumbledore's throat wither away as guilt churned in his stomach, writhing like a barrel full of snakes. 'I can't lose her. I can't endure without it. It's all there is.

The last perfect wish. If it dies, there'll be no more dreams.'

Dumbledore\'s lips crooked in a gentle smile and he raised a finger, tracing, in white flame, the Peverells\' crest. He blinked, turning the triangle into a shining silver stag, the stone into the ring in Harry's hand, and the line into a familiar, pale wand.

*The Elder Wand.* Harry stared down at it. *All three. Mastery of the last enemy.*

Dumbledore's bright blue eyes caught his. A faint impression of hope fluttered through the barbed tangle of feeling coiled about Harry's heart and a flash of Fleur dancing with him in her shimmering silver dress spun before his mind\'s eye.

*You don't understand. I'm not a horcrux anymore.* Harry watched the light fade from Dumbledore's eyes. *And Fleur doesn't want me to die for her. She wants me to live.*

# Expelliarmus

The first rays of light crept over the edge of the horizon, spilling across the shores of the Black Lake and casting long shadows from the towers and turrets of the school; it poured through the office window, bathing the pale, black-veined skin of Dumbledore's face in a soft orange.

Harry placed the half-moon spectacles on the desk and emptied out the handful of vials of Snape's potion, returning them to the same drawer. *No mystery here. A cursed man who ran out of time.*

Fawkes reappeared on the edge of the desk with a flash of red flame and a cheerful trill, grabbing the spectacles and swooping over to his perch.

'He won\'t be able to play that game anymore, Fawkes,'

Harry murmured.

Fawkes dropped the spectacles back onto the desk, nudging them with one taloned foot, pushing them back toward Dumbledore's hand with his beak and hopping away to watch. Harry closed the drawer to Dumbledore's desk and pulled the ring bearing the Resurrection Stone out of his pocket. Fawkes let out a soft cry and scuttled back across the desk, blinking thick, clear tears onto Dumbledore's hand.

'It's too late, Fawkes.' Harry cupped the weight of the ring in his hand and a twist of apprehension tightened in his breast. 'He's gone.'

*He was going to die anyway.* He stroked the band of gold on his palm. *All those secrets. All those plans. If he'd just said*

*something, maybe it wouldn't have ended like this.* Guilt chewed at his stomach with cold, blunt teeth as he closed his fingers over the ring. *Maybe if I'd said something, but how could I have known to risk it? He would've just lied to me for the sake of his plan.*

A wave of hot magic swirled about the room, rustling papers and rattling the doors to the cabinets. Fawkes hissed, scoring lines into the desktop with his talons and vanishing with a flash of red flame.

'Sorry, Fawkes,' Harry whispered. 'But I have to be free. I can't endure a world without dreams.'

Silence crept in as the colours of the sunrise faded. Harry sat across the desk from Dumbledore's closed eyes and pale face, keeping one eye on the frozen portraits and spinning the ring around on the desk.

*I shouldn't waste my time.* He snatched the ring off the surface. *Now Dumbledore's not here, Voldemort will come for Hogwarts.*

'Let's see what you\'re capable of,' Harry murmured,

touching the tip of his wand to the stone.

A storm of magic swirled within it.

*Maybe Fleur will be able to figure it out, or Gabby.* A faint desire to see it spin seized him and he flicked the ring into the air off his thumb, watching the band glint until it landed back on his palm. *I don't even know who to summon first.* Harry flicked it back into the air and watched it flip once, twice, three times and thud back into his hand. *My parents, maybe.*

'Harry.' The echo of a whisper drifted over his shoulder.

His heart seized and his blood ran cold. Harry swallowed and took a deep breath, rising from his chair and forcing his feet to turn.

Translucent, trembling outlines hung before him like shadows suspended on dust.

'Harry,' his mother said. 'You've grown up so much.'

'I had to.' He clenched his fist around the ring. 'There was no other way.'

'Sorry,' his father murmured. 'We didn't want to leave you alone, but it was that or have you come with us.'

'There's no difference between alone or dead,' Harry said. 'Except when you're alone, you can hope it might stop.'

'You\'re so powerful.' His mother's shade stretched out faint fingers toward Harry's cheek, but her hand passed through him with nothing more than a faint chill. 'I told you he would be special, James. I felt it when I carried him.'

'It's not wise to surround yourself with the dead, Harry,' his

father said.

'Don't depend on the dead for company,' his mother whispered. 'Call on us, on Katie, or on Salazar, but don't cling to us.'

*How does she know about Katie or Salazar?* His heart sank down into a dark, cold pit. *It's not their souls, is it? It\'s just an echo of what I want.*

He let them fade away, turning the stone once more to call on Cadmus Peverell. Harry waited, glancing around, but no shade appeared, so he tried several more famous wizards.

*Perhaps I have to have known them.*

He flipped the ring thrice, running through names. 'Bellatrix Lestrange.'

A small, smiling child of thick grey fog swayed before him, her lustrous curls toppling across one side of her face. 'Baby cousin!' She beamed and bounced on her heels. 'You killed me! Well played!'

'You lost,' Harry said.

'Bella was always going to lose eventually. Bell always said so. Nobody wins forever.' She twirled on the spot and clapped her hands together. 'It's such a shame you didn't want to come play with me. Games are much more fun together.'

*Just one more.* Harry turned the ring back over, gripped by a sudden whim.

'Albus Dumbledore,' he murmured.

'Harry.' Dumbledore's shadow sat upon the edge of his desk. 'What would you have me say?'

'What do you know about the Deathly Hallows?' Harry

asked.

'I know what you know,' he said. 'Or, I suspect, I know what

you think that I know.'

'An echo,' Harry murmured. 'Not a soul.'

'Souls and echoes are not so far from each other,' Dumbledore said. 'Perhaps, if you knew them well enough, the echo might be strong enough to be half a soul.'

'But not sentient, not really alive, not really *her*.' Harry slumped back into the chair. 'I'm never going to see her again, am I? She's gone.'

'An echo is better than a husk of clay,' Dumbledore's shade

replied.

'Tell me about the Hallows,' Harry said. 'Talk about

something else.'

'I believe they are aspects of death, created, as the oldest spells once were, by simple emotion and intuitive understanding. Though, in their case, I suspect it to be the cumulative understanding and feeling of many wizards and witches. Since their creation, they've been explained away by many stories and claimed by wizard after wizard.'

'Gabby told me this.' Harry pulled the Elder Wand from his sleeve and studied the tiny runes making up the pattern spiralling along its length. 'She thought they *were* death, or, at least, they were what their creators thought death was.'

'The cloak -- invisible, intangible, undetectable and unstoppable. Just as death is. The stone -- lingering sorrow, regret, loneliness and grief. Just as death brings. The wand -- powerful, terrible and coveted. Just as death is.'

'Gabby will be so happy to hear you agree with her,' Harry

muttered beneath his breath.

Dumbledore's echo chuckled. 'Perhaps young Gabby will be

more pleased to hear that you think I would've agreed with her.'

'I am sorry,' Harry said. 'I'm sorry I killed you and I'm sorry I can only say this to an echo.'

'We all make mistakes, Harry,' Dumbledore's shade said. 'I have made many myself. And those of us who are powerful make mistakes with greater consequences. Nobody can live without harming another in some way at some point. To intend no harm is good, but to do as little as possible is better.' He smiled. 'And, for all that you've endured, you're not Tom. We're all a little selfish, my boy, but while we care for others, we remain capable of making the best choices. Love, Harry; it so often makes the difference.'

*A dangerous echo.* Harry turned the ring over and watched Dumbledore's figure flicker away. *I will not call him again*. *If he's what I think he should be, then even his shadow will want to convince me to martyr myself.*

He slipped the ring onto his finger and tucked the Elder Wand up his other sleeve, sweeping the cloak over himself and unfreezing the sleeping portraits.

*Breakfast time, I think*. A fierce certainty seized him*. The*

*Great Hall's definitely the best place to go back to.*

Dumbledore's grandfather clock chimed and the certainty

drained away like water through his fingers.

Harry frowned. *The Felix Felicis's time is up.*

He strode down into the corridors, pulling off the cloak and tucking it away.

*Let's see what happens, I suppose.* Harry smothered a faint, nervous churning in his gut. *Trust the liquid luck.*

Silence fell over the Great Hall as he stepped in. Every eye turned to fix itself on him.

*Just like when my name came out of the Goblet of Fire. They never change.*

'Mr Potter.' McGonagall stood up from her seat at the table. 'Up here if you please.'

Harry strolled down through the tables. 'Professor?'

McGonagall drew herself up. 'There is no evidence to implicate you in the horror that has taken place this night. However, it has been brought to my attention that a lot of people whom you have a motive to harm get hurt and thus, for the safety of the students, I hereby expel you from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.'

*That wasn\'t part of the plan.* Harry smothered a scowl. *But, I suppose I'll have the qualifications I need in a few days and now I can't be here, I can just go back to Fleur.* A flash of inspiration struck. *Of course, it's what I wanted most. Felix Felicis.*

'Your wand, Mr Potter,' McGonagall murmured. 'Your NEWTs aren't official and you're not yet seventeen. Your parents would be heartbroken to see me do this, but I think it must be done.'

'I'm fond of my wand, I suspect I'll need it.'

'It is the *law*, Mr Potter.' McGonagall thrust out her hand. 'Your *wand*.'

Harry studied her outstretched fingers. 'Goodbye, professor.' He turned on his heel and strode back through the tables, glimpsing Hermione's relieved face.

*Brought to your attention.* He paused, mid-step. *Just like she did with my Firebolt.*

'It seems I must leave,' he called, catching Hermione's eye. 'However you will find that I will only *truly* have left this school when none here are loyal to me.'

A flash of outrage crossed her face.

*Voldemort will attack here soon now Dumbledore's dead.* Harry continued on his way out. *And I bet you'll all come crawling back begging for a hero to save you when he does.* He allowed himself a small, thin smile. *But you threw me away when you thought you didn\'t need me anymore. You hated me for being what you wanted me to be. You don't deserve a hero. And you're not going to get one.*

Harry strode out across the ruined quidditch pitch, skirting the jagged pieces of metal sprawling over the scarred, splinter- studded ground to the edge of the pines and apparated back into the kitchen of The Meadow. 'I\'m home.'

'Welcome back, darling,' Sirius's gruff voice cried and a pair of arms wrapped around his shoulders. 'Would you like a big kiss?'

'Would you like to get off?' Harry asked, prying himself free. 'You're not nearly pretty or French enough to be kissing me.'

'How was school, honey?' Sirius asked. Harry grinned. 'It was great. I got expelled.' Sirius sputtered. 'What?! Why?'

'Malfoy.' Fleur swept into the kitchen brandishing the morning\'s paper, her eyes black as pitch. 'Malfoy is why.'

*Merde.*

Sirius took one look at Fleur's dark irises and shot Harry a grin. 'Every man for himself,' he said, vanishing with a loud crack.

'Idiot.' Fleur glared up at the creaking landing above their head. 'I told him *not* to apparate, it makes his injury worse.'

Harry patted down his pockets, but found only a lemon

sherbet. 'Sweet?' He held it out.

Fleur plucked it from his fingers and held it up. Bright, azure flames melted it to a thin wisp of white smoke.

'That was the only one I had,' Harry said.

'I'm not a pet to be bribed with sweet things every time you want forgiveness.' Fleur prodded him in the chest with her finger. 'I *told* you to be careful. And you hung Malfoy's mutilated body in the Great Hall of the school!'

'In my defence, the sweet things usually work.' Harry took a quick step back as feathers exploded through Fleur's skin. 'And, also in my defence, I drank the Felix Felicis, so I'm almost certain I was following its lead when I did that.'

Her eyes narrowed. *'Explain*.'

Harry offered her a small smile. 'Well, I didn't really want to be at Hogwarts. I wanted to be here with *you*. While I could stay at Hogwarts, doing so would've probably been the smart thing to do, especially before I'd got my NEWTs. But now I'm expelled, I get what I want.' He stepped forward and tapped her on the nose with his fingertip. 'You.'

'Idiot*,'* Fleur murmured, her eyes fading back to blue and the white feathers slipping back beneath her skin. 'Did you at least get the Resurrection Stone?'

Harry pulled the ring from his finger and passed it over. 'Here. I can't make anything of the magic, but you or Gabby will probably be able to do better.'

Fleur poked it around on her hand with the tip of her wand. 'Something to play with later.' She handed it back. 'What about Dumbledore?'

Harry sighed. 'I killed him.' He took a deep breath. 'And, well, I thought he meant to martyr me, to blinker me and toss me away to die, but he wanted me to live, I just couldn't know, or it wouldn't have worked.'

'And you still killed him?' Fleur asked.

'I didn't know until after it was too late.'

She stepped close and caught the hand holding the Resurrection Stone between hers. 'Once he knew you knew, he might've not believed you could survive any more, and resorted to just killing you. He was dying anyway and you couldn't have known.' Fleur raised his fingers up and pressed a kiss to his knuckles. 'That's what happens when you keep secrets you shouldn't be keeping, monCœur.'

'I don't have any secrets from you anymore,' Harry promised. 'Well---' he shot her a grin '---I won't in a moment.'

A faint pout crept onto Fleur's lips. 'What last secret is left, mon Amour.' She pulled his arms around her and nestled into his chest. 'I warn you, if a single word about veela-mates or soul-bonds or veela sister threesomes comes out of your mouth, I will turn you to ash.'

'It's nothing to do with those.' Harry kissed her on the

forehead. 'Although I am *intrigued* by this veela sister threesome

idea, maybe there's something you want to tell me about veela and their families? Has Gabby been telling me the truth this whole time?'

Fleur laughed into his collarbone. 'You can ask my sister about it.' She pressed her lips to his neck, trailing kisses up to his jaw. 'Now, you promised me a secret\...'

Harry slid the Elder Wand from his sleeve. 'I found the third

one.'

'The third\...' Fleur's eyes went wide. 'The Elder Wand?'

He nodded. 'Turns out, Grindelwald probably *did* have it. He

used the Peverell symbol, Dumbledore famously beat him in a duel,

and it was Dumbledore who's been using it the whole time.'

'Have you used any of them?' Her voice dropped to a

murmur.

'The stone.'

'Katie?' Fleur whispered.

Harry shook his head. 'I wanted to test it, to see if it was

really a soul.'

'It's not.'

'Just an echo.' A small, bitter smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. 'A better thing to say goodbye to than a husk of clay, but not much more than that. I suppose I can thank the Felix Felicis for letting me discover the truth before I called for Katie or Salazar full of hope.'

'You still have me.' Fleur drew his arms back around her and pulled him close. 'You'll *always* have me.'

'Not always.' Harry held her tight, squeezing his eyes shut. 'Even if we beat Voldemort and anyone else, there's a final enemy that'll take you away from me.'

'Master of Death,' she whispered in his ear. 'If there's a final enemy, we just need a final victory.'

# For Whom the Bell Tolls

Fleur\'s fingers slipped into his. Harry clung to their warmth against the cold pebbles beneath his feet, the chill of the wind whistling across the Black Lake, and the sharp claws of the emptiness within.

'You could not have known,' Fleur said. 'This is the price for keeping so many secrets.'

A gathering of students, staff and the witches and wizards brave enough to attend bowed their heads as Dumbledore's eulogy ended.

'I don't know whether I should be victorious or sad,' Harry said. 'He would've sent me blindly to my death, but he would've done it so I could live freely afterward.'

'I would mourn the loss of a great wizard, one of the few unselfish people amongst the crowd of shallow ones.' Fleur squeezed his fingers. 'But I would also be relieved, because you weren't a horcrux and if he'd succeeded, our perfect wish would've been snatched away.'

White flames rose high above the bier, sending swirling spirals of smoke shivering across a clear, cold sky. Fawkes flashed into the air above the crowd with a burst of red flame and a low, mourning keen that twisted like a knife in Harry's heart.

*Sorry, Fawkes. I didn't want to take him away from you. It's*

*their dreams or ours.*

A single, bright crimson tail feather floated to fall at Fleur\'s feet and the phoenix vanished in a final flash. The white flames flared

bright, scattering the smoke, and Dumbledore\'s figure vanished beneath cold, white marble.

'A phoenix\'s feather,' Fleur murmured, tugging on Harry's arm as she bent to retrieve it. 'These aren't given lightly.'

'Fawkes\'s farewell.'

'It's a farewell gift for you, I think. Not for Albus

Dumbledore.'

'Are you *listening*?' Harry asked.

'I am not so good as Gabby,' Fleur whispered as the crowd began to leave. 'But the magic of a phoenix is strong, emotive, and easily sensed.\'

'What do you feel?'

'It is hope. Your first wand, it had a phoenix feather, non?' Harry nodded. 'It did.'

'The shards of the heart of your first partner, consumed by basilisk venom,' she murmured. 'This is for a new wand. The phoenix hopes you'll choose to be who you were.'

*But it wasn't real.* Harry picked the feather from her fingers and drifted toward the tomb, abandoning his invisibility as the last of the crowd left. *Playing hero was never real. I just thought it was what I was supposed to be. It's what everyone wanted me to be.*

Fleur's fingers tightened their grip and she faded into view, a soft gleam in her blue eyes. 'Leave the feather behind, mon Amour. Heroes don\'t really get to walk off into the sunset. They die.'

'I know.' Harry placed the feather on the top of the tomb and

watched it crumble to ashes.

The tomb shivered, shimmered, and reformed. A gleaming coffin of crystal encased Dumbledore, throwing rainbows over his peaceful expression.

'My parents\' shades apologised for leaving me alone,' Harry said. 'They thought it would be better than being dead.'

'Isn't it?' Fleur asked.

'I think they're the same thing, really.' He slipped the ring from his finger and stared down at the Peverell crest upon the dark stone. 'It's just that death lasts forever and loneliness might end.'

'Are you going to summon them?' She stepped back. 'I will wait at home if you are. I think it's a moment for you and them.'

Harry nodded and Fleur vanished.

He turned the ring over in his hand three times. 'Salazar Slytherin.'

'You found it!' Salazar's shade shook his snake in the air with

a triumphant smile. 'I *knew* you would succeed where I had failed.'

'It's not what I hoped it would be,' Harry replied. 'I'm starting to think the only thing worse than having this stone would be to have it and lose it.'

'The echoes of souls are small comfort, little more than memories.' Salazar dropped his serpent back onto his shoulders. 'But a small comfort is better than none, and the strong echo of a soul is only a step away from a soul itself.'

'A ghost cannot return, it can only linger.' Harry sighed. 'Even if I found a way to bring that echo to life, it wouldn't be the same, especially not now I know it's merely an echo I'd be creating.'

'I don't *wish* to return, Harry.' Salazar gave him a fond smile. 'I was *your* sacrifice, not mine. I would've liked to see your legacy outshine mine, as all parents wish to see their children outgrow them, but my time is done. It was done a very long time ago.'

A hot lump rose in Harry's throat. 'I've got a long way to go

to outshine you.'

'Not as far as you think. And you'll get there.' Salazar\'s shade rested its hand on his shoulder with a faint chill. 'Don\'t call on me again if you can help it, Harry. Let me go. Dreaming of the dead is no way to spend your life.'

'I'll try,' he whispered, blinking away the tears prickling at

his eyes.

'Harden your heart, Harry,' Salazar said. 'Say farewell. Step

forward. Don\'t turn back. Don\'t even look back.'

'Farewell.' Harry let Salazar's shadow vanish and stared

down at the stone.

*Katie.* He turned the ring over with shaking fingers.

'Harry!' Katie's smoke-like, silver shade shivered into being and stepped close, so close only a finger's width kept them apart. 'I missed you so *much*.'

'I'm sorry,' Harry whispered, holding his palm up before hers until the cool wisps of mist at the edge of her echo brushed his skin. 'I should've kept you safe.'

'I think it\'s better like this.' Katie's bright smile strained her lips and a sadness rose in her eyes. 'I\'m not in the way now. I didn't want to be in the way of you being happy.'

Harry's heart wrenched and hot tears stung his eyes. 'You

were *never* in the way.'

'But you have your perfect dream,' she murmured. 'And I'm not part of it. Little by little, you would've left me behind, until, one day, someone would've said my name, and you'd've realised it'd been years since you'd even thought of me. And I could've lived with that. I just wanted you to be happy, even if it wasn't with me and you never thought of me again.'

'I will never forget you,' Harry promised. *'Never*.'

Tears trickled down her cheeks in slender, silver lines. 'You will, but now I don't have to watch.' Katie blinked her tears away and clutched at his arm, her hands fading through him. 'Not unless you summon me and make me.'

An awful emptiness clawed its way up inside, tightening its grasp on his heart, and tears slid down his face. 'I can't do this. I'm sorry. I can't do it.'

'Don\'t send me away,' Katie begged, her fingers curling through his like smoke. 'I don\'t want to leave you. Don't make me leave. Keep me with you just a little bit longer.'

'I have to say goodbye,' Harry whispered. 'I can't bring you

back.'

'I know.' She closed her eyes and squeezed fresh tears from

her lashes. 'I wish I'd not ruined everything for us. I wish it more than anything.' Katie smeared her tears away with the heel of her hand

and gave him a bittersweet smile. 'But we both know that wishes like

that don\'t come true.'

'I don\'t want to say it.' Harry pressed his fingertips to his ribs, pushing them in until they turned white and throbbed with pain, but the ache in his chest drowned it, smothering the breath in his lungs and snaring the words on his tongue. 'I don't think I can.'

'Then don't say it.' She stepped close, until all he could see were her bright, silver eyes, and tear-filled lashes. 'I dreamt one day you'd kiss me,' she whispered. 'But I knew you never would.' Her lips brushed through his, the faintest chill upon his skin, and the ring slipped from his fingers into the dirt.

The cold crept in from all around him, biting deep, but unable to pierce the numbness.

Harry bent down and scooped the ring back up, Salazar's words ringing in his ears. *Don\'t turn back. Don\'t look back.* He took a deep breath. *I can't do that again. I can't endure that twice. Fleur and I, we need a final victory.*

He apparated back into their kitchen and dropped the ring into Fleur's palm. 'I need something to do, so I'm going to go test the wand.'

door.

'You can test it with me.' Sirius stuck his head in through the

'Where?'

'Voldemort's going after your mother\'s sister and her family,'

Sirius said. 'Greyback's the one he sent.'

'If we know this, it's because he wants us to know,' Harry said. 'Greyback is bait.'

*nothing*.'

'It's another trap,' Fleur said. 'Don't go. You owe them

*It's a test.* Harry smothered a flare of cold fury.

*Dumbledore's gone and Katie's been taken away. Voldemort wants*

*to see what I will do.*

'It would be useful to kill Greyback, without him Voldemort loses his hold over the packs,' Sirius said. 'And if it's anything like last time, what's left of the inner circle might turn up.'

'We could wipe them all away,' Harry muttered. 'Take them

all away from him. It'd just be him and the snake left\...'

'I can't come with you,' Fleur said. 'The polyjuice potion for Gringotts needs to be finished today.'

'I'll keep Harry safe,' Sirius said. 'We duelled our way out of the Ministry together, we can handle one werewolf and his lackeys.' A grim snarl spread across his face and the shadows clustered in his grey eyes. 'I\'ll get ready.'

Fleur tugged Harry close. 'Sirius isn't even close to fully healed,' she murmured. 'Take no risks.'

'I will test the wand, kill Greyback and anyone else, then

return,' he said.

Her eyes darkened. 'Don't lie to me, monCœur.'

'Voldemort will be there, he'll come himself, to see me, even if he doesn't decide to fight.'

'Why?' Fleur demanded.

'He is *curious,*' Harry whispered. 'He's sacrificed *everything*.

He wants to see what I'll become if he can make me do the same.'

next.'

'If you're right,\' Fleur murmured, 'Sirius, Neville, and I will be

'He will be dead before he ever comes close to harming you,

and if he's not, then he'll have to step over my body to try.' Harry smothered a stab of panic at the image of Fleur lying beneath the same white sheet Katie had, reduced to bones and flesh and blood, a cold husk of clay. 'I *can't* let you die---'

Fleur pressed her lips to his. 'Then don't.'

Sirius's footsteps creaked across the landing above and thudded down the stairs. 'Let's go.'

Harry apparated them both onto the street before Privet

Drive.

The Dark Mark hung in the sky over the house, green and

ghastly before a full, bright moon. The neat hedges that'd once caged

him among the roses threw dark shadows across the neat lawn.

He slipped the Elder Wand from his sleeve and felt a clear, sharp thrill wash through him. 'Homenumrevelio.'

Almost thirty red outlines shone around them, skulking in the shadows of the streets, lurking behind bushes, bins, fences and hedges. A small cluster held back, waiting at the far end of the street.

'We're quite outnumbered,' Harry said.

'The more the merrier,' Sirius said. 'Greyback\'s followers don\'t use wands, they revile wizards, but they\'re very strong, very fast, and quite bitey.'

'Don\'t get bitten,' Harry said. 'I\'m not going to walk you every full moon.'

howls.

The red figures hurled themselves forward with gleeful

'I already like my steak rare.' Sirius grinned and hurled

curses at the charging werewolves.

A handful went down, pierced through by fist-sized, smoking holes. Another stumbled to a halt, clutching his belly and screaming as his entrails burst out and looped around his neck. Sirius\' wand gushed vivid purple fire, lashing thin streams of it out each time one darted forward.

Harry thrust his magic into the air, imbuing it with his will, drawing it back toward himself, and swatting the remaining werewolves away down the street.

'Where are you, Greyback?' Sirius yelled. 'Come out and face me, coward.'

'I'm right here.' A deep voice growled from the Dursley\'s

porch.

Harry whirled and unleashed a piercing hex.

Greyback twitched his head out of its path, sneering down

at them. 'You are good at killing weak wolves.' He tossed a corpse from the roof to the street with a wet thud. 'I do not care for killing weak things. Or muggles.'

Harry spared the body a glance. *Dudley.*

'They have no magic. They cannot become one of us.' Greyback dropped from the porch to the street and leered. 'Some are fun to hunt, but nothing more, and that one, that one did not run very fast or very well.'

'You killed Remus,' Sirius hissed.

'The Lupin boy.' Greyback ran a claw through the gaps between his teeth and flicked away a scrap of flesh. 'He was the strongest child I ever turned. The stronger the magic in the child, the greater the wolf, but he was a disappointment.'

'He was a greater man than you will ever be!' Sirius hurled curses at Greyback. 'You're barely *human*.'

'He was pathetic,' Greyback snarled. 'He tamed his wolf, caged it, burying strength he should've embraced. He challenged me as a man and lost. The wolf barely stirred.' Greyback ran his tongue over his teeth and bared his fangs. 'Not even when I ripped out his throat.'

Sirius let out a raw yell and splashed purple flame across the front of Number 4. Windows melted, bricks burnt, and Petunia's prize rose bushes turned to ash. Greyback walked through it with a snarl, his skin smoking, blistering and burning; he healed as the flames died.

*Voldemort carried out a ritual on him.*

Sirius banished him back into the burning building with a

snarl. 'Greyback is mine.'

'I\'ll deal with the others.' Harry shifted his grip upon the

Elder Wand and a shudder of power rippled up his arm.

Werewolves hurtled from the shadows, sprinting on all four elongated limbs, yellow eyes gleaming. Harry closed the air around them like a fist. They burst into a red pulp of splintered, snapped bones and mashed flesh.

The wand shivered in his fingers.

*Aspect of death indeed.*

Greyback's smoking hulk smashed its way out of the house. Melted, twisted, seeping flesh and blackened bone surrounded his burning yellow eyes. Sirius unleashed a volley of orange curses at the werewolf, a wet stain spreading across his ribs.

'Time to go, Sirius,' Harry called.

Four distinct cracks echoed down the street.

Two blank white masks and two engraved silver ones gleamed from beneath the hoods of dark robes. Two short broad figures and two slender ones levelled their wands at him.

*Inner circle.* Harry took a step toward them. *Someone to take away from Voldemort.*

'Avada kedavra,' the nearest of the two short ones growled.

Harry sidestepped the beam of green light, summoning his swarm of butterflies and disillusioning himself. He transfigured the butterflies into steel spikes a few at a time, sending them hissing toward the Death Eaters, impaling the neat, white-painted fences, tearing through straight-edged shrubbery, and smashing shards from hard brick walls.

*Strike from hiding.*

He apparated behind them with a soft snap and abandoned his concealment. 'Lacero.' Harry cast a wordless, motionless piercing hex in the instant between unleashing his cutting curse and bending his wand into the wand motion for the bone splintering curse.

The silver-masked wizard deflected the cutting curse away into an azalea bush, but the piercing hex tore through his thigh and the bone-splintering hex shattered his ribs.

'Fuck,' the Death Eater groaned. 'He's fucking *fast*.

Rookwood, use that mind you're so proud of.'

'Legilimens.' Rookwood's voice echoed from beneath the

other silver mask.

Dark brown hair burnt to dust before Harry's eyes, bright brown eyes faded to a dull gleam, warm, pink skin turned cold and pale, and glimmering opals hung in the dark like the moon in the night sky.

*How dare you.*

Rookwood flinched. Harry dragged them both down into the emptiness and despair.

*Drown, like I drowned.*

Rookwood shrunk into a ball on the tarmac, wrapping his arms around his chest. He stared at his wand and tossed it away. 'If there're no dreams left, then what's the point?'

Harry put a piercing hex through his skull.

'Shit.' The other silver-masked Death Eater stumbled backward and shoved the nearest of the others forward. 'Goyle, get fucking stuck in. Pin him behind his shield.'

Goyle unleashed a barrage of bright orange curses and Crabbe added a hail of yellow ones. Harry deflected them back, sweeping a wave of purple fire over them both and setting the line of cars alight.

The three Death Eaters stumbled from the flames, tearing off burning robes.

Harry thrust the tip of the Elder Wand at the half-molten, charred chassis beside them, tearing it into sharp metal tendrils with a grating screech and lashing them at Crabbe and Goyle. Crabbe dived to the floor, but the metal vines thrust through Goyle's stomach and ripped him in two, spattering the road with gore.

'Dolohov!' Crabbe rolled away across the tarmac, dodging the lunge of sharp metal vines.

Dolohov melted the vines to a puddle and banished the debris away. Crabbe scrambled back to his feet and tore the white mask from his face, hurling it aside and unleashing a torrent of Fiendfyre.

Harry forced his magic into the flames, drowning Crabbe's hate with his own and sending it rushing back. Dolohov poured his own Fiendfyre into it and the conflagration exploded between them, melting the tarmac into a thick black pool. Harry closed the air around Crabbe, forcing him down into the boiling, bubbling tar, and squashing the Fiendfyre with a slash of his wand.

'Fuck,' Dolohov swore, mopping sweat from his forehead with his sleeve. 'How the fuck are you not exhausted?'

Harry allowed himself a small, thin smile, releasing his control of the air and drawing bright white sparks spiralling about the Elder Wand in a crackling rush of sharp ozone. 'Because I'm stronger than you are.' He whipped the arc of lightning 'round as it flashed from his wand, slicing through houses, lamp posts, Dolohov's copper barrier, shield charm and legs.

Dolohov howled as he tumbled to the floor and clutched at the smoking cauterised stumps.

'See?'

Harry disarmed him and crushed his wand beneath his heel.

'The Dark Lord assured us the four of us would be enough,'

Dolohov gasped. 'He said---'

'I think he lied,' Harry said. 'I think he wanted to see what I'd do to you after you failed him once too often.'

'I'm inner circle,' Dolohov spat. 'I\'m not as expendable as those other idiots.'

'You all look quite expendable to me.' Harry glanced back over his shoulder as green light flashed off the windows of the houses and Greyback slumped to the floor.

'Crabbe and Goyle were inept.' Dolohov sneered. 'Rookwood thought his skill at the Mind Arts and his knowledge of the Ministry made him worthy, but he was weak.'

'You're all just sacrifices,' Harry said, drawing a fresh wave

of white sparks to the tip of his wand.

A soft snap echoed across the street as Sirius limped to Harry's side, one hand pressed to the spreading dark stain on his robes.

Voldemort's form curled together like wisps of smoke on the far side of the street. 'Unfortunately for you, Antonin, Harry is right.'

'My Lord---\'

'Fulminis.' Harry unleashed a violent, white flash of

lightning.

The street lamps burst, scattering small shards of glass across the street, Dolohov scattered into ashes, and a warped, melted silver mask clattered to the tarmac.

Voldemort apparated to it with a soft snap, summoning the smoking mask to hover above his hand. 'I gave these to those who swore themselves to me. I would lead them, give them power, fame, and influence, all they dreamt of, and in return they'd stand beside me until death. After death, even.'

Harry glanced at Sirius, who leant forward, then shook his

head.

*Anti-apparition wards.*

'Antonin betrayed me,' Voldemort whispered. Shivers of

heat washed across the few feet that separated him from Harry. 'I, the greatest wizard who has lived, offered him a chance to stand beside me, and he lied to my face, indulging himself whenever he pleased, harming whoever he wished, ignoring my instructions, my orders, and the loyalty he owed me.' He cast the mask into the burning house of Number Four. 'I *despise* traitors.'

'Have you not seen what you wished to see?\' Harry asked,

gesturing around him.

A glimmer of amusement flickered through Voldemort\'s crimson eyes. 'I did not expect the old fool to die. The younger Malfoy made his choice, succeeded, and faced the fate he chose, but Dumbledore... I said nothing about him. His death was no work of mine.'

'A withering curse,' Harry said, throwing a firm look at Sirius. 'I learnt it where you learnt it.'

'Without Dumbledore, there's nobody with even the slightest chance of stopping me.' Voldemort\'s lips curled into a cold smile. 'I have won, Harry. The Ministry bleeds away in London and I only have to reach out my hand to take Hogwarts. Magical Britain is mine. I will rebuild it. The former colonies it still protects will be the start of my empire and with its power I will do something so great the world never forgets what I accomplished.'

'They'll still hate you.' Harry readied himself to apparate, flexing his fingers on his wand. 'You'll never be great, only terrible.'

'Let them hate me,\' Voldemort hissed. 'It doesn't matter so long as they fear me. To be great is to be powerful, to be powerful is to be feared, and none of them dare to even speak my name anymore.'

'Voldemort.' Harry tore down the wards caging them and

Sirius vanished with a loud crack.

'Avada kedavra.' Voldemort cast a beam of green light through the space Sirius had stood in. 'I will take them all from you eventually. When they're gone, we'll see if you\'re truly my equal.'

Harry drew a rush of white sparks to the tip of his wand. 'I'll

be your *better*.'

Voldemort released a soft, cold laugh and matched Harry's spell. 'Your lies did not and will not deceive me, Harry, and they will not help you deceive yourself. There is no veela girl waiting for you in France. Your smokescreen may have fooled other, lesser wizards and witches, but I knew better and now the girl is dead. I will tear the rest away, too.' Voldemort's crimson eyes gleamed with a cruel, curious light. 'We will see then what power you have that I know not.'

'Fulminis,' Harry hissed.

White lightning arced between them in a blinding flash and he was hurled back across the street, bouncing over the hard stone until he smashed into a hot husk of a van.

Harry rolled onto his knees, leaping to his feet and summoning the Elder Wand back into his hand, ignoring the throb of pain as his grazes crept closed and bruises faded.

'Run, Harry.' Voldemort rose to his feet and called his wand back to his fingers, staring past the burning ruins of the house Harry had never called home. 'Flee from death. I will see you soon enough.'

# Menander's Wisdom

Harry watched Fleur toy with the dragon-shaped chocolate bubble above her drink with a small smile. *Those who run away live to fight another day.*

Sirius sat on the far side of the kitchen table, tugging at his bandages. A crimson blotch spread from his waist to his armpit and his fingertips came away red.

'Looks pretty,' Harry said. 'Maybe you should sit the next few fights out.'

'Don\'t poke it,\' Fleur snapped. 'I\'m not redoing the bandage

again.'

'It\'s soaked through already,\' Sirius grumbled, pulling his

robes closed over the top of it.

'No more duelling if you can avoid it,' Fleur ordered, letting the chocolate dragon collapse back into her drink and taking a long sip. 'And if I see you apparating around the house, I will change the wards so you can't.'

Sirius rolled his eyes. 'It\'s not *that* bad, *Maman.*'

Fleur reached out and poked him in the side without glancing up from her drink.

'Shit,' he hissed, clutching at his ribs.

'Not that bad?' Fleur put down her mug. 'Are you sure?' 'Fine,' Sirius muttered. 'It\'s uncomfortable.' He glowered at

his bandages and glared at Harry. 'How is it you managed to pick the

only girl I've ever met that's more stubborn and determined to be

right than your mother was?'

'A lot of very good luck,' Fleur said. 'Right, mon Amour?' 'There was also some kidnapping of underage boys

involved,' Harry quipped. 'And a lot of threats of immolation.' Fleur stuck her nose in the air. 'Yes. Romance.'

Harry laughed. 'That's not romance. Gabby's taught me all about romance.' He leant in across the table and lowered his voice to a whisper. 'It involves several closely related veela girls and a lot of bodice ripping.'

Fleur shot him a small smile, her summer sky eyes dancing with light. Harry's heart lurched in his breast and his breath stuck in his throat.

'You and Gabby need to spend less time talking about bodice ripping alone together,' Fleur said.

Harry shook his head. 'Nuh uh. We haven't finished planning Gabby's surprise eighteenth birthday present.'

Fleur arched an eyebrow and sipped her hot chocolate.

'How is it going to be a surprise if you're planning it with her?'

'It's a surprise because it's *not* a surprise. She's expecting a

surprise party, so the fact that it's not a surprise is surprising.' 'You're talking nonsense, monCœur.'

He grinned at her. 'I know.'

Fleur glanced at the clock. 'And you only have about fifteen

minutes.'

'Right.' Harry sighed. 'Is the Polyjuice still upstairs?'

'Non.' Fleur plucked two vials from her pocket and slid them across the table. 'Knowing you would leave it to the last minute, I already did it for you.'

He chuckled. 'I resent that entirely fair accusation.' 'Polyjuice?' Sirius squinted at the vials. 'Is this for the closely

related veela girls and bodice ripping?'

Harry laughed and tucked the potions into his pocket. 'Unfortunately not. Nev and I need to pick something up from the bank.'

'The horcrux.' Sirius nodded. 'Watch out for the goblins, Harry. Bill Weasley said they were getting *very* agitated and they don't take kindly to thieves at the best of times.'

'I wasn\'t planning on getting caught.'

'You probably haven't planned anything at all,' Fleur

muttered.

'I had to do some proper planning this time.' Harry stood up. 'It should be fine. Steal some hair. Split them up. Get down to the vault. Get in the vault. Destroy a cup. Get back out again.'

'And be sneaky, because if Voldemort realises we're after his horcruxes, he might make more.' Fleur crossed her ankles under the table and sipped her drink. 'I don't want to have to chase down his trinkets forever.'

'He doesn't know. I lied about Dumbledore's death to cover up our success and he believed me.' Harry watched Sirius's shoulders

relax a little in the corner of his eye. 'And, even better, he thinks Fleur's made up.'

'What? How?!' Fleur narrowed her eyes. 'What did you *say?*' 'Nothing,' he protested. 'He thinks you\'re a story I made up

to... er---' he grimaced '---protect Katie.'

She swept around the table and embraced him. 'Be careful,\' she whispered, curling her fingers into his robes. 'No risks.'

'I\'ll try,' Harry promised.

'If I hear the word improvise even *once* when you come

back,' Fleur murmured. 'I will let Gabby have her way with you.'

'No you won't.' Harry kissed her on the tip of her nose. 'You won't even share your hot chocolate with her.'

'That greedy little harpy just steals it anyway.' Fleur pouted. 'She thinks I don't know.'

'I'm slightly harder to steal,' Harry said.

'You better be,' she whispered, catching his lips in a soft kiss. 'And, as I was saying, any improvisation and I will sizzle you to a crisp.'

'I\'ll keep it a secret,' he said. 'You'll never know.' 'No more secrets, monCœur,' she murmured.

Harry slipped out of her arms. 'I'll be back in a little while,' he promised, apparating into the Chamber of Secrets and glancing at the Marauders' Map.

Nev's name hovered in the Gryffindor common room.

*Not ideal.*

Harry disillusioned himself and strode through the corridors, slipping through the passage behind the Fat Lady after Colin Creevey. Shouting echoed through from the common room.

'You sold him out to McGonagall!' Nev yelled. 'You've no idea if he even had anything to do with it!'

'He *murdered* another student,\' Hermione hissed. 'Who else do you think it was? Professor Trelawney?'

Harry stifled a snort of laughter. *Plot twist.*

'Malfoy was a Death Eater, I was there when they took his body down and the mark was on his forearm.' Nev balled his fists. 'You can get all self-righteous, Hermione, but what have *you* done? Oh, I got Harry Potter expelled. Good work, Hermione. Now what? Nicely ask Voldemort to leave us alone?'

Hermione let out a little scream and yanked at the silver

chain around her neck. 'You don't *understand!*'

Ron caught her hands and eased them free of her necklace. 'Let's go to the library, yeah, Hermione? Cool down a bit. No point fighting among friends, just helps Voldemort.'

Nev turned his back on them.

Harry sidestepped Ron and Hermione; he watched their backs vanish into the passageway and abandoned his concealment. 'Time to go, Nev.'

Nev twisted \'round and gulped. 'Gringotts?'

'Come to Myrtle's bathroom so the wards don't show you leaving.' Harry threw the invisibility cloak over Nev, disillusioned

himself, and strode through the corridors to stand amidst the white tiles. 'We're going to go in and wait, then steal a hair from each of them. Same as we planned before. I go with one, you go with the other. If you get to the vault first, stun the Lestrange brother and the goblin, then leave this mark where I can see it.' He drew the Peverell crest in the air, leaving it to fade behind them.

'Grindelwald's mark...' Nev's face darkened. 'Why?'

'I'll recognise it. Nobody else will have drawn that mark down there'

'But it's *Grindelwald's* mark,' Nev whispered. 'He's *worse*

than Voldemort\...'

'It's just a symbol.' Harry shrugged. 'A message.' 'Like *cadent a latere mortem?*'

'He killed Katie.' Harry fixed him with a flat stare and opened the Chamber of Secrets, pulling Neville over the threshold. 'And we don't have time to talk about it now.' He apparated them into the shadows of the colonnade as the entrance slid closed, leading Nev into the bank.

*Where are they?*

'There,' Nev said, tugging Harry's arm toward a pair of

nondescript, thickset looking wizards on the far side of the hall.

'Sure?' he whispered.

'Oh I\'m sure,' Nev snapped. 'How could I *not* recognise

them?'

'We need to split them up,\' Harry said, drifting a little closer. 'You take Rabastan, I'll take Rodolphus.' He slipped the Elder Wand from his sleeve. 'Imperio.'

Nev tensed.

Rabastan Lestrange shivered as Harry\'s will washed through him; he strode across to stand near them. Harry plucked a hair off his head, passing it and a vial of Polyjuice to Nev.

'Just stick it in and drink it?' Nev asked.

'Quickly,' Harry murmured, catching sight of Rodolphus

pointing to the meeting room off to one side of the desks.

Nev dropped the hair in and shook the potion until it turned a dark yellow, pinching his nose and gulping it down. He groaned and shook as his muscles and bones rippled, his face shifting to match Rabastan's.

Harry checked his appearance, glanced around, then swept the cloak off Nev and over the ImperiusedRabastan. 'Go stand by Rodolphus, don't say anything you don't have to, and leave one of Rodolphus' hairs on the counter.'

Nev's face paled and he balled his fists, but he rose to his feet and strode back across to join Rodolphus. Harry watched him swipe a hair off Rodolphus's collar and place it under the name sign as the goblin led the pair of them away.

*Perfect.* Harry strode over, directing Rabastan after him. He tugged the hair out from under the bronze sign and slipped it into the vial of potion. The thick goop turned a dull orange and Harry gulped it down with a grimace.

Heat bubbled in his bones and his muscles writhed beneath his skin. His bones twisted and shifted, his skin stretching and shrinking like elastic. Harry held his breath until it faded, abandoning his disillusionment, pulling the cloak off Rabastan, and stepping across in front of another goblin teller as they came out to the desk.

*Let\'s go visit the vault*.

'I would like to visit my vault,' Rabastan demanded,

extending his wand to the goblin.

The goblin turned it over in his long-fingered hands, then nodded and passed it back. 'Follow me.' It led them down a rough, torchlit passage and into one of Gringotts's rather small carts.

They plunged on thin, iron tracks down into the bowels of the bank, twisting 'round sharp corners and winding between vast stalagmites and stalactites.

'Not too much further,' the goblin said.

*This is a long way down.* Harry grimaced. *Getting out won't*

*be fun if we get caught.*

A fine, thin cool washed over his face. Rabastan shook his head and froze.

*The waterfall.* Harry slipped his wand from his sleeve, but his body shivered, shuddered and squirmed as he took hold of it.

'Intruder.' The goblin clutched for the brake.

'Imperio,' Harry ordered, forcing his wand arm up at the

goblin.

'Potter!' Rabastan's knuckles grazed his shoulder as the cart

lurched left.

The Elder Wand bounced away into the bottom of the cart.

Harry ducked a second swing, hammering his fist into Rabastan's stomach and driving his knee into his face as Lestrange doubled over. Rabastan smashed his head into Harry's face and white-hot pain flared through his nose.

'Not so tough.' Rabasran sneered, smearing blood off his lips with the back of his hand. 'You\'ve evaded the Dark Lord long enough.'

Harry threw himself forward, knocking Rabastan back and over the seats, and snatching the Elder Wand from the floor. The cart skidded to a halt, tossing them both forward against the cart's side.

'The Lestrange vault is just through here,' the goblin said, pointing down past the pink-scarred, dirt-encrusted, white-scaled hide of a large dragon.

'No,' Rabastan hissed, dragging himself up on the side of the cart. 'You have come for our Lord\'s treasure, but you will *not* have it!'

Harry jumped out and back-stepped after the goblin, deflecting curses into the stalagmites. Rastaban swore, hurling glimmering yellow blood-boiling curses down the slope. Harry batted them away and sent a volley of piercing hexes back, smashing the cart off the rails and down into the dark. Rabastan jumped over the edge and slid down to the dragon terrace, dodging the creature's swipe, and firing curses at the goblin.

*Merde.* Harry slid down after him, unleashing a hail of bone- splintering curses. *If he kills the goblin, we can't get into the vault.*

Rabastan snarled and threw up his shield as Harry sprinted down the path. The goblin thrust a key into the lock.

'No!' Rabastan abandoned his shield, grunting as a pair of

bone-splintering curses struck his left arm. 'Avada kedavra!'

Green light flashed off the stalagmites and the goblin crumpled.

Rabastan swivelled 'round and raised his wand before his face. 'You won\'t take another step toward my vault, Potter.'

Harry turned his magic on the goblin, threading his will through it until its eyes snapped open and it lurched to its feet.

Rabastan tracked Harry's gaze, glancing behind him. 'Fuck!'

The goblin hurled itself onto him, biting and clawing.

Harry dashed past the wrestling pair and stared at a mountain of gold, gems and priceless things. *Merde. I'll never find it in here.* He took a deep breath. *But I don't have to find it, I just need to know it's in here.*

'You\'re too late, Lestrange,' he shouted. 'The cup is destroyed.'

Rabastan hurled the severed head of the goblin at Harry's feet, swiping blood out of his eyes. 'Then I will die for breaking my promise.' He raised his wand. 'But you will be dead before I pay for my failure, Potter. That, I guarantee.'

*It's here. Now I just have to tear it away from Voldemort.*

Harry drew the on the cold spark of hate at his heart and unleashed a billow of Fiendfyre, sending red tongues of flame swirling 'round him. *Ashes to ashes.*

The Fiendfyre coalesced into the bright, white-hot basilisk.

me.'

'I am not afraid of fire,' Rabastan spat. 'You won\'t intimidate

Harry sent the basilisk lunging through the open door and

released his control. Rabastan howled in fury and hurled blood- boiling curses at Harry who swatted them away, returning fire.

Bright orange curses scorched black marks into pale stalagmites and spattered in sharp hisses across the cold, damp stone. Harry's purple curses punched smoking holes through Rabastan's robes and he dropped to his knees, spluttering blood across the ground. Summoning a whip of bright fire, Harry took both of Lestrange\'s arms off at the elbow.

'What now, Potter?' Rabastan rasped, staring at the smoking stumps of his arms. 'The Dark Lord cannot be defeated. All of this will be for nothing. He took the girl away from you, he'll take everything else, too.'

'No, he won't.' Harry kicked Rabastan into the fire within the

vault and dragged the door closed. 'I won't be nothing.'

He tossed the keys away into the dark. *Now to find Nev.*

A cart rumbled to a stop above him on the slope. 'You\'ve got guts little Longbottom.' Rodolphus's deep voice thrummed with laughter. 'You take after your parents in that. They were strong wizards, brave wizards, but not *cunning*, and I daresay you aren\'t either.'

*Merde.* Harry disillusioned himself and clambered up the rocks to the summit.

'He is a thief in Gringotts, wizard,' the goblin snarled. 'He is

ours.'

'I caught him,' Rodolphus snapped. 'He's mine.\'

'The bank is aware of the intruder,' the goblin growled. 'Soon my kin and the guards will be here; it would be best if you gave us our prisoner.'

*Double Merde.*

'Was that a *threat*, goblin?' Rodolphus hissed.

'Gringotts is goblin land and under goblin law. The treaties are clear, break their terms at your own peril.'

'Fine,' Rodolphus spat. 'But *only* after he tells me why he came. I owe the little bastard for my hand and for whatever he did to my brother!\'

'He must be alive and coherent,' the goblin hissed.

Harry rounded the stalagmite, glimpsing a tangled mass of

flesh where Rodolphus's left fingers ought to have been.

'Crucio.' Rodolphus sneered as Neville writhed and howled beneath his wand. 'Where is my brother? If he is dead or harmed, I will torture you until your whole family has a ward in St Mungo\'s.'

Harry dropped his disillusionment and banished Rodolphus down the slope, summoning Nev's wand from the ground.

'Harry!' Nev gasped. 'I\'m sorry. I was caught. They\'re coming

now.'

'I imagine---' Harry handed Nev his wand back '---it'll be

quite easy to take your revenge now.'

Nev levelled his wand at Rodolphus with a trembling hand.

'You know the words,' Harry whispered. 'Do it for yourself. Think of everything he stole, think how much you hated him, how much you hated *everything.* Use it. You know the words.'

Nev's wand tip dropped. 'I can\'t. I just can\'t.'

*Perhaps you aren\'t like me after all.*

'Reducto,' Harry murmured, knocking Rodolphus back along

the ground and leaving a thin trail of blood.

'Some terrifying wizard you are, Potter!\' Rodolphus laughed. 'If you hadn't ambushed me, I'd've torn you apart.'

The dragon stirred behind him, snaking its neck up over his head. Nev covered his eyes as its jaws crunched closed over Rodolphus.

'You fed him to a dragon,' Nev whispered. 'He was just lying there and you...'

'Did what you couldn't,' Harry said. 'Just like I *always* have to. When you all get too afraid to do what has to be done, who has to come save you? *I do.*' He turned to the goblin. 'You've five seconds to tell me how I can get out or that dragon's going to get a second snack.'

The goblin cackled. 'This is *Gringotts.* Nobody steals from Gringotts and survives.'

'Watch me,' Harry declared, raising his wand. 'Well, I say watch me, but you've wasted your five seconds, so...'

Wait!' The goblin raised its hands. 'There's a way. There are tunnels back up from every level, but they're warded, only goblins

can pass through the archways, so you'll need me to get you up there.'

'Where does the tunnel lead?' Harry demanded.

'Up. All the way up to the top.' The goblin pointed at the alcove behind the dragon. 'It's just a lot of steps.'

*Of course it had to be behind the dragon. Why are there always dragons?* Harry pulled the invisibility cloak out from under his robes. *Still, at least with this, we can just walk out.*

Nev released a long sigh and his shoulders sagged. 'Thank you. Do you have a name?'

The goblin stared. 'Griphook...'

\'Nice name. Goodbye, Griphook.' Harry imbued his magic into the air and closed it around the goblin like a giant fist, crushing Griphook into a wide smear of red upon the stone. 'Come on, Nev.'

Nev ripped his arm away. 'He was *innocent*, Harry.' 'Innocent is a strong word. He would've betrayed us the

moment he had the chance.'

'We could have stunned him! Memory charmed him!' 'And risk it going wrong or being undone? The goblins

would be after us for the rest of our lives.' Harry swept the cloak over them both. 'I promised Fleur not to take risks.' He dragged Nev after him past the dragon into a rough-hewn passage, stifling the trickle of ice in his blood. 'I don't break my promises to Fleur.'

'It's someone's *life*,' Nev hissed. 'A little bit of risk is nothing.'

'A little bit of risk is a little bit too much,' Harry retorted. 'You don't risk losing things that are that important. Do you have any idea what it would be like to live without them?!'

*What do you know of perfect dreams?* Harry smothered a flash of cold fury. *Of how cold and dark and empty the world is when there are no dreams left?*

'You risked your life before!' Nev cried.

'Because I thought it was what I was *meant* to do,' Harry snapped. 'And if I wasn't a hero to all of you, then I wasn't anything at all. But I know better now. I don't need to be a hero. I just need Fleur.'

'You think Fleur would want you to do this? Or Katie?' Nev demanded. 'What would they say if they saw what you just did?'

'They've seen me do worse.' Nev froze. 'They *what?*'

'Fleur and Katie understood.' Harry hauled Nev after him by the arm, biting back on the ball of cold closing 'round his heart. 'There's no good or evil here. There's no dark or light. There's just a mad scramble of selfish little people for all their different dreams.

You can give up and let them use you, or you can make your own

wishes come true.'

'That's not true,' Nev whispered. 'It's *not*.'

Harry dragged him over the last few steps and out of the main bank into the shadows of the colonnade. 'Are you going to tell me you only wanted me to teach you so you could help others?' He apparated them back to the edge of the quidditch pitch and dropped

Nev into the dirt. 'Or will you admit it was because you wanted to be

better, for yourself?'

'That's not the same!'

'Yes it is. You wanted something. You made sure it happened. I also want something and I'm making sure it happens. The only difference is that the stakes are higher for me!'

'Well, then I'm just not as strong as you,' Nev muttered. 'I can't do that to someone. I just... *can't.*'

'Then one day, when you find yourself opposite someone who can, they'll tear your dream away from you.' Harry slipped his wand back into his sleeve. 'And I bet you'll wish you'd been stronger when they do.'

Nev staggered to his feet. 'Maybe if everyone wants to tear your dream away, it's the *dream* that\'s the problem!'

'I don't want to rule the world, I just want to be free to spend my life with Fleur.' Harry thrust a finger at the ruined grass where Katie had died. 'It's all of you that keep trying to take things away. You all made it this way, not me.'

*You can't understand, can you?* He stared at Neville's pale,

horrified face. *You're not like me.*

Harry apparated back into the kitchen with a soft snap.

Silver hair, warm arms, and the scent of marzipan enveloped him. The weight vanished from his shoulders and his heart lifted, the ice melting away to a soft, warm glow.

'What happened?' Fleur demanded. He chuckled. 'I improvised.'

She stamped on his foot and pain flashed up his leg. 'You do not come back with a face like that and joke!'

*My face?* His fingers crept up to the soft throbbing and came away smeared red. *My nose.*

'Nothing serious.' Harry held her close. 'I destroyed the cup.

Neville... He doesn't understand.' He sighed and breathed in the smell of her marzipan perfume. 'I think I lost a friend today. My last friend.'

She cupped his cheek with her hand. 'I'm sorry, mon Amour, but that's what happens. They're just not like us. They can't understand.' Fleur pressed her lips to his jaw and rested her head on his shoulder. 'Forget them. We have our perfect wish. That's all we need.'

'The trouble with sunsets is they don't last forever,' he

murmured.

Fleur stiffened in his arms. 'Mon Cœur?' she whispered. 'We're not free until there's nothing that can steal you from

me,' Harry murmured. 'So long as there's a way I can lose you, our dream's not safe.'

'Then we make sure it's safe,' she said. 'However we have

to.'

# Distinguished Alumnus

Raindrops drummed against the window, swirling in the gloom beyond the glass.

'What is wrong with the weather in this country?' Fleur muttered, rummaging through the kitchen cupboards. 'Incroyable.'

'Raining again, is it?\' Harry asked.

'You know it is.' Fleur scowled. 'You can hear it.' 'Stay inside then.' Harry grinned. 'Nothing good ever

happens in the rain.'

She sighed. 'I wanted to go out into the meadows today. It\'s

the middle of spring, Harry, there should be some *sun*.'

'There is, it\'s just behind all those grey clouds.' Harry waved a hand at the window. 'Don't worry, we usually see it sometime around July... For about two days.'

'You\'re so *British*.' Fleur wrinkled her nose. 'You're lucky I am slowly civilising you.'

'Or maybe you just think you are and I'm actually *de*-

civilising you.'

She threw everything back into the cupboard and kicked it

shut. 'Why is it raining all the time?!'

Harry glanced up. Fleur glowered at the cupboard, her arms folded across her chest and a delicate pout on her pale, rose-pink lips.

'We\'re out of sugar, aren\'t we?'

'I bought a *whole bag* last week,' she cried. 'Sirius is stealing

it because I stopped him apparating around. I *know* he is.'

'I\'m not Sirius.' Harry slipped out of his chair and stepped across the kitchen, pressing kisses to her pout until it curved into a smile and her hands slid into his hair. He pulled her mouth against his and summoned the jar of sugar Sirius had stashed behind the sofa into his hand. 'Here you go.'

Fleur leant back from his lips. 'You kept it a secret long enough to steal your kisses,\' she murmured.

'Would you have it any other way?' he teased.

'Well.' Her lips trailed over the corner of his mouth and along his jaw. 'I can think of a much more *appropriate* reward for returning my stolen treasure.'

'Let's not give Sirius a show.' Harry tucked the jar into her hands. 'I heard him creaking about upstairs a few minutes ago.'

'Fine.' Fleur tugged the lid off the jar and snatched up her spoon. 'But later, you're going to make it up to me. A lot.'

Harry stepped behind her and wrapped his arms round her waist as she dipped the tablespoon into the jar. 'One for the hot chocolate---' he watched her pour a heaped spoonful of sugar into the steaming mug '---and one for me.'

Fleur stole the next spoonful for herself and shrugged,

flashing him a bright smile. 'It's meant to be eaten.'

The wards thrummed.

Harry slipped the Elder Wand from his sleeve. 'I'll take a look.' He apparated up to the window on the stairs and peered out into the rain.

Wet grass and branches rustled and swayed in the breeze around the front path.

He apparated back. 'Nothing I can see from inside.'

Fleur set her mug of hot chocolate down and pulled out her wand, closing her eyes. 'The wards are still fine. Something just touched them.'

'I\'ll go out,' Harry said, disillusioning himself and apparating

into the rain.

Cool wet drops struck his skin as he picked his way along the path, skirting the puddles. A silver wolf prowled the edge of the ward.

'Harry,' Neville\'s voice emanated from it. 'He\'s here, Harry.

They\'re all here. We *need* you.'

*And suddenly they want a hero again.* Harry apparated back into the kitchen and tried to smother the churning in his stomach.

*Voldemort and the snake will be there, at least.*

'He's attacking Hogwarts,' he said.

'We\'re going.' Fleur nodded. 'I'll get Sirius.' 'Expectopatronum,' Harry murmured, sending the silver

anzu back. 'I'm coming.'

*I need to kill the snake at the very least.*

'I heard we\'re going back to school.' Sirius rubbed sleep from his eyes, yawning at the kitchen door. 'It's under attack?'

'You look terrible,' Harry said, tucking the Elder Wand into

his left sleeve. 'Perhaps you should stay here.'

'I\'m not staying behind. Not when I can still cast spells or seduce enemy witches.'

Fleur appeared behind him. 'Looking like that?'

'Why did you and James have to choose such cruel women?'

Sirius whined.

'Are you ready?' Fleur's knuckles turned white around her

wand.

'As ready as I'll ever be.' Harry\'s heart hammered against his

ribs. 'Snake first. Voldemort second.'

He held out his hand. Sirius grabbed his wrist and Fleur's slim fingers slid through his. He apparated them into the chamber beside the pool.

Sirius hissed and pressed his fingers to his chest. 'Bloody

hell.'

'You go up and look for the snake.' Fleur pulled her wand

out and ran its tip over Sirius's chest. 'I'll fix him up so he can fight a

little bit.'

Harry pulled her close and kissed her hard. 'If he\'s too hurt to duel well, make sure he stays down here however you have to,' he whispered in her ear.

'We'll need every spell, mon Amour,' Fleur whispered. 'Go.

And be *careful*.'

Harry bounded up the stairs three at a time, opening the

entrance with a flick of his wand. 'Neville?'

A flash of blue light smashed into his ribs, knocking him back against the wall. Thick, dark ropes swirled from the air and coiled around his right arm, lashing him to the taps.

'I knew you'd come back.' Hermione stepped out from behind a cubicle door and levelled her wand at him. A fierce gleam hovered in her eyes above the dark bags. 'I *knew* it.'

'So you decided to tie me up?' Harry tested the ropes, but they held firm. 'I'm flattered, Hermione, but this *really* isn't the best time. Let me go.'

He tried to get his wand out of his sleeve, but the ropes trapped the holster under his sleeve. *Merde.* Harry twisted his left arm \'round until the Elder Wand slid down against his palm. *Left- handed it is.*

'Neville was stupid enough to call you back here.' Hermione pointed her free hand out into the corridor at a pair of still feet. 'I saw your patronus and followed him so I could stop you!'

Harry blinked. 'Stop me stopping Voldemort?'

'No,' she hissed. 'Stop you from falling any further, before

we have *two* Voldemorts.'

Cold panic clamped around his throat, driving the breath from his lungs. *She means to kill me.* He wrenched at the ropes, but they held his arm fast. *I refuse to die. I won't go back to the emptiness. I'm staying with Fleur.*

'You've no idea what you're talking about,' he retorted, tucking his left hand behind his back. 'Get rid of these ropes and let me stop Voldemort! Nobody else can!'

'You're a *murderer*,' Hermione whispered. 'You killed Malfoy.

You hung his body in the Great Hall...' 'He killed Katie.'

'*You* killed Katie!' Her wand glimmered with purple light and his left arm snapped up against the wall. Dark ropes wrapped 'round it, pinning the Elder Wand against his forearm. 'Malfoy was in the library. It was *you!* And you probably killed Viktor and who knows how many other people!'

A little ball of cold settled in Harry's heart. 'You're an idiot.

Katie was my best friend.'

'I don\'t believe you,' Hermione murmured. 'I miss the boy who dragged us all into danger to save anyone and everyone he could.' She squeezed her eyes closed and pointed her wand at his head. 'But you're not him. And you're too dangerous to be left alive.'

*I'm sorry, Fleur.* He strained every sinew against the ropes without success, ignoring the cold despair rising up around his heart. *I'm sorry.*

Footsteps echoed up the stairs.

Hermione whirled around and slashed her wand at the

passage. 'Sectumsempra!'

Her spell carved a jagged line a finger\'s length deep through the tiles and plaster, and into the chest of the figure in the entrance. Silver flickered in the shadows beyond the swirling white dust and Harry's heart stopped.

*Fleur.*

Panic clenched its fist about him and his blood pounded in his ears. Black mist exploded from his right sleeve, tearing the ropes away.

'That\'s Snivellus\'s spell.' Sirius stumbled from the dark, touching a finger to the blood pouring down his chest. 'James is never going to let me hear the end of this.'

He crumpled onto his face.

Fleur stood behind him, wand outstretched, feathers sprouting from her skin and her eyes burning black.

'You\'re really with him,' Hermione whispered. 'But---\' 'You treacherous, selfish, shallow little girl,' Fleur hissed,

raising her wand. 'I'm going to melt your face off for taking Sirius from

Harry.'

Hermione reeled back. 'You're just as bad as Harry, aren't

you!? *You're* why he killed Katie!'

Harry slipped his ebony wand from his sleeve and cut away the other ropes as Fleur threw up a shimmering ward.

\'Sectumsempra,\' Hermione cried, slashing her wand over and over.

Jagged purple lines of magic hung against the shimmer and

a stream of white flames seared a hole through Hermione's chest. She flopped onto the tiles with a low thud and a quiet clink. Fleur stepped aside and dropped her ward, letting Hermione's spell score deep lines into the wall. Harry tucked his ebony wand away and

drew the Elder Wand, stepping over to Hermione and turning her over with his foot.

A heart-shaped, silver locket bearing a serpentine *S* swung in the smoking hole in her ribs, gleaming brightly as it dangled above her charred flesh.

Horror coiled in his gut and prickled down his spine. *I destroyed that. I burnt it in the cave.* He took a deep breath, grimacing at the stink of seared meat. *But I didn't check that locket before I burnt it. It must've been a decoy.*

Fleur stepped past him and jabbed her wand at Neville.

'Rennervate.'

'Hermione!' He scrambled to his feet, snatching his wand from his robes, then caught sight of them and released a long sigh. 'Oh, Harry... Sorry, she got me by surprise.'

'She killed my godfather.' A wave of revulsion surged up within him. 'Get out of my sight, Neville.'

'You killed her,' Neville muttered. 'You killed *Hermione.*'

'I killed what was left of her.' Harry thrust his wand at the corridor. 'Now go away.'

\'Wait!' Neville edged into the room past Fleur and crouched down, brushing Hermione's hair aside. 'I should give this to Ron.' His fingers brushed the clasp to the locket's chain and he flinched back, staggering away against the wall.

'What\'s wrong?' Harry flexed his fingers on the Elder Wand and shifted his weight onto the balls of his feet.

'I saw you,' Neville whispered. 'You were *terrible*.'

'It's cursed. It showed Hermione the same thing; it *drove* her to this. All her nightmares\...' He wrapped a handful of paper towels around his hand and ripped the locket from Hermione's neck. 'I'll destroy it.'

'Get out, Neville,' Fleur hissed. 'You're no friend of Harry's.'

Neville flinched and stumbled away down the corridor.

Harry balanced the silver heart upon his palm. 'Open,' he

murmured in parseltongue.

The world fell away.

A charred withered willow trunk smoked over fouled, dark water and red-spattered pebbles, burnt branches clawing out at a crimson sunset. Harry's gaze slid down to a blood-smeared lock of silver hair fluttering in his palm and his lips twisted into a bitter smile.

*Never.* He tore himself free and hurled the locket to the floor, burying it in a gout of Fiendfyre. *That will never happen.*

The locket screamed, blackened and cracked, melting into a pool of silver, dark mist scattering from it like smoke before the breeze.

Amour?'

'What did you see?' Fleur put a hand on his shoulder. 'Mon

'Something that will never happen.'

Harry stared down at Hermione's pale face with a soft,

hollow pang. *Goodbye, Hermione.*

'The snake,' Fleur murmured, raising the Resurrection Stone up on the slim silver chain hanging \'round her neck. 'You can say goodbye later\...'

'The snake.' Harry took a deep breath. 'These are just husks now. There's no point talking to something that's lost its soul.'

*The snake will be with Voldemort.* He strode out of the bathroom. *Or somewhere nearby, like it was at Azkaban.*

Screams and shouts rang through the corridors, the tang of acrid smoke stung his nose and the flash and thunder of spell-fire echoed from across the school.

'Let's start at the Great Hall,' he said, hurrying toward the stairs. 'Keep an eye out for the snake. Homenumrevelio will show it, since it's a living horcrux.'

Fleur murmured the words of the spell glancing all around,

then froze and grabbed his shoulder. 'Above us, on the stairs. Someone's with it. They're coming this way.'

'Voldemort, probably.' Harry forced a twist of panic down

and started up the steps. 'You need to go.'

'No time for that.' Fleur shot him a trembling smile. 'At least we don't have to go out into the rain.'

Ron burst around the corner, wild-eyed, gripping his wand

like a dagger. 'Did you see that bloody snake?'

Relief flooded through him. 'We were just looking for it, it's around here somewhere.'

'Merde,' Fleur murmured. 'I can't see it anymore.'

A dark shape reared in the corner of Harry's eye, lunging

forward, fangs agape.

*Merde.* Harry braced himself for pain.

Fleur gasped, grasping at her heel.

*'No*,' Harry whispered.

The snake struck again, burying its fangs in Fleur's shoulder. A bright green flash rippled down the corridor and the snake flopped away, rolling down the stairs.

'It's deadly,' Ron muttered, backing away down the corridor.

'That's what killed Dad. The venom.'

'You can't die.' Harry cradled Fleur against him, brushing her hair back from her face. 'You're going to be fine,' he murmured. 'You're going to be fine. You *have* to be fine.'

Fleur's breathing grew shallow and fast and her eyelids slipped shut. The world spun around him, dark spots hovering before his eyes and his heartbeat hammering in his ears as he gasped for breath.

hell.

*Our dream.* A twist of fury rose, bright as dawn but hot as

Black mist swirled \'round his arm, stripping the sleeve from

his robes, scattering tatters of cloth across the floor, and scoring deep gouges into the stone floor.

'It broke my wand.' Fleur opened her eyes and held up two

pieces of rosewood joined by a glowing, silver thread.

Harry pressed his ebony wand into her hand. 'Have mine. Just don't leave.' He clutched her against him and buried his face in her hair. 'You can't leave me. Please don't leave me.'

She let out a soft groan. 'You're crushing my ribs, monCœur.'

Fleur kissed his forehead. 'But apart from that, I'm going to be fine. We did a ritual, remember?'

*The ritual.* Relief flooded through him. *Of course.*

'Sorry.' He loosened his grip as his heartbeat slowed. 'I panicked.'

'I know.' Fleur held his gaze with a soft little gleam in her blue eyes, tucking the broken pieces of her wand away and holding his up. 'Reducto.'

The bannisters shattered and Sir Cadogan's portrait

exploded into splinters.

'This will work,' she said. 'There's only one thing left now, mon Amour.'

*Just Voldemort.* Harry helped Fleur to her feet and descended toward the Great Hall. *No big deal. Just the most feared wizard alive.*

A cluster of white-masked Death Eaters sprinted toward them, hurling bright curses. They burst against Fleur's shield like distant fireworks.

'Fulminis,' Harry murmured.

A white flash tore through the corridor. He blinked away the green spots, throwing up his shield until the corridor came back into focus.

Ashes floated to the ground around them.

'Potter!'

Harry twisted 'round and deflected away a barrage of red spells and orange hexes. Fleur danced through bright beams of magic, twirling between two white-masked Death Eaters, spinning them in circles until their spells hit each other and they dropped to the floor.

'Potter!' Lucius Malfoy's voice echoed from behind the half- melted silver mask shining at the bottom of the staircase. 'I'm going to strangle you with your own entrails for what you did to my son!'

A wave of scorpions sprang from the debris, scuttling up the stairs, and Malfoy hurled spells at him, ripping holes through portraits and scorching tapestries.

Harry thrust his magic into the air, crushing the scorpions into a paste of twitching legs and tails. 'You made a promise to Voldemort. I'm going to tear you away from him. He's not going to have a *single* loyal follower left.'

Malfoy snarled and sprinted up the steps, curses streaking from his wand in crackling beams of orange and yellow.

Harry swatted them away. *Just a couple steps further.*

Malfoy's foot sunk into the trick step and he jerked to a halt,

his wand slipping from his grasp and bouncing down the stairs.

Harry wrapped the air around his arms and ripped them off with a twist of his wand, spraying red across the steps. 'Always one *step* behind.' He kicked Malfoy down into the rubble with a small smile.

Fleur stepped over Malfoy's shuddering body and exchanged spells with a trio of Death Eaters, catching their curses upon her small Unyielding Shield Charm and hurling white fire over the nearest two.

*Where's Voldemort?* Harry wondered, waiting for an opening as the two Death Eaters flailed and burnt. *Watching from somewhere? He must be watching.*

The final of the three dived past Fleur and tore the white mask from her face. 'You killed my son,' Narcissa Malfoy hissed. She hurled the ivory at his feet with a snarl, shattering it across the floor.

'I killed your husband, too.' Harry banished the pieces of the mask back at her and wrapped the air about her throat as she flinched.

Narcissa let out a hoarse scream. 'Avada kedavra!'

Harry ducked the flash of green and snapped her neck with a flick of his wand. Narcissa Malfoy's grey eyes turned blank and she crumpled to the floor.

'Is he outside?' Fleur asked, picking her way back across the

corridor.

'I think so. It's the best place for a final duel.' Harry held out

the cloak to her, but she darted past it and threw her arms around him. 'He's waiting for me. You can't come. I won't be able to fight if you're there. I won't be able to *breathe* if you're there.'

*He thinks you're a lie I made up to protect Katie.* Harry hardened his heart. *So if this does go wrong, if it's our dream that dies, you'll still be safe.*

Fleur clung to him and buried her face in his chest. 'Make sure you win.' She crushed her lips against his. 'You have to win, mon Amour. You *must*.'

*As long as you live.* He pried himself out of her arms and draped his invisibility cloak over her shoulders, spinning the Elder

Wand 'round in his hand in a swirl of silver sparks. *There's no difference between being alone and being dead, not if you're not here.*

'I won't lose.' Harry stepped through the doors. 'I refuse to lose,' he whispered.

Corpses sprawled across the courtyard. Cold rain pattered upon their cold, pale limbs and faces, soaking into Harry's robes.

'Harry. *At last.*' Voldemort spread his arms at the courtyard's centre, shimmering with magic like a flame veiled in heat haze. 'Come. Let's see what power you have that I know not.'

# Happy Endings...

Red eyes glowed hot as coals above a cold grin.

Voldemort's dark robes steamed as he stood over tattered bodies

and blood-drenched stones.

'My power is supposed to be love, according to Dumbledore,' Harry said, stifling the churning anxiety in his stomach. 'I'm going to throw amortentia at you and run away.'

Voldemort's crimson eyes narrowed. 'There is no such thing as love. It is a child's desperate wish. Dandelion seeds sailing into the sea on a cold wind.' He raised his wand and cut the right sleeve from his robes, letting the scrap of black fabric float away into the dead. 'If love is your weapon, your death is certain.' The cold grin returned. 'But you do not *have* love, do you, Harry? The girl is dead. Your dreams are spent. All that is left is *power.*'

Harry flexed his fingers on the Elder Wand. 'You are

nothing.'

A flinch spasmed across Voldemort's face. 'I am the greatest

wizard that has ever lived! I've mastered magic other wizards cannot

begin to comprehend, let alone cast!'

'You're nothing. Nobody.' Harry took a step further forward into the rain. 'Tom is forgotten, less than a memory. I am *the Dark Lord's* equal, not Tom's.'

Voldemort's face twisted into a glare. 'Tom. Voldemort. They are just names. Means to an end. *I* am here. *I* am *great.*' He thrust his wand at the corpses, bathing them in an eerie yellow aura of magic. 'It doesn't matter what title they whisper their pleas and

curses to. It doesn't matter what names they call me. I won't be

forgotten. I will exist *forever*.'

The bodies rose, jerking and spasming onto their hands and feet. Nails, hair and teeth elongated, skin swelled up, cracking and hardening, dead faces twisting into snarls.

'If I kill you here, you won't return,' Harry said. 'I can guarantee that.'

'My horcruxes.' Raw fury blazed in Voldemort's scarlet irises and he swept his wand forward. 'I will tear you limb from limb, Harry. Your death will be the moment in which I restore my immortality.

Your defeat will be total and my victory, *final*.'

Harry allowed himself a small smile and a moment of quiet

satisfaction. 'Not if I kill you.'

The inferi hurled themselves forward. Ron's wild red mane trailed behind him as his defiled corpse lunged ahead of the pack. Harry bathed the horde in Fiendfyre, turning the first couple to ash. Voldemort's magic washed into the crimson flames and they exploded beyond control.

*Merde.* Harry abandoned the Fiendfyre and forced his magic into the air, sweeping the inferi back against the walls.

Voldemort squashed the flames and unleashed a storm of spells. Harry deflected them away, releasing a stream of butterflies from the tip of the Elder Wand. They swarmed upon the inferi in a cloud of dark wings, turning them to dust.

'Lacero.' Harry slipped other curses into his assault between wand motions, burying Voldemort in a hail of hexes.

Voldemort batted the first three curses aside and apparated across the courtyard. Harry's spells scored long, dark scorch marks into the stones as he twisted around, continuing his attack.

Voldemort hurled his own spells back. They exploded in the middle of the yard, crackling beams melting sizzling holes through the stone cloisters and sparks showering down onto the thin veil of dark dust beneath their feet. The tree in the corner withered and burst into flames.

Harry transfigured the stone behind Voldemort into serpents and sent them lunging forward into the shivering aura of Voldemort's magic. They melted into smoking, bubbling orange pools a metre from his back.

\'Contusio.' Voldemort flicked a string of silver beads of light

from the tip of his wand.

Harry threw up a shield, wincing as the silver sparks burst against it in a bright flash and deafening clap. Bright red spells punched through the bright wall of magic.

*Merde.* He apparated up to the roof, stripping the tiles from it and hurling them down at Voldemort in a wave of lichen-patched stone.

flash.

'Fulminis.' Voldemort obliterated the tiles in a brilliant white

Harry apparated back down into the courtyard as the roof

exploded behind him. Voldemort whipped the crackling beam of

lightning back 'round, slicing through stonework like butter. 'Fulminis,' Harry cried, unleashing his own.

White light seared at his eyes. Harry threw up his shield and blinked the green spots from his vision as washes of colour burst

across the wall of pale light protecting him. A flash of green hissed over his head.

He apparated across the courtyard and gulped in a few deep breaths.

Cracked, charred columns lay strewn across the flagstones amongst a mound of shattered tiles and dust. Molten stone steamed and smoked beneath where their spells had clashed.

'See, Harry.' Voldemort raised his wand, veiled in a shivering cloak of haze so hot the stones beneath his feet glowed and wept. 'You are outmatched.'

He shoved a stab of fear down. *No. It doesn't matter how powerful he is.* Harry flicked the Elder Wand and closed the air around Voldemort, smothering the shimmering aura to a faint flicker. *I mustn't lose.*

Voldemort's veil of magic tore free and a serpent\'s maw lunged from the lava at the courtyard\'s centre, thrusting its fangs at Harry. He transfigured the stone beneath into towering spikes puncturing the creature\'s skin and splashing molten rock across the courtyard.

Voldemort's soft laughter drifted over the hissing and sizzle of the lava. 'See how strong I have made you? Everything I took, everything you sacrificed, it's made you more powerful than any save myself.' He twirled his yew wand in his fingers, showering the ground in silver sparks. 'Be proud, Harry. There is no other wizard or witch who can almost call themselves my equal.'

*Almost.* A tight, bright point of cold welled within him. *I*

*didn't lose Katie, Sirius, and so much more for almost.*

Raindrops froze, falling to shatter on stones surrounding him. Hoarfrost crept in spirals from his feet and his breath misted in the air.

Voldemort's crimson eyes narrowed. 'You have surpassed spells, too.' He thrust his wand out. 'So be it.'

*Die.* Harry levelled the Elder Wand at him and forced every drop of power he could drag up through it. *I need to be free.*

Two waves of magic crashed together at the courtyard's centre in a flickering, howling storm. Freezing and searing winds buffeted Harry, steam billowed into the sky, and sparks fountained across fractured stones. The flagstones beneath crumbled away to dust and stray arcs of magic flashed from the whirling cloud of magic like lightning, shattering columns and walls.

A dull, low throb settled in Harry's limbs, biting deeper with every second. He clung on and clenched his jaw.

Voldemort bared his teeth and took a step forward, sweat trickling down the side of his pale skull. The ache sank its teeth further into Harry as he forced himself to take a pace toward the storm. Voldemort staggered a step closer, then another, clutching his bare wand arm with his free hand. Blood trickled from beneath his nails and dripped from his forearm.

The storm churned, bulging and bubbling, flickering with bright light. Beams of magic lanced from its whirl, scorching deep, glowing marks across the ground.

Harry dragged his right foot forward a step, but his left leg turned to lead and refused to move. The maelstrom burst, tossing him back into the wall like a rag doll. Pain exploded through him as he hauled himself up on the wall, his ribs grating with each gasp and a slick, hot tang of copper coating his tongue.

*I can't lose.* He swiped sweat from his eyes and slashed his wand forward.

The hazy basilisk tore through Voldemort's shield and smashed him against the gatehouse. He spluttered blood onto the stones, smearing red from his mouth on the back of his arm and stood.

A shimmer of magic fell over the castle.

'The Ministry,' Voldemort said, glancing up at the sky. 'Come

to desperately throw what little they have left at me.'

'You're outnumbered.' Harry forced his wand up. 'Trapped.' 'We are both trapped.' Voldemort's bloodstained lips curled

into a cold grin and he raised his yew wand, drawing a ribbon of

silver light from its tip. 'But you are spent.'

The silver ribbon snapped forward.

Harry clawed up what he could from the last dregs of his

magic. 'Fulminis,' he gasped.

The bright white flash met the silver ribbon in a thunderclap in the air above them, shattering the Owlery tower behind him and the bridge beyond Voldemort. Stone crashed down around them, spilling into a great mound of rubble, and owls burst across the skies above the swirling dust.

Voldemort clambered up onto the heap, sweeping back the dust with a flick of his wand. 'Ever you surpass my expectations, Harry.' A strange gleam of hunger hovered in his scarlet irises. 'If only I could let you live, watch you grow, see what you become.'

*I've got nothing left.* Harry dragged himself to his feet.

The yew wand snapped up.

He threw up a flickering, faint shield and conjured a swarm of dark butterflies. *I can't win. I can't even apparate away to try again because the Ministry has trapped us here.* A bubble of mirth burst in his throat, but the laughter died on his tongue. *And after I'm dead, Voldemort won't stop at Britain. One day, he'll hurt Fleur.*

Harry raised his wand and scrawled runes of purple flame into the air. 'One final defeat,' he whispered. 'Then nothing.' He finished the last of the runes and watched the colours burst against his shield, watched the butterflies explode into wisps of dark mist, and felt the emptiness claw at his heart. 'You'll have me soon enough,' he told it. 'Forever. But you *can't* have her.'

*All that time trying not to repeat my mistakes and I never learnt.* Harry closed his eyes and let the silver-haired, green-eyed girl dance and laugh with her mother behind cold glass. *Perfect wishes don't come true.*

He opened his eyes, drawing the magic in the purple runes into himself as the last of his butterflies exploded into black mist and his shield burst. Voldemort swept the smoke away and levelled his wand at Harry's heart.

Harry let the Elder Wand slide through his fingers.

Voldemort's eyes widened. The question hung in them, off

every line in the shock upon his face.

*Why?* Harry drew himself up and let a small smile spread across his lips. *For Fleur.As always.*

A brilliant emerald flash washed the world away.

# ...Are For Stories Yet Unfinished

A girl with silver hair clutched at a slim chain about her neck, twisting it so tight over her knuckles it drew blood. Dust settled over the blank green eyes and dark robes at her feet.

\'For you,' he murmured. 'He did this for you.'

*As always.* A soft little whisper welled up in the back of his

mind.

'You were real.' He thrust out a hand and the pale wand

floated to his fingers from beside the corpse. 'One last dream still remained.'

The silver-haired girl gathered the body beneath her into her arms. White feathers bristled from her skin and tears trickled from irises as dark as night. Azure flames flickered up about her feet, dancing on the stones like little candle flames.

'He was more than you will *ever* be,' she hissed.

He levelled his new wand at her, but the breath caught in his throat and the words died on his tongue. *Sacrifice.* A soft smooth thought rose up from the base of his skull.

'You are protected by his sacrifice,' he said. 'And Lord

Voldemort does not forget his mistakes, he learns from them.'

She wavered to nothing.

A strange melancholy fell upon him as he stared over the rubble and the ash, a thick, grey shroud smothering all sense of triumph.

'Fleur.' The name slipped from his lips. 'Fleur Delacour.'

*How could he choose to die for her? She would've only*

*betrayed him in the end.*

Red-robed aurors and hit-wizards appeared among the rubble, spells flashing between them and his dark-robed Death Eaters. A one-armed auror jumped up atop the rubble, hurling curses. He swatted them aside and closed the air around him like a fist, ripping the man's spinal column out and watching him roll away down into the dust. Azure flames crept across the stones and the stink of burning flesh filled his nostrils. The stark, grey walls of the orphanage burnt before the eye of his mind, orange tiles crumbling into flame and smoke swirling across London streets.

A witch in tattered red robes scrambled up the mound and

threw herself at him. 'Avada kedavra,' she screamed.

A single black butterfly exploded from his wand and swallowed the flash of green, bursting into black smoke. He opened her throat with a flick of his wand and a cutting curse, watching the bright crimson liquid spurt out onto the stones.

*Blood.*

The world stretched off into the distance as the witch clutched at her neck, gasping and collapsing back into the rubble, her heels kicking in the dust.

*It\'s lonely, isn\'t it?* A girl's voice echoed up from the back of his mind, her heels swinging from the top bunk. *Like not quite being real.*

He squeezed his eyes shut and shook his head but wide- framed, cheap glasses hovered behind his eyelids. 'What magic is this?' he whispered. 'What did he *do?'*

*I've no horcruxes to anchor me.* A stab of fear lanced through him. *If I die, I'll be nothing again.*

Azure flames curled across the stones, Death Eaters and hit wizards duelled among them and the dead burnt, filling the air with the reek of scorched flesh. A flash of white light burst at the courtyard's edge, searing his eyes.

*Stupid boy.* In his mind's eye, his blistered, raw hands scrubbed burnt bacon from the bottom of the pan. *If you've ruined the Teflon, you'll have no breakfast all week to make up the cost of it.*

Adull, low ache bit into his temple, throbbing with each beat of his heart.

The scorched figure of a dark-haired witch appeared on the crumbling roof with a loud crack and poured cherry-red flames at him from the tip of her wand. He ripped the Fiendfyre from her control and set it free.

*Burn.* The throbbing intensified and his head spun. *Let them*

*all burn.*

He clapped a hand to his forehead and dug his fingers into

his skull until the pain drowned the ache and blood trickled down his scalp. The witch burnt as the fire rushed over her, screaming and flailing and leaping from the roof to splatter across the stones at his feet.

Thick, black smoke closed over him, stinging his eyes.

He squeezed them shut. *I'm sorry, Tom.* Hot tears burnt against his lashes and the throbbing in his skull began to pound. *I still love you.*

'Love me?' he whispered, the words slipping off his tongue.

'If you loved me, you wouldn't have done it.'

White tiles flashed before his eyes. The girl with glasses sobbed over silver taps and pale basins. A slim dark book echoed his thoughts back at him off its pages, resting upon a pile of old tomes.

*If she couldn't understand, none of them will.* The thought rose up from the dark of his mind like mist curling off the pool in the Chamber of Secrets. *There're no dreams left.*

A painted figure turned its back on him as he ripped threads of magic from its canvas and a girl of grey mist wailed into a puddle of water on the bathroom floor. Red eyes burnt like coals in the sockets of his reflection, stained scarlet as his soul. His followers shrank back, wide-eyed and pale.

*There's only power. The power to do something great.* A name hung on the tip of his tongue, dancing out of reach with a green-eyed girl beyond cold glass. *And her.*

The silver-haired girl smiled beneath a summer sky, framed by bright, green leaves. Her lips tasting of marzipan; her eyes shining with soft, warm light.

His heart lurched.

*Fleur.*

A desperate yearning ripped through him, sharp as razors, hot as flame. The shadow of the grey girl with glasses hovered beyond her beneath dark skies.

*One of two.* He tore open his eyes and clutched at his head, but the pounding ripped deeper, crashing like thunder with each beat

of his heart. *One of us was betrayed by the girl in the bathroom. The other found a girl beneath a summer sky.*

A flicker of white snatched the Elder Wand from his hand in a flash of pain. Hot blood trickled down his wrist, dripping into the flames around his feet with a soft hissing.

*Which am I?* He slipped the long, pale yew wand from his sleeve and stared at it, spinning it \'round in his fingers as the inferno swallowed the world around him.

*And either must die at the hand of the other.* A hoarse rasp rose from the back of his mind over a tangle of cold fury and hot hate. The words seeped through the stilted, twisted, warped memories of two shattered souls. *For neither can live while the other survives.*

He closed his eyes.

Scattered, tattered shadows clawed at one another in the dark; bound in foreign flesh, thrust together, mutilated and merged.

*But which am I? How do I win?*

Above white tiles, the girl of grey mist faded to nothing with a tearful smile.

Heat licked at him, biting at his skin. He opened his eyes.

Red flames ran along the length of his wand, flickering in his dark robes. He thrust his wand at them, but the pale yew crumbled to ash, slipping through his fingers. The fire ate into him in searing hot waves, curling into his flesh like burning hooks.

Dark mist swirled amidst the smoke.

*It doesn't matter which I am.* He closed his eyes and pictured the green-eyed little girl smiling behind cold glass, letting

the world and its agony drift far into the distance. *Perfect wishes*

*don't come true.*

# A Cadmean Victory

The fading sunlight spilt through the green leaves of the willow tree, falling in dappled patterns across white pebbles, sparkling clear water and glimmering crystal.

Fleur lifted the silver chain over her head, placing the little silver acorn and the gold band with its dark stone upon the tomb's clear, hard stone. 'Gabby and I tried again now she's with me at Les Inconnus.' She pulled Harry's wand from her sleeve and a fist of emotion clamped itself about her throat. 'But we failed again.'

A faint smile hovered beneath the crystal.

She rolled the wand between her fingers, listening to the echo of Harry\'s magic within it. 'Britain is still changing. The Ministry of old is all but gone, washed away in the wake of war, and a new country is rising. You\'re a hero again.' A brief laugh burst from her lips. 'You'd've*hated* how they talk about you now. When Gabby and I succeed, we can laugh about it together, monCœur.'

*No matter how long it takes.*

Fleur clutched the wand to her chest and closed her eyes, burying herself in the soft murmur within it. 'Why did you have to die?' she whispered.

A soft hoot drifted down from the branches above.

*An owl?* Fleur\'s eyes snapped up. *How did it get through my wards?*

A ball of grey-tinged, moulting, bedraggled feathers fluttered down upon the crystal tomb and a pale, knotted wand dropped to bounce across the tomb's top.

Fleur caught it as it rolled off the edge. 'The Elder Wand...'

Glazed, dazed amber eyes peered from beneath rotting plumage.

'Hedwig,' Fleur murmured. 'You look *awful*.'

Hedwig let out a low hiss and dragged herself forward.

Fleur snatched Harry's wand and her necklace back out of the way as a raw, hoarse, rasp rattled from Hedwig's beak. Tendrils of dark mist curled off her mouldering feathers as she flopped into the pebbles at Fleur's feet.

Shadows coalesced above the tomb; shapeless, faceless

dark.

Fleur's breath caught and she clutched Harry's wand to her

heart. *Don't hope.* She tried to crush the swell of it beneath the hammering of her heart. *Don't wish.*

The shadow faded like morning mist before the sun and a soft breeze whispered through the willow's leaves, rustling in the grass. Fish darted beneath the ripples of the river and gentle birdsong chorused from the trees and wildflower fields.

Fleur sucked in a gulp of air and let her heart sink, squeezing her eyes shut until tears trickled down her cheeks. 'That's why we don't wish, Fleur, because wishes never come true.'

A slim crack snaked along the clear crystal, splitting Harry's

faint smile in half.
