***No. 4 Privet Drive***

***9:34 PM***

The summer had been stiflingly hot on Privet Drive. One of the more brutal months of July that any could remember was well and truly underway; the relentless sun seemed to attempt to scorch all mortals subjected to its almighty light.

Even the evening offered little reprieve.

It was one of the first Friday nights of the summer. The sun had set, yet still, the heat was unbearable. It was a thick, humid heat that made breathing a task in and of itself. As the natural light waned, the air only seemed to thicken, growing denser in unison with the ever-present population of bugs which were a whole different kind of menace all on their own.

Not that the small, bespectacled youth sitting in the smallest bedroom in one of the startlingly uniform houses on this street would have known any of this.

He sat on the edge of a battered old cot and stared vacantly out of the open window. His eyes were naturally attracted to the nearest streetlight, but they weren't really seeing it. They weren't seeing much of anything, for this boy's mind was firmly on things that he considered far more consequential than the blisteringly hot air outside.

Not that he had gotten to experience the outdoors at all that summer.

Despite the horrific expedition that he had experienced after being plucked straight from the Hogwarts Express, Harry Potter had made it back onto Platform Nine and Three-Quarters intact. He had done so while violently shaking and doing his best not to vomit at the memory of the mutilated bodies he had seen, but he had arrived back nonetheless.

No sooner than he had arrived --- in perfect unison with the train, he might add --- he had been approached and escorted back through the barrier by the Malfoy family. Lucius's conversation with Uncle Vernon had been interesting. The man had told his uncle that if Harry wrote him or his children with any complaints of mistreatment, Lucius himself would be arriving at Privet Drive and the Dursleys would have hell to pay.

This unfortunately accomplished the exact opposite of what Lucius had intended.

The Dursleys had treated Harry surprisingly well that first night. He had eaten a quiet dinner with the family and been given more food than he could ever remember eating before. He hadn't even been forced to make it, which --- before being given his own bedroom after Hagrid's shocking arrival last summer --- would have been a first in its own right.

It hadn't been until the next morning that Harry realized exactly what had happened.

He would like to think that normally he would have been more than perceptive enough to realize exactly what was going on with the Dursley family. He thought that maybe he would have even gleaned their intentions in a manner similar to how he had gleaned Draco's regarding Hagrid and the dragon, even if he had ignored them at the time.

The problem was, nothing about his psyche on that night had been normal.

Only weeks earlier, Harry Potter had come face-to-face with his parents' murderer; a man who also just so happened to be the most feared dark lord the British Isles had ever seen --- Lord Voldemort.

Voldemort had completely shattered Harry's worldview in the span of a single conversation and forced him to rethink everything he thought he had known. He had forced him to consider things that just seemed quintessential when discussing the magical world; things that Harry had never considered before.

And those considerations had led to groundbreaking and mildly disturbing revelations for Harry that he wasn't entirely sure how to feel about.

But that hadn't been enough for Voldemort.

The reason they had come face-to-face in the first place was because the Dark Lord had been attempting to steal the Philosopher's Stone from Hogwarts; an artifact so powerful that it could have restored him to his old powers.

The problem for Voldemort was that the stone had been under the protection of Albus Dumbledore --- a man many considered to be the greatest wizard of modern times. A weakened Voldemort was confronted by the Headmaster before he could make off with his spoils, forcing him to hold a student, Neville Longbottom, hostage.

That confrontation had ended with Harry making a poor and brash decision.

He was confident at the time that Voldemort had been suitably distracted by Dumbledore, so he had taken his opportunity to strike. Not necessarily because he disagreed with the man's ideologies. Much of what he had said rang more true with Harry than he would likely ever admit aloud. His goals weren't the problem so much as his methods. Holding a child hostage was something Harry had fundamental problems with. He had felt like a hostage for much of his life, so he had a hard time just letting Voldemort kill an innocent eleven-year-old boy and permanently scar yet another family.

Yet his decision had led to the very thing he had hoped to prevent.

Harry had vanquished Voldemort once more through the use of a miraculous sort of power he hadn't known was at his disposal.

Unfortunately, the Dark Lord had not gone down peacefully.

He had immediately and gruesomely murdered Neville Longbottom as soon as Harry had struck him. So in the end, Harry had felt as though he'd come off as the loser in that particular confrontation.

One would reasonably assume that had been the most harrowing thing that had happened to eleven-year-old Harry Potter that month, but they would inexplicably be mistaken.

On the train ride back to London, he had been lured into a trap by Gemma Fawley --- the then Hogwarts Head Girl who befriended him months earlier. She had given him what he later realized was a portkey.

A portkey that had taken him straight to a place that had since haunted his nightmares.

If landing in a dark, mysterious place with no idea where you were or why you were there in the first place hadn't been enough, the sight of three corpses with horribly contorted necks and spines protruding up through their skin like kebab skewers had certainly done it.

If that hadn't, the sight and sounds of Gellert Grindelwald's introduction certainly had.

***The Past***

***June 20, 1992***

***Nurmengard Prison***

***9:41 PM***

Harry lay on the stone floor, immobilized by terror, as he stared in shocked horror at the second dark lord with whom he had crossed paths with in the past three weeks.

Voldemort had been terrifying. Harry had spent the better part of a year being taught to fear the man's very name. He had heard tales of the Dark Lord's power at the height of his reign. He had heard of how he'd very nearly subjugated Magical Britain under his rule, despite Dumbledore's opposition, and he had seen first hand what the man was capable of. Even when *weakened* and *desperate.*

But Gellert Grindelwald terrified him in an entirely different way.

He was an unknown. Harry knew that he had once sought to ravage Europe. The man's reign of terror had centred on matters pertaining to the Statute of Secrecy, if he remembered correctly. And his newfound feelings --- which Voldemort had incited --- complicated his views on that.

It was natural to fear the unknown, but this exact unknown had made him painfully aware of exactly how dangerous it really was.

Grindelwald had managed to orchestrate Harry's elaborate kidnapping despite the fact he had been trapped in his own prison for the past forty-seven years. Not to mention the dead and disfigured corpses whom Harry assumed to be guards.

This was all far too much.

He tried to stand but for a third time, his legs failed him.

"It would do you no good," said Grindelwald. "I lurk behind these bars because of my own prowess. This prison is inescapable for even I. Whilst this cell confines me, I cannot escape, and those on the outside are as incapable of reaching me as I am them." His lips twisted upwards. "Unfortunate though it may be that it is of no assistance in freeing me, the fact remains that the wards of this prison answer only to me. Do not run, Harry Potter. You would not get far."

"Wha... why am I here?"

Harry's voice nearly cracked even while speaking that one sentence. He was almost beyond being terrified now. The initial, nauseating horror that had gripped him had since begun to ebb away, only to be replaced by a hollow feeling of dread and numbness; an odd combination, to be certain.

Grindelwald's lips curved upwards into a smile. "You are here because the songs of prophecy sung to me a most beautiful melody. One I could not possibly ignore in good conscience."

"I don't---"

"They sang for you, Harry Potter. They sang of the famed Boy-Who-Lived and of all he could become. They sang of exactly what could happen if he was guided in the right direction, and they sang of victory for a noble cause which I have long believed as dead as many who once opposed it."

Harry finally stood unsteadily to his feet. "I don't get it," he admitted. "I d-don't understand."

Grindelwald studied him very intently, bluish-silver eyes flickering maliciously in the conjured light he held in his palm. The light seemed to dance across their surface like it might be a sheet of ice, but no natural creation should be able to sparkle with such cunning and malevolence.

"No," he mused, "I suppose you do not." He took a long moment of pause. "What do you think of muggles, Harry Potter?"

The question caught him off guard and Harry's initial impulse was to not answer it. Then he remembered what Grindelwald had said about the wards. There was of course the possibility he had been bluffing, but Harry somehow didn't think so. He doubted a man capable of making this meeting happen despite their circumstances needed to bluff.

Hell, he wondered if Grindelwald already knew the answer to his question.

He remembered speaking with Dumbledore in the hospital wing following the confrontation with Voldemort. He thought back to what the man had said about magics which could read and alter one's thoughts, and he shuddered. His knowledge of Grindelwald may have been scarce, but one as powerful as the one-time dark lord would surely know of such magics. Harry would not be surprised in the slightest to learn that the now emaciated prisoner standing before him was a master practitioner of the art.

"I... I---"

"You hate them."

"I... don't know if---"

"You might not yet realize it, but you do. I have seen your past, child. I know how you were raised and I have seen the atrocities committed to your detriment. You understand their nature. They seek to destroy what they cannot control. I doubt I need to enlighten you as to what that means for our kind?"

It was an eerily similar message to the one Voldemort had preached weeks earlier, though Harry still didn't understand why this maniac had gone through all the effort of kidnapping him just to rant about the same rhetoric that had landed him here in the first place.

"Do you not agree?" Grindelwald pressed.

Harry didn't trust himself to speak. Despite the numb feeling, he could still feel bile in the back of his throat and his capacity for rational thought was rather limited at the moment. He realized by now that lying to Grindelwald was an exercise in futility, so he just shook his head.

"And that is why you are here. You harbour many beliefs I previously championed. You have the potential to be great, though it is potential that may well be squandered. Surely you have already realized many of the systemic problems our world suffers from? Many of these are exactly why you will never realize your power simply by following conventional methodologies."

"I still don't know what you want from me," Harry finally managed to force out.

"I want you to open your eyes. You agree with me on everything I have said and we both know it. Yet I do not think you would act on such feelings. You are still young and naive, and you still hold certain compunctions highly. These compunctions serve you no purpose. All they do is make you weak.

"I will not ask you to join me or to soldier my cause because I already know it is the one you will choose in time. All I am asking is that you open your mind. Examine the world around you honestly and without these compunctions. Observe everything about it that is wrong and comprise a mental list of everything that should change. Think of what will happen when the muggles inevitably find us."

"So you want to kill all of the muggleborns like Voldemort? That way, you destroy the links between our worlds?"

Grindelwald scowled. "I would never wish such a thing. Deliberately spilling magical blood of any kind is a crime in and of itself. It is the highest level of treason to our most beautiful world. Why destroy something when you can control it? Add my war to your list of investigations. Look past the propaganda which is doubtlessly perpetuated all over the world and look into the truths."

Grindelwald smiled a wicked smile. "And of course, ask any questions you may have along the way. I am no monster; simply a pragmatist who wishes the best for the magical world. If you follow my instructions and keep an open and honest mind, you will come to realize this in time."

"How am I supposed to look into all of this when I'm trapped here?"

"Trapped? Oh, dear boy, you will not be here much longer. That will cease to be the case in a matter of moments."

"You're... letting me go?"

"I have told you, I am no monster. I do not seek to harm those of magic. I am a visionary who sees what will become of the world if action is not taken. And even if I am wrong, what does it matter? We have power the muggles do not and suffer from very little of what ails them. We are superior; it is our right to rule them."

Harry said nothing. This was all far too much. First Voldemort and now Grindelwald. What was it with mass-murdering dark lords and their apparent penchant for spouting philosophy?

And why couldn't he find it in himself to disagree with them? Why did so many words spoken by two of the evilest and vilest humans to ever exist resonate with him so strongly? What did that say about him? Surely, it made him just as bad as the monsters he spoke with?

Yet Grindelwald said he was no monster and the points he made were as valid as Voldemort's. Why should the muggles be allowed to rule the world? Why were the wizards forced to hide while their clearly inferior counterparts moved freely in broad daylight? Why was it that the magicals lived in fear?

Was it wrong that Harry was thinking all of this?

And, most importantly, why was he lost so deeply in philosophical ideologies when he really ought to consider the problem which stood before him?

Harry saw one major flaw in what Grindelwald had just said, and it actually had nothing to do with his ideology. If he was released, nothing was stopping the Boy-Who-Lived from running off to either Professor Dumbledore or the authorities about this whole thing...

"Ah, so that is why you are skeptical." Grindelwald smiled thinly. "You will be telling no tales, I am afraid."

If Harry was any less shaken, he might have gasped or screamed at having his thoughts so casually read. It still felt like a horrible violation he could hardly tolerate, but his mind was plagued so deeply by other things, it somehow seemed minor in comparison.

"What is there to stop me?"

"Only an enchantment." Grindelwald held up the hand not holding aloft the magical light and something levitated from off of his cot. It was a chain, of sorts; its pendant emblazoned with an odd, triangular symbol that Harry had never seen before. "This portkey will take you out of Nurmengard and place you precisely back on the platform you were set to arrive on. By touching this pendant, you will be activating a binding magical contract forbidding you from telling any of this incident or any other involving myself without my express permission. This contract will even protect said information from slip-ups or psychic attacks."

That was simultaneously the most terrifying and ingenious thing Harry had ever heard. The wonders of magic never failed to amaze him. Whenever he thought he had grown accustomed to this world, something else would make itself known to him and make him feel like he had that first day when wandering into Diagon Alley.

Then again, this was Gellert Grindelwald. No matter what anyone thought of the man, no historian had ever contested the fact that he was one of the most brilliant magicians to walk the earth.

The choice was easy. Not being able to tell anyone about this paled in comparison to the far less desirable alternative. Especially considering that Harry wasn't even sure if he would have told anyone anyway. Most would have thought him insane and, once more, he just... had no real reason to tell anyone. What were they going to do if Grindelwald could control the wards? And honestly, did Harry even want them to do anything?

"So you brought me all the way here just to lecture me and then let me go?"

Grindelwald laughed for the first time. The gesture wracked his body and sent him into a violent fit of coughing, but he recovered quickly enough. "You think much too small, child. I am giving you an artifact you already know is enchanted, am I not? I have also asked you to ask me any questions at a later date. Do try to put the pieces together."

Harry's brow furrowed. "It's a... communication device? It will somehow let me ask you stuff on top of making sure I can't tell anyone about this?"

"Overly simplistic, but not incorrect. Simply think of this place and a desire to return before closing your eyes for the final time in a day. That will allow you to ask me anything you could ever wish, and I shall *always* answer.

"I brought you here not for a singular lecture, but to allow you to digest all I have said and establish an open line of communication. Your potential is limitless and I think you may further my ideals one day. It is in my best interests to further *you* as much as I can. Any questions you may have about what has been spoken on today may be asked alongside questions of any other variety. I am quite possibly the greatest magician the world has ever seen. I know you are a curious and ambitious child. There is much I could teach you that no one else could."

Harry didn't answer. That made far more sense. It was actually wise and he didn't feel nearly as opposed to the idea as he knew he ought to. He feared Grindelwald; there was no denying that, but did he hate him? Not on a personal level, at least. In terms of what the man had done, Harry only knew vague details from *The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts*. That war hadn't been covered in History of Magic and Harry hadn't put a great deal of research into the topic.

There was also the fact that Grindelwald was undoubtedly right about his final point.

Harry had enjoyed his pseudo-lessons with Gemma Fawley because they had allowed him to work ahead of the curriculum and learn a great many things he wouldn't have otherwise. Ever since Professor Flitwick had confronted him in the library all those months ago about magical theory, he had taken an intense interest in all things magic --- except Astronomy, which Harry still considered to be completely useless.

If he had come so far in a few months with the tutelage of Gemma Fawley, he could not possibly imagine how far he could come under the guidance of Gellert Grindelwald.

Yet he knew it was wrong.

Conceptually, fundamentally, it was wrong. He should never allow a dark lord any influence over him, nor should he take instruction from one.

But Merlin... what he could achieve.

"I know you will not use it," said Grindelwald. "Well, you will, but not right away. That will come in time. How much time, we shall have to wait and see. I do not expect you to immediately adopt my ideologies and philosophies. I would be disappointed if you were so easily swayed. All I ask is that you look at things from different perspectives and cease lying to yourself before years of doing so conditions you in a less than ideal way.

"For now, rest your mind and digest all you have taken in here today. When you wish to speak, I shall be waiting."

The chain and its pendant floated between the bars of Grindelwald's cell and hovered tantalizingly close to Harry. He felt his knees begin to shake once more as the reality of leaving this place became apparent to him.

Shaking and without a glance in the former dark lord's direction, Harry reached out and touched the pendant.

Along with the familiar jerk at his navel, he also felt... something deeper within him. Something that only confirmed the existence of the contract that Grindelwald had spoken of, and something that solidified beyond all else that this had indeed not been a dream.

***Back in the present...***

Harry's mind was still reeling from all of that when he had arrived back on the platform and put in a surprisingly successful attempt at not vomiting all over the place. He appeared just as the train had pulled in. The Malfoys came immediately after and escorted him back through the barrier.

Perhaps if all of that hadn't taken place, he might have realized that the Dursleys' kindness had simply been them luring him into a false sense of security.

He had woken up that next morning to find all of his possessions gone and a completely barren room except for the cot he had slept on. He had bolted to the door and pulled on the handle, but it hadn't budged. His uncle had clearly locked it from the outside and Harry's window was locked from the other side as well. It was a small mercy he'd let Hedwig out to hunt the night before. At least she wouldn't be trapped here with him.

It hadn't taken him long to realize that Lord Malfoy's threats had actually scared the Dursleys *too* much. They were unwilling to even allow Harry the opportunity of writing to the man and they had apparently viewed the best way of circumventing that possibility to be removing all of Harry's things from his possession and locking him in his room.

Their method was annoyingly successful.

He couldn't write to anyone, nor could he even receive letters --- not that it mattered. He hadn't seen a single owl soaring near his window; which hurt him more than he cared to admit.

Perhaps Draco hadn't been quite as forgiving of Harry's cold shoulder as the Boy-Who-Lived had believed. He had expected letters from the likes of Pansy, Cassius, and Diana. Possibly Theodore as well. He was harder to read and sometimes, Harry wondered how much he actually liked him versus how useful he found him. He had stuck with Harry through his spat with Draco though, which was a point in his favour. He hadn't expected any mail from Crabbe or Goyle; it would have been remarkably out of character for either of them.

He just lounged around his room all day and tried not to die from boredom while living off the measly amounts of food and water shoved through his prison's cat flap three times a day.

After nearly two weeks of this hellacious torture, Harry finally thought he had snapped as he looked out over Privet Drive.

His mind couldn't even fixate on a singular topic anymore. It jumped around from thought to thought without a care for clarity nor consistency. Only a scarce few thoughts repeatedly occupied Harry's mind nowadays --- none of them were cheerful.

The first, and most pressing, was his overwhelming desire to escape this place by any means necessary. The problem was that his wand had been taken along with his other things. He had hidden it under his pillow, but whoever had raided his room had apparently found it.

The next two thoughts were linked in a dark sort of way that made Harry seriously reconsider many things about himself.

The first was that he hated the Dursleys more than any beings who walked the face of the earth. He hated them more than words could express and if he had the means, he wasn't at all sure he wouldn't have killed them given the slightest opportunity in that moment. Perhaps these were just wild pipe dreams he had been fantasizing over these last few weeks, but Harry thought the possibility was far from unrealistic.

The second of these dark thoughts was that the Dursleys' behaviour over these past number of weeks had only validated what both Voldemort and Grindelwald had told him.

Muggles would stop at nothing and felt no compunctions when it came to destroying what they failed to understand and they really had no place in dominating witches and wizards. Harry felt more bitter about the latter point than he had ever felt before. It hadn't been something he considered before his forced meeting with Grindelwald, but the thought had crept up more than was normal in the past two weeks and it sounded more and more true the longer his forced imprisonment stretched on.

He was sick of it.

He was sick of all of it and could take no more.

He had stayed up as long as his body would allow. He decided to give in to boredom and fatigue as he slumped back down on his bed. Before he closed his eyes, he had but one thought as his hand reached up and fingered the pendant that had thus far sat idly on his neck as a result of his own indecision.

But it lay inactive no longer.

It was as though Harry had blinked and woken up once more, but he was no longer in his room on Privet Drive. He was in a dark, airy place that he remembered all too well, for it was a place he had unwillingly visited in his dreams on every passing night.

But this time was different.

He had willed it to happen this time, and there were some oddities that were not present in those dreams.

The guards who had laid dead outside Grindelwald's cell before were gone. The only thing that remained of them were several dark stains on the stones that Harry knew had been caused by their blood.

"You have seen the light, it seems."

That voice was every bit as terrifying as Harry remembered, but its speaker's tones reflected something Harry had not yet experienced in his presence.

"You sound surprised for someone who seemed so confident I would use the pendant."

Grindelwald chuckled. "I am not taken aback to see you here. I am merely surprised you stand before me so soon."

Harry tried to keep the bitterness and hatred he felt for the Dursley family off of his face, but he knew he had failed. "I have... a request."

Grindelwald's lips twitched. "A pressing one at that."

Harry set his jaw. "I need a way out of a locked room without a wand. There's nothing inside it but a cot."

Amusement danced in the old man's eyes. "How ironic a request to ask of me. Fear not, Harry Potter. If this is how I must prove to you my intentions carry no malice, then so be it."

**Author's Endnote:**

**I said this wouldn't start updating on FFN and AO3 again until October, but I had a very productive couple of months and am already nearing the end of book 2, so I see no need to hold onto it any longer.**

**THIS STORY WILL BE POSTED ONCE PER WEEK --- EVERY SUNDAY --- UNTIL THE END OF BOOK 2.**

**I ended book one on a massive cliffhanger, so I hope the start of book two lived up to the hype.**

**You likely all think you've read the same second year over and over again, and there will be several similarities to the canon, of course; but trust me --- you will all see by the year's end that this is probably unlike any second year you've read before. In time, you will see what I mean.**

**I will also just give a disclaimer right now. Second year is much darker than book 1. There are a number of scenes that some people may find disturbing to read. I would like to remind you all again that I take no pleasure whatsoever in writing those scenes, nor do I ever support the actions of some of my more morally jaded characters.**

**Chapter 2: Corruption and Control**

***July 7, 1992***

***The Headmaster's Office, Hogwarts***

***9:00 PM***

The night was dark and the clouds were thick, allowing no moonlight to penetrate their unbroken veil. This cast the titanic form of Hogwarts castle into shadow, making the massive shape look like a looming fortress on the horizon to any who might have approached it.

Inside this structure, all seemed quiet. Almost all of its occupants had retreated home for the summer holidays; the sole exception was the place's master, who still resided in one of the castle's highest towers.

This man sat behind his desk and peered at his office's door with folded hands and a patient expression. He seemed to be waiting for something and he did not so much as flinch when his clock struck nine, nor when there came a knock at his door.

"Enter."

A sallow-skinned man with long, greasy hair stepped inside, closing the door behind him with an impressive lack of noise. He crossed the office just as silently, sliding smoothly into his place across from the silver-haired man who sat behind the room's desk.

"Ah, Severus. So long it feels since we last met, yet so short a time has truly passed."

Snape did not look impressed. "I did not come here for niceties, Dumbledore. I came here for answers, as you well know."

"And I promised you would have them; a promise I very much plan to uphold. Forgive my delay, but it is always proper decorum on the part of the host to at least try and inquire after their guest's wellbeing."

"Your concern has been acknowledged," Snape said with a curled lip. "Now, how long must I wait to be given what I came for?"

"No longer, I suppose," Dumbledore answered with a weary expression. "I fear this discussion may be taxing on the both of us, which only means it is best if we see it through with haste."

"What happened the night after exams concluded? Not one, but two students in the hospital wing and the heir of a Founding Twelve family dead without a satisfactory explanation."

Dumbledore closed his eyes and thought very deeply. "What I am about to tell you is something which can never leave this room."

One of Snape's eyebrows rose. "Was that not a working assumption?"

"I certainly hope so, but this is different. This is a truth more monumental than any I have imparted onto you thus far. Swear to me, Severus, that nothing I say will ever leave this room."

Snape watched Dumbledore impassively and the headmaster could practically see the man's mental calculations through his black, tunnel-like eyes.

Snape nodded slowly after a long pause. "Very well. Nothing you tell me will ever leave this office. I swear it and will vow with my life if I must."

"I think not," said Dumbledore. "Your word is enough for me." The headmaster sat back in his chair, running a steady hand through his beard as he thought very deeply. "You know, of course, that Quirinus spent the entirety of the school year hoping to get his hands on the Philosopher's Stone?" Snape nodded curtly. "Then I am sure it will come as no surprise to you that he decided to make his move on the very night you speak of."

Snape nodded once more. Dumbledore had suspected that Snape would assume that had been the case, but the old man thought it only prudent to start there.

"I had thought not," Dumbledore continued. "All of this, you have easily deduced from basic extrapolations of relevant facts. What I think it likely you have not discovered is that, for the duration of the year, we were not fighting Quirinus Quirrell, but the one-time master you so bravely abandoned."

Snape's eyes actually widened for a full second before he gained mastery over his emotions once more. "*He*... was here?"

"He was indeed. You will remember that, on the night we spoke of protecting Lily's son, you told me that there was no need?" Another nod from Snape, this one much stiffer. "You will also doubtlessly remember what I told you on that night?"

"You said that the Dark Lord would one day return."

"I did indeed, and this year has only proven me to be correct."

"In what capacity was he here?"

"He has not yet returned, if that is the reason for your question. It is difficult for me to hypothesize about what state Lord Voldemort has rested in for the past decade. I have always thought that it is likely something akin to a wraith."

"You're telling me that he possessed Quirrell for an entire year without the fool fighting him off or his body decomposing from the stress?"

"Yes and no." Dumbledore suddenly looked more grave than usual. Snape would have even gone as far as to say the man looked put off. "I am saying that Voldemort, in one way or another, came into contact with our former professor during his travels. Likely in Albania, as I have had my suspicions for some time that Albania is where he has dwelled for all these years. When they met, Voldemort likely disillusioned Quirrell with promises of power and grandeur the likes of which he had never dreamed of. Once he had him completely spellbound, it seems that he must have arranged for an accident of some kind."

"What you're saying," Snape began slowly, "is that Quirrell was never here this past year and that the Dark Lord was in complete and total control of what was essentially an empty vessel?"

"I confess that I hadn't known such a thing to be possible before, but it is the only conclusion I can come to. I had my suspicions that Voldemort may have been occupying Quirrell's body with the man's twisted blessing, but our confrontation at the year's end dissuaded me of that belief. There was no sign of Quirinus in that corridor. It was truly and completely Voldemort. He was greatly weakened and at most a shell of what he had been, but everything about him was undoubtedly him."

"The unicorn blood," mused Snape. "That is why so many were lost this past year."

"That is my belief, yes."

"And for how long did you suspect the Dark Lord to be at Hogwarts?"

"I must admit that my suspicions arose quite early in the school year. An attack on Nicholas's home took place early in the summer prior, which was what prompted him to deem it necessary for the stone to be more firmly protected. He had no available usages of the Fidelius Charm left, you see, so he entrusted it to me. He wished for me to put it under a Fidelius of my own, but I talked him down from that idea. That is a charm I do not want to waste now. You do not get to use it freely and at the time, I hadn't the foggiest idea that Lord Voldemort might be involved. It was him whom I was saving my usages for, in essence. If I had known, I might have been more agreeable to Nicholas's original plan.

"Yet when I placed it at Hogwarts and Quirrell returned not to retake his post as professor of Muggle Studies, but of Defence Against the Dark Arts, I won't say that I did not have my suspicions. I believe the curse on that position to be very real. So naturally, I watched him closely. As you yourself said to me on the night of Samhain, he was most unlike himself. This could have been explained away through his travels, but there were other, more troubling things."

"Oh?" asked Snape, sounding oddly detached by now.

"You had implied that night that Quirinus taught your Slytherins with a shockingly high degree of competency despite the rest of the school complaining about the man's inability to teach. This was odd to me. There was, of course, the obvious fact that Harry Potter was in the very house he seemed to grant priority; but there was also the lesser-known fact that before he became known as the monster that is Voldemort, he was but a boy. A boy who wanted nothing more than to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts upon his graduation from Hogwarts.

"The headmaster at the time denied him, citing the fact he was much too young. Voldemort even returned years later to inquire after the position again not long after I had replaced old Armando as the castle's headmaster. I had always been suspicious of Voldemort as he grew and matured, and I felt uneasy about the whispers I was hearing about him by then. I, of course, denied him the position, but he never let it go. There is also the matter of the curse on the post --- which I always thought was his doing --- and now there was this. In a sick sort of way, his actions allowed him to both study his defeater and live out his childhood ambitions."

Dumbledore's face scrunched up in distaste. "There is also the business with Argus. Voldemort and his followers always were fond of the Imperius Curse and I do not think Quirinus was ever capable of such magic."

"Yet you told no one of your suspicions?"

"I believed Voldemort to be no more than an attachment of Quirinus. Still a brilliant mind, but not nearly as threatening as he turned out to be. It was a horrific mistake on my part which may well have cost the young Longbottom boy his life. For that, I shall forever be regretful."

"There is... something I don't understand." When Dumbledore stared pensively back at him, Snape took it as his cue to continue. "You told me that when the Dark Lord attacked Potter, the Killing Curse rebounded." Dumbledore nodded. "By all laws of magic, the Dark Lord should have died. Yet he lived on as a wraith, if you are correct, and still had the power to not only plan his return, but to forcefully possess others. For all of your extensive talents, it is I who am the foremost expert on the darkest of magics this castle houses and I fail to see how this is in any way possible."

There was a long pause during which Dumbledore's expression was completely blank. Snape wondered whether or not the man was trying to piece the same thing together, or whether he was trying to decide whether or not the Potions Master should be made aware of things he already knew.

"I am not certain," Dumbledore said eventually.

"But you have ideas."

"A few," the man admitted, "though none I shall speak on without irrefutable confirmation. I am certain that it is only through the blackest of magics that Lord Voldemort survives. Magics that I will not dare speak of without just cause, even with you. I trust you implicitly and know you are very far from a pure soul, but there are some things that men are much better off not knowing unless circumstance deems that blissful ignorance to be impossible."

"You won't tell me then?"

"One day, I may. Alas, that day has not yet come. Do you have any further questions for me, Severus?"

"That night," Snape reminded.

"Ah, yes. It is my understanding that Masters Weasley and Longbottom, along with the young Miss Granger, actually thought you to be the would-be thief."

Snape actually snorted derisively, sneering at the mere idea. "Leave it up to one as idiotic and thick-headed as Weasley. I'd have hoped at least the Granger girl might have dissuaded such foolishness. For all of her many faults, I did at least think she was intelligent."

"I believe they caught sight of your injuries post-Samhain after having seen the cerberus prior to. They leapt to what, at the time, seemed the most rational conclusion.

"They decided to go after the stone that night on a horribly misguided mission of keeping you away from it." Dumbledore's expression darkened. "Young Master Longbottom had the misfortune of being alone with Voldemort in the final chamber. He was not immediately killed, but immobilized and later used as a hostage when I arrived on the scene."

"And Potter?"

"I am... unsure as to how Harry came to be there. I certainly don't get the impression he went after the stone. I think it\'s likely a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time." Snape's sneer made it known exactly how likely he thought that possibility to be. "He came face-to-face with Lord Voldemort and lost his head as any boy in his position would doubtlessly have. When I permitted Voldemort to exit the castle with the stone---"

"Excuse me?"

"Come now, Severus. Surely, you would not have had me condemn the boy to death?"

"If the alternative is the Dark Lord's return, I fail to see how keeping the boy alive could be justified."

"Would you say the same thing if Harry was in his position?"

Snape visibly hesitated and then scowled. "What does it matter to you?" he snarled. "I have never once claimed to be the peak of human morality. You should have expected this when you took a former Death Eater as your spy."

The old man sighed very deeply. "I do not judge you, Severus. It is the same flaw that drove you to the light in the first place, so I cannot revolt too heavily against it. I am only sorry your life experiences have willed it into existence to begin with."

"If you are quite finished doing a pathetic impression of a therapist, I believe you were telling me how the Longbottom boy died."

"So I was. After I permitted Voldemort to leave the castle with the stone, Harry intervened." Snape had not seen such an overwhelming amount of sadness in Dumbledore's eyes since the night the Potters had died. "He really did believe he was helping," said Dumbledore. There was an odd note of bitterness in his voice.

"But when he took matters into his own, useless hands," gritted out Snape, "he spelt the doom of his fellow classmate." Dumbledore nodded with resignation. "I am undecided if it is better or worse that Potter stumbled into this situation of his own accord and not by any machinations of either yourself or the Dark Lord."

Dumbledore winced imperceptibly despite not being all that surprised. Snape was a spiteful man when angered and he would lash out at any target in his vicinity.

"Do you have any other questions for me, Severus?" The man shook his head. "Very well, I believe that is all for tonight, then."

Snape was out of his chair before Dumbledore had started speaking and the office door had slammed shut before he had finished. The bang awoke his phoenix, who raised his head and blinked at his master, obviously perplexed.

Dumbledore just sighed again. "Some things never change, my friend."

***NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM'S FUNERAL SET FOR WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS TWELFTH BIRTHDAY***

***By Rita Skeeter***

"Honestly," thundered Molly Weasley, "the nerve of that... that... conniving, two-faced *trollop*!"

Ron suspected that either Fred, George, or both would have whistled or applauded the creativity of their mother's cursing had the situation been different. As it was, making light out of the death of a student was a touch far, even by the twins' lofty standards.

"Oh, if I could get my hands on this parasite," Ron's mother continued. "Leeching off the death of a child just to further her own career! And she goes on and on in this rag about how there was no good explanation! She makes it sound as though Dumbledore is covering the whole thing up like it's some sort of great murder mystery. Why can't she just let the families grieve and be done with it?"

"That's Skeeter for you," said Arthur as he rubbed at his eyes, pushing his half-eaten breakfast aside as he got hastily to his feet. "Well, I'd better get to work. I know it's a touch early, but I've got a long day ahead of me. Have a nice day, Molly, dear." He looked at his children. "Behave yourselves."

Ron couldn't blame his father for wanting to get away, even if his attempt had been terribly transparent. He had wanted nothing more than to get away himself for the past number of weeks, though his reasons had little to do with Rita Skeeter --- though the woman certainly hadn't helped matters.

She had written on and off about Neville's mysterious death ever since the close of Ron's first year at Hogwarts. He could understand writing an article. It was a major event, whether anybody liked it or not. He had never heard of a student dying at Hogwarts, so he could understand that this was big news. Especially since it had happened under Dumbledore's nose and in a place that many considered to be among the safest in the country.

The official story had been that Neville had stumbled and fallen down a set of stairs one night while on his way back to the common room. It had been the night after they had all completed their final exam, so it wasn't entirely unreasonable to assume he had been fatigued. Especially since he had apparently gotten tripped up by the infamous trick step, which was now being disenchanted due to the tragedy it had caused.

What made these articles so repulsive was the fact that Skeeter just seemed completely unwilling to accept that cause. She had spent the better part of a month speculating about Neville's passing and exactly how it had happened. Worse still, the speculations weren't even so much whether or not it was a cover-up. They were more so wondering exactly how bad the truth had been if the school felt the need to cover it up in the first place.

And the worst part was knowing that the hag was actually right to doubt the cover story and right to wonder how bad the truth had been.

Ron, of course, knew how Neville had died and it only made things all the worse.

It was Quirrell, not Snape, who went after the stone. Dumbledore had filled in the gaps in the story they didn't have. Quirrell had read about the stone during his travels and had become slightly deranged. He had thus returned to the school in search of the artifact, knowing it would grant him wealth and power beyond his wildest dreams.

He had murdered Neville in the final chamber before taking the stone, at which point he had been stopped by Dumbledore and --- if he and Hermione were correct in their assumption --- Potter.

They could think of no other reason to give Slytherin as many points as Potter had earned during the final feast. How on earth he could have played such a large part in stopping Quirrell, neither of them knew.

*"Well,"* Hermione had said, *"he is the Boy-Who-Lived. He beat You-Know-Who as a* *baby and no one knows how he did it. Maybe whatever let him beat You-Know-Who was what let him beat Quirrell?"*

It had sounded so fantastical that Ron had had a difficult time believing it, but he had no better explanation to put forth.

How Potter could have figured anything out about the stone, or about Quirrell, or about any of it, they had no idea.

Ron didn't know the boy all that well. He hung around with a bunch of twats, but the two of them had scarcely interacted. They had nearly come to blows over the remembrall back in September and Potter had somewhat been a part of Malfoy's ploy to get him into trouble that night. That had not been a good first impression, but the two really hadn't interacted much after that. Potter was quiet in Potions --- the only class Ron shared with him --- and seemed to mostly keep his head down out of class. He was often found in the library, sometimes alone, sometimes with his friend Nott, and on other, rarer occasions, he was joined by his gang of wankers.

Ron knew he had nowhere near enough information to have a real opinion of Potter. Perhaps he had judged wrong if the young Slytherin really had helped to prevent the stone's theft.

He supposed it didn't really matter in the end.

The only thing that mattered was that Neville was gone. What was even more surreal was that it could easily have been either him or Hermione. Any of the three of them could have advanced to that final chamber, at which point they would have met their end at the hands of a deranged Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.

Skeeter's articles just reminded Ron about that, not to mention the horrible guilt he felt for even having played an indirect role in the whole thing. If he had just been better, maybe they wouldn't have had to go after Quirrell in the first place. Maybe they could have stopped him earlier or, at the very least, gone to Dumbledore sooner and prevented the whole thing.

It was all just painful to think about.

Cedric had done his best to keep Ron's mind off of it all so far this summer. The boy had first approached him and Hermione on the train, joined by their yearmates Susan Bones and Hannah Abbott. The trio of Hufflepuffs had ridden with them the entire ride back to London and they had all promised to keep in touch.

Cedric had written Ron just a few days later and asked whether or not he might enjoy a bit of Quidditch. Their fathers knew each other at work and either through that connection or through some other way, Cedric had heard that the Weasleys had a large orchard in which the family practiced Quidditch.

Ron might not have known Cedric for long, but the boy had seemed like a good bloke on the train. The fact that he was two full years older intimidated him for a while, but Cedric just had a way of putting any who spoke with him at ease. It helped that the two Hufflepuff girls from his year seemed to view him as an older brother, which somehow just made the whole thing feel more natural.

In a way, Ron could already see exactly why they thought the way they did.

Cedric had spent much of his time at the Burrow over the summer and he had inquired after Ron's wellbeing more times than his actual brothers had done over the course of his life.

He was also masterful on a broom --- that bit certainly had not hindered Ron's estimation of him. Cedric had been the reserve seeker this past year, but he would almost definitely be on the team full-time starting in September. Ron was actually unsure whether or not he would be able to beat Cedric to the snitch. The boy wasn't the most incredible flyer Ron had ever met --- he had nothing on Charlie and honestly, Ron thought himself to be more talented --- but Cedric had a brilliant mind for Quidditch. He had an eagle's eye and a knack for finding the snitch; always taking the shortest route possible without so much as a second thought. He had an instinctual way of playing Quidditch that was simply awe-inspiring.

Ron appreciated Cedric's presence more than he could put into words. Especially since Hermione hadn't been able to meet up with him and likely wouldn't be until their inevitable trip to Diagon Alley.

During those moments with Cedric, Ron had experienced a fleeting reprieve from everything that had encompassed the end of his first year, but Skeeter's articles brought everything back into perspective.

Hell, even the *few* articles she hadn't written about Neville hadn't been at all pleasant. Most had slandered his father and his proposed Muggle Protection Act, whereas others had broken the news that Hagrid had been sent to Azkaban on a one-year sentence. Charlie had actually said he'd gotten off remarkably easy and chalked it up to probable intervention on the part of Dumbledore.

"Mum," Ron asked suddenly, an odd thought creeping up.

"What is it, dear?" his mother answered in a clipped tone of voice. His brothers and sister were all looking at him like he was crazy for daring to speak to their mother whilst she was in this kind of mood.

"Can I, or we, or whatever, go to Neville's funeral?" A heavy air filled the room. "I mean, he was one of my best mates at Hogwarts. It... it helped with Uncle Billius when I was a kid. I... thought it might help me deal with... you know."

Molly's expression softened. "I doubt it will be a public event, Ron, but I'll mail Augusta Longbottom and see what she says. I... understand this must be hard on you and I'm sorry you had to go through it."

Ron felt himself encompassed in a tight hug and, unlike most times his mother seemed to try and squeeze all oxygen from his lungs, he didn't protest nor attempt to pull away. This time, he actually felt as though he'd needed it.

***July 22, 1992***

***No. 4 Privet Drive***

***11:14 PM***

Harry's eyes shot open as he took a deep breath of air.

Stale, dry air that had been trapped in his room for as long as he had.

Earlier that day had been the first time his door was opened for anything other than closely escorting him to the bathroom once or twice a day. It had been by his uncle, who had barged in and informed him that he, his wife, and his son would be leaving Privet Drive that night to attend a dinner party hosted by one of Vernon's more important coworkers. They would be spending the night in a hotel and Harry wouldn't be let out that evening to use the bathroom.

Harry had just blankly nodded along at the time, hoping beyond hope that his suspicions about the plan he had been hatching for the past two-and-a-half weeks were correct and that it was going as well as he thought it was.

It all hinged on the wild idea Grindelwald had shared with him during that first dream vision. An idea that Harry had quickly warmed up and clasped onto like a drowning man might a derelict raft when he realized it might well be his only option.

***The Past***

***July 3, 1992***

***Nurmengard Prison***

***10:08 PM***

Harry blinked at Grindelwald, hardly able to believe the man had solved his plight in a matter of seconds. "You know how to get me out?"

"The solution is quite simple, from a conceptual perspective. In actuality, I am afraid its execution will be anything but --- though I have no doubts you will manage. Look at it as an opportunity to prove your potential. Not to me, but to yourself; for I know you do not believe in your capabilities quite as highly as you should."

Deciding whether or not he agreed with that statement would require more self-reflection than Harry was willing to do whilst preoccupied with trying to escape from his prison.

"What's your idea, then?"

"Wandless magic."

"Wand... what?"

Grindelwald smiled. "I am unsurprised you have never heard of it. Even in my time, Hogwarts was the most consistent school because its goal was to churn out as many productive magicians as possible. The problem with this approach is that it does not breed excellence, nor does it promote exceptionalism. Durmstrang was quite the opposite. It is unreasonably demanding and produces outstanding witches and wizards."

Harry frowned. "Durmstrang is another school, then?"

"It is indeed. It is the one I attended in my youth."

"So it's better than Hogwarts?" Harry had been told by no small number of people that Hogwarts was the best school in the world.

Grindelwald gave a noncommittal gesture. "Who is to say? Better is an abstract term that can be applied in many ways. I believe it is better suited for exceptional magicians who wish to reach their full potential, but many students fail out of Durmstrang each year. Many more than the numbers who drop from Hogwarts in a decade. Whether that is better or worse is merely a matter of perspective."

"Right," said Harry, "so wandless magic, I think you called it?"

"Yes, I was saying how I am unsurprised you have never heard of it. I doubt they will ever mention it at Hogwarts. Not when their penchant is to produce competence rather than excellence. Wandless magic is as simple as it sounds, yet infinitely more complex. It is the name given to any feat of magic performed without the use of one's wand."

"How is that complicated?"

"It is complicated because to use it, one must gain a true mastery of the spell they wish to cast with. Only then can they have the ability to cast it wandlessly and many could never dream of attaining the ability."

"What if I don't have the spell mastered?"

Grindelwald raised an aged brow. "Do you not?"

"Well... I have no trouble with the spell---"

"You will have no trouble then."

"But, I haven't used it much---"

"That matters not. Not all magicians are rabble who must slave away for hours over the simplest of spells. For some of us, magic is our gift. It flows more naturally and bends to our whims. I was one of these lucky few blessed with such a magnificent gift and so are you. You have also been casting with a wand for only a year, which will make things much simpler. Fear not, Harry Potter. I see no reason why you can't be free of your prison by the month's end."

***Back in the present...***

Grindelwald had explained the general theory of how magic was cast, which was something Harry had never learned before.

Magic wasn't within a person; it was a force all around them. What separated witches and wizards from muggles was that they had the ability to draw that magic in and project it back out in order to yield desired effects. They were, in essence, conductors. Some of them just so happened to be better conductors than others, which was how one wizard might be more 'powerful' than another.

Grindelwald had warned Harry not to put too much stock in this. Power was far from everything, according to him. He said he would give Harry that lecture another day if the boy wanted it, but only after he was free. The long and the short of it, he had said, was that power did not define a wizard. It perhaps indicated their potential, but nothing more than that. It was actually one of the less important factors for most wizards. If Grindelwald was to be believed, it hardly ever mattered unless the wizard in question was truly exceptional and had mastered most other elements of magic.

Wands were supposedly used because they made conducting magic much easier. Witches and wizards could just get greater effects from less magic with a wand, which was why all British wizards --- along with most others around the world --- received one at the age of eleven.

The only downside to this, according to Grindelwald, was that the longer one used an implement, the more reliant they became upon it; which was why he had said Harry only having one for a year might make things easier.

Not that any part of the plan had been easy.

Casting a spell without a wand, as it turned out, was the single most difficult thing Harry had ever done.

The concentration required was of a level Harry could barely comprehend. He had to understand everything about the spell --- even things like its Arithmetic equation; and hadn't *that* been an interesting thing for Grindelwald to explain to a child who had barely even heard of Arithmancy.

Just knowing everything about it wasn't enough though.

It all had to become automatic and conjoin with intent so clear that Harry still hadn't managed it.

But he was close.

He had known for about a week he was close, but yesterday had been by far the most tantalizing attempt. He had actually felt the lock shift, though not enough.

Somehow, he knew tonight was the night.

It just all aligned too perfectly to be anything other than the case. The Dursleys were gone and Harry was sure he could do it.

He crossed the room and placed his hand on the doorknob, focusing harder than he had ever focused before.

His first six attempts failed, but on the seventh, the lock finally clicked after nearly three weeks of waiting.

Harry's face split into an ear-to-ear grin as he practically sprinted out of his room, down the stairs, and unlocked his old resting place, pulling from it his trunk, wand, and all other magical items he owned. This door had been easier. Harry had heard of the placebo effect before and he wondered whether or not it had any impact on magic. Perhaps now that he knew he was capable of performing the spell, it would become less difficult.

Harry already had a plan.

He had heard of the Knight Bus from his pureblooded friends, and Lucius had told him at the train station, in no uncertain terms, that Harry was welcome at Malfoy Manor whenever his relatives allowed.

What he hadn't planned for was the owl, carrying with it an official warning from the Ministry of Magic not to use magic outside of school again.

Harry had at first thought it to be a note of expulsion and he had almost dropped dead from heart failure. When he realized it was only a warning, he had breathed a deep sigh of relief.

Better to be warned for breaking a relatively minor law than to be trapped in a room by people who weren't fit to clean his wand.

***Some time later, at Malfoy Manor...***

Harry had walked out onto the street and stuck out his wand arm, as he had been told that would summon the bus.

It did, though Harry had been unprepared for the speed of its arrival and the accompanying *BANG* had jolted him so badly he'd ended up on his rear end.

After a pimply teen not too many years older than Harry had asked him what he had fallen over for, he had been let on the bus after lying that his name was Justin Finch-Fletchley as opposed to Harry Potter. He didn't want the attention and thought a posh-sounding muggleborn name would do best.

Not long later, he was getting off at the start of a long drive, lined by towering hedges which gave the whole thing a sinister sort of feel. Far ahead, he could see massive, wrought iron gates that were mercifully left open. Harry briefly wondered why on earth they would be left open and intended on immediately informing Lord Malfoy of the security risks that posed.

Then, he remembered that wards existed and he had become rather sheepish and just hoped they would allow him through since the Malfoys had extended an invitation. He had no idea whether or not wards could work that way.

He was alone in the dark and out in the middle of nowhere. He felt as though some sort of creature would appear from the shadows and strike at any moment. It was odd and irrational, but Harry didn't consider it at the time.

He just slid on his invisibility cloak and trudged his way towards the manor's front entrance, as the cloak was the thing at Hogwarts that had made him feel most safe.

He was so caught up in worry whether the Malfoys may be upset by his late-night arrival that he completely disregarded the odd fact that, as soon as he threw on the cloak, all fear washed completely away.

***Minutes later...***

Lucius had been doing work in his study when he had been alerted that the front door of the manor had opened.

His blood had run cold.

The wards hadn't alerted him to anyone's arrival and both Narcissa and Draco were asleep in their beds.

He could only think of one man who might have the desire to enter his home and the capabilities of doing so in this manner.

It made an odd sort of sense, since the man had allegedly written to him not all that long ago.

Yet he did not find that man in the entrance hall of his home.

Instead, he found a young boy with raven hair and bright green eyes dragging a trunk that looked much too heavy for him and carrying something oddly silver under his arm.

"Mister Potter?" he asked, so taken aback he forgot all about the title of heir.

The boy had been apologetic and had even seemed terrified Lucius would be upset, but the man wasn't upset at all.

Draco had complained to no end about how the Potter boy hadn't been responding to his letters and Lucius had become worried the muggles may not have followed his orders. He had begun making inquiries at the Ministry in an effort to find where Potter lived. It was apparently one of the most heavily guarded secrets in the wizarding world judging by how difficult it was to get an answer.

Yet here the boy was in his home, which had been the plan all along.

Lucius did not dare think on it until the boy's footsteps had escaped beyond his range of hearing. Yet the only thing he seemed capable of doing once he was alone was wondering how in the name of Merlin he had breached his wards --- seemingly without a second thought.

As concerning as it was, Lucius supposed it was but one more reason to stick to the plan.

***July 23, 1992***

***Malfoy Manor***

***8:03 AM***

Harry awoke to a loud bang that instantly jolted him. He was jumpy at the best of times, but this was particularly notable. He had spent the better part of a month locked up in the same room; there had certainly been no sounds like that to occupy his day --- especially not in the house of his terribly normal muggle relatives.

It actually took him a moment upon waking to realize where he was. The bed felt much too warm and comfortable and the room was much too bright. His room on Privet Drive only had a small, grimy window. Wherever he was now seemed so bright it appeared as though the dazzling sunlight streamed inside unimpeded.

"Where the hell have you been?!"

It was the familiar voice that prompted Harry to remember what had happened. He knew that voice all too well; it was a voice he had been hearing regularly for most of the past ten or so months. A perpetually bored-sounding voice that, in its current state of excitement, didn't quite carry it's typical drawling quality.

"Morning, Draco," Harry muttered, sitting up on the bed and steadily remembering how he had escaped Privet Drive, been given an official warning for underage magic, and then arrived at Malfoy Manor in the middle of the night.

It was really no wonder he was so disoriented. He couldn't remember even a single time Draco had been awake before he had. It marked a first, but he supposed it made sense.

It was the first time in weeks his sleep had been anything resembling restful. The pendant that allowed him to communicate with Grindelwald was an incredible bit of magic --- no matter how conflicted Harry felt about the moral troubles of the situation it presented. Its biggest downside was that while he was technically asleep, communicating with Grindelwald didn't seem to really recharge him. Mixed with horrendous nightmares about his friends' necks snapping right in front of him and their spines piercing their jaws as their heads contorted in horrible ways whilst somehow at Nurmengard prison, Harry hadn't been experiencing much in the way of rest since the school year had concluded.

Last night had also been more than a little bit eventful. Even if Harry had been well rested, he doubted he would have completely escaped the emotional exhaustion inevitably associated with such an eventful night.

"*That's* the first thing you say?" Draco asked incredulously. "I haven't seen nor heard from you in a month and then you just greet me like nothing ever happened?"

That was when Harry remembered something else from the night previous; a much smaller detail from his very brief conversation with Lord Malfoy he hadn't put a whole lot of stock into at the time.

"You wrote to me?" he asked, still rubbing furiously at his eyes before clumsily jamming his glasses onto his nose, having to once more blink from the onslaught of light.

He had been placed in one of the many spare rooms at Malfoy Manor. The floor was made of rich, dark wood, as was the desk and other bits of furniture. The walls were a deep, tasteful green, as were the bedsheets Harry had just pushed aside. Notwithstanding the attached bathroom and the expansive walk-in closet filled with rich-looking clothes, the room's main feature was the massive, floor-to-ceiling window. It made up an entire wall and its centre slid aside on command, allowing one to step out onto the balcony and observe the breathtaking view of the grounds, which were comprised of stunning gardens that looked fit for gods; vast, open fields; not one, but two lakes; a full-sized Quidditch pitch; and a forest far off in the distance.

These were much nicer surroundings than Harry was accustomed to, but that came as no surprise. The Malfoys weren't just one of the wealthiest families in the magical world, but they also liked people to know that fact was true. Everything about this place screamed of ostentatious wealth but Harry didn't mind. He thought it was, barring Hogwarts, the single-most incredible place he had ever seen.

"Of course I wrote to you," Draco said with a roll of his eyes. "I've been writing to you almost every second day."

Harry finally stopped blinking the sun out of his eyes and peered intently towards Draco. "I never got your mail. I never got any mail from anyone."

Draco, who had seemed to be building up towards some kind of tirade, paused and suddenly looked aghast. "You... what?"

Harry just nodded, biting his bottom lip. He had never told Draco any details about his time at the Dursleys. Doing so now was doubtlessly going to be uncomfortable, but that wasn't what worried him most.

"Draco... if I... tell you how my summer's gone so far, will you promise not to tell anyone --- no matter what?"

"Why would I need to promise that?"

The real answer was because Harry knew enough about Slytherin to understand how it worked. The house was a nest of vultures. First years were largely let off the hook, as older students seemed to have a sort of honour code and mostly left them to their business. That wasn't *entirely* true, but at the very least they wouldn't openly antagonize them. Travers and his group of thugs had been a bit different, since they themselves had only been second years. His older brother who had been stopped by Fawley... well, that had been a sort of exception.

Now that Harry was officially entering his second year, that safety blanket was about to disappear, and he would be lying if he said he wasn't more than a little bit apprehensive about it. The last thing he wanted was to give his foes ammunition such as details about his home life.

The good news was that he had the open support of the heirs --- and in Pansy's case, heiress --- of some of the most important and influential pureblood families in the country. The bad news was that Harry knew Travers was far from the only student who didn't appreciate the halfblood defeater of Voldemort being sorted into the house of cunning.

He hadn't been deaf to the whispers and he wasn't daft. He knew by now that many Slytherins had close familial ties to those who had once served Voldemort. Some of their relatives had died in the war, while others were sent to Azkaban. The Travers brothers, for example, had an uncle who was serving a life sentence in the prison. Even Draco and Diana were related to Bellatrix Lestrange, who had been convicted for torturing Neville Longbottom's parents into insanity.

Harry shook his head to rid himself of any thoughts about Neville. They brought up memories that were best left untouched, especially when he was trying to think with anything resembling rational clarity.

"Just answer the question, Draco."

"Fine," he agreed with an oddly strained expression. "I won't tell anyone about whatever's happened over your summer."

And then, Harry began his tale.

It was only some time later --- and a considerable amount of cursing on Draco's part --- that the two young Slytherins made their way downstairs and into the family's main dining hall. If Harry hadn't seen the Great Hall at Hogwarts, he might have lost his jaw to shock. The chandelier alone looked like it cost more than the Dursleys' entire house, and that was to say nothing of the rest of the room.

"Ah, Draco, Harry. A pleasure to see the both of you awake."

"Good morning, Father," Draco greeted, taking a seat across from the man as Harry sat beside him and across from his sister, Diana. All four Malfoys were now present at the table, which struck Harry as being somewhat odd.

"How did you sleep, Mister Potter?" Mr. Malfoy --- as the man had told him last night to drop the title of lord whilst in his home --- asked.

"Better than I have in a long time, sir."

"I'm glad to hear it. We never did get much time to talk at King's Cross Station. You seemed most... distracted by your unfortunate plight."

Harry was relieved the man only suspected his state to be as a result of his dread over returning to the Dursleys. When the Malfoys had found him on the platform, Harry had been as white as a ghost, shaking like a leaf in a strong autumn breeze, and trying not to vomit.

"I... yeah, sorry about that, sir."

"Not to worry, dear boy. Your misfortune was truly a thing to dread. I do not blame you. I blame those who forced you into such a... position."

"The real question," asked Narcissa, examining Harry with her cool blue eyes, "is how are you feeling now? I can only imagine your treatment under the care of those muggle savages."

"I'm... okay now. It wasn't a great month."

Draco glanced meaningfully between Harry and his parents. There was a moment during which Harry thought the blond might break his promise just minutes after making it, but he mercifully stayed quiet.

Not that his message wasn't obvious. He clearly wanted Harry to tell his parents about what had occurred on Privet Drive. Harry wasn't necessarily opposed to the idea, but he would need to feel out his current situation first. The Malfoys had treated him with nothing but the utmost kindness since he had entered the magical world, but he didn't really know them on a personal level. He was much too worried about how they might react to such a tale to just throw it out casually. It also wasn't exactly easy for him to talk about, so it would require a bit of familiarity on his part.

There was also the small issue that they were adults... adults had never really helped Harry much in the past.

"I'm glad you're at least better now," Narcissa said with a small smile. "How was your first year at Hogwarts? Like Lucius said, we never did talk after your arrival back in London."

Harry clutched onto the switch of topics with the grace of a drowning man who had been thrown a life jacket, and launched into a heavily edited account of his first year at Hogwarts. He was very careful to make no mention of dead classmates or monologuing dark lords.

***The next day...***

Harry's first day at Malfoy Manor had probably been the most pleasant day outside of school he could ever remember.

The conversation about Hogwarts had taken up much of breakfast. Narcissa had professed open pride about Harry's outstanding grades in all of the wanded subjects, which had made him blush and feel oddly uncomfortable. It wasn't until several hours later that he realized why. It was the first time he could ever remember an adult openly indicating that they were proud of him. It was just... an odd feeling he wasn't entirely sure how to deal with.

Perhaps the best part of that meal had come when Harry had been discussing some of the troubles he'd had with older students.

***The previous morning...***

"You mustn't let them get to you," said Lucius. "They attack you out of jealousy."

"It doesn't really bother me," Harry responded. "I'm just a bit worried now that I'm not a first year. I'm not sure it will be as easy holding off older students who know more magic."

"Well if you are as studious as it seems, I suppose there is the summer for you to use to try and close that gap."

Harry had frowned deeply at that. "The summer, sir?" Lucius had just nodded and raised a brow, obviously unsure as to the source of Harry's confusion. "I thought we weren't allowed to use magic. Doesn't the ministry know right away?"

"There is a trace, yes, but it doesn't necessarily mean they know when you cast magic."

"But... when I... used it to get away from my relatives, I got a letter about it right away."

"Did you?" Mister Malfoy asked, leaning forward. "Tell me, Harry, could you have gotten away from your relatives' home without using magic?"

"No, sir."

"Hm, I think I'll have a chat with some old friends of mine at the ministry and explain the... extenuating circumstances which led to that particular bit of magic. I imagine you will have that warning removed by the week's end."

Draco was grinning ear-to-ear at Harry in a way that screamed of superiority. Harry had never seen him look so smug. It was odd. He had heard Draco speak of the power his father wielded many times, but bearing witness to it was an entirely different thing altogether.

"Thank you, sir. Your help means a lot."

"It is no trouble. Simply a horrible flaw in our governing system. To answer your earlier question, the ministry can't track *who* is casting magic. That is very much impossible. What they can do is detect *where* magic is being cast. They knew it was you because you were residing in a muggle neighbourhood. If only one person in the area can cast magic, it makes the job of identifying the culprit quite redundant. In highly populated areas or pureblood homes, the ministry can only detect that magic was cast. They have no way of knowing who cast it unless there are witnesses who come forward and report a violation of the Reasonable Decree for Underage Sorcery."

"Not that the ministry could detect magic here," Draco added. "Not with the wards on the manor."

Lucius smiled thinly. "Indeed. Much like many of the most prestigious homes in the country, this one is protected by very ancient and powerful magic that makes the ministry's efforts wasteful. Not that it would matter. The ministry relies on the families of students to enforce the law involving underage magic. I, for one, have no intention of depriving my children of such an advantage. Since you are now my ward for the summer, the same rules extend to you."

"So... I can cast magic?"

"Of course," said Narcissa. "If you're going to cast anything new that you think might be dangerous, do it with supervision."

"There's also the family library," Diana said with a wink to Harry. "I have a feeling you might be interested in that, as long as Mother and Father don't mind you using it."

"Of course not," dismissed Narcissa. "I would just ask that you stay away from the books closest to the right wall. Just avoid the closest few rows of shelves. Those books might too... mature for now."

***Back in the present...***

Harry had spent the rest of that day with Draco, but he made his way into the family library that next morning, keen to investigate the place.

It wasn't quite the size of the Hogwarts library --- which, according to *Hogwarts, A History,* was the largest collection of books in the country --- but it was still massive. Rows upon rows of shelves dominated almost all available floor space. Each shelf stretched high towards the ceiling, far taller than any ordinary bookshelf Harry had ever seen. Narcissa's warning actually barred Harry from reading a great number of books purely because of the volume of each shelf, but that number seemed small in comparison to the rest of the library.

The room had a very different sort of feel to it than the one at Hogwarts. Heavy curtains were pulled over what Harry could only assume to be a massive window, veiling all natural light. The room was lit only by a scarce number of torches dotted here and there, mostly at tables set up around the room so one could read with the aid of their light.

Harry looked around for some time before settling on a book on duelling. His discussion about the older Slytherins yesterday had really planted the idea in his mind that he ought to get better at using magic in combat. His mind briefly ventured towards images of broken necks and mutilated corpses, but Harry ruthlessly fought against that line of thought and dragged his mind back on track with a great degree of difficulty.

He had spent several hours in the library, sitting in a comfortable armchair, reading up on all kinds of new spells, and taking notes on all of them before the door opened loudly.

"There you are," Draco drawled. Harry couldn't help but notice how through those three words alone, he managed to somehow convey how he had spent so much time looking for Harry.

"I've been in here for ages. Sorry, but you weren't up when I got out of bed and I was curious."

"Yes, well, you were always going to end up in here eventually, weren't you?" Draco glanced towards the book in Harry's hands, but its cover was facing away from him. "What's caught your attention this morning?"

"A book on duelling," said Harry, flipping it around so that Draco could see its cover. "I've read about all kinds of new spells in this one. Not sure I can do a lot of them, but they seem dead useful."

"Ah, that one. Father warned me off that one a few years ago. Said most of the spells would be more aimed at older students. Have you tried any yet?" Harry shook his head. "Shame. If anyone our age can do them, it's probably you."

"We'll see how it goes, I guess."

"It'll have to wait, I'm afraid. Pansy's going to be here soon with Crabbe and Goyle, and Theodore is already on his way. I think Diana is having her friends over too. With the amount Pansy's been droning on about you in her letters, I think she'd kill me if I didn't drag you out to see her."

As Harry followed in Draco's wake, he couldn't help but reflect on that last statement and think just how odd it still felt to have people who were genuinely concerned about him.

Just another point in favour of the wizarding world. They didn't care if you were different, nor if you came from a background they didn't understand. They offered a fresh start and let one make something of themselves. Harry would be forever grateful for that.

***Several hours later...***

Harry, Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, and Cassius were all laughing by the time they landed, despite the fact they were all quite sore.

They had spent the better part of the last few hours up in the air on broomsticks playing Quidditch. They had played countless games of two aside, with the odd man out playing seeker. The game would end when the seeker caught the snitch. It just so happened that in addition to their full-size Quidditch pitch, the Malfoys had a fleet of brooms --- though Draco could be heard loudly complaining that none of them were any of Nimbus's last few models --- as well as several sets of balls and beater's bats.

Harry was actually astonished with how well he did. He was quite good as a chaser, though he did get knocked around a bit by the others. He was the smallest of the bunch by a considerable margin, and it showed. He was the quickest on a broom and seemed the most talented at quick maneuvers, but when he didn't manage to get out of the way, he was in trouble. He was completely rubbish as a beater, but the position he actually enjoyed most was that of seeker.

Nobody had caught the snitch faster than Harry and it wasn't a one off fluke, either. He did it on a number of occasions; by the time he caught his final snitch, he could see that Draco was visibly frustrated over something. Perhaps that he couldn't match Harry's impressive punctuality in catching the snitch, seemingly no matter how hard he tried.

The last round saw both Harry and Draco as chasers on the same side and they were laughing merrily by the time they landed near their other friends.

Theodore and Pansy had sat out the Quidditch games. Theodore had just never been interested in Quidditch and Harry doubted Pansy would be caught dead on a broom. Even if they could somehow convince her, the laughs wouldn't be worth the hours after them, during which Harry had no doubt she would complain endlessly about how the wind had completely ruined her hair and all sorts of other things he simply couldn't will himself to care about.

Diana and her best friend --- a tall girl named Cassandra Yaxley who had golden-blonde hair and deep green eyes --- had also sat out, talking amongst themselves and the younger Slytherins as they watched the rest of them up in the sky.

"Have fun?" Diana asked as soon as they landed, smiling vaguely at their unanimously displayed, care-free expressions.

All of them nodded, taking seats and happily beginning their assault on what was left of the picnic some of the Malfoy elves had prepared for them. Harry thought this oddly reminiscent of the day early in his first year when he and Draco had been flying, only to land and for Harry to meet Diana's friends for the first time before making quick work of a similarly prepared picnic.

The jovial atmosphere persisted for some time... right up until Pansy asked about why on earth Harry hadn't been answering any of her mail. The shriek she let out when he explained what had happened would have put a banshee to shame. Of all gathered, only Diana and Cassandra --- who preferred to be called Cassie --- managed not to react outwardly.

"Pathetic," cursed Theodore, spitting in the grass. "You should tell Lord Malfoy, Harry."

Draco's chest puffed out and his chin rose. It was similar to how he had looked the day before at breakfast, but Harry ignored him.

"Why though?" he asked. "What is there he can do? It already happened; it's not like he can fix it."

"With *that,*" said Cassie, "he could probably do more than you could imagine."

"Not to mention making sure you *never* go back," Cassius muttered darkly.

"Why did you go back in the first place?" Pansy asked, stomping her foot on the grass as she glared at Harry. He tried hard not to wither under her stare. "Didn't you hate it there?"

"I didn't have a choice," he mumbled by way of an answer.

"What do you mean you didn't have a choice?" asked Diana.

"Dumbledore told me I had to---"

"Of course it's Dumbledore," sneered Draco. "That old fool has to stop sticking that long, stupid nose of his where it doesn't belong. He has no right to tell the Boy-Who-Lived where he can and can't go. If Father knew about this---"

"He might have the right," mused Diana. "Well, he might have the right to tell Harry he needs to stay there specifically." She looked at Harry. "Those relatives needed to sign a permission form for you to spend Yule at the manor, didn't they?" He nodded. "There you go; that probably means that they're his legal guardians."

"But that's blasphemy!" Pansy exclaimed. "Some good-for-nothing muggles can't have custody of the Boy-Who-Lived! He's a cultural icon! Every child in our world knows who Harry is and he has to listen to muggles!"

"They're not even fit to lick the grime off of his boots," muttered Theodore. "Them giving him orders makes me sick."

"You should really tell Father, Harry," said Diana. "He could appeal this to the ministry and the Wizengamot. Between the two bodies, I'm sure we could get this atrocity sorted."

"Do you really think so?" Everyone nodded, but Harry still hesitated. Somehow, telling Mister Malfoy about all of this just seemed like he was taking the plunge into deep and perilous waters he may never resurface from. The man had been nothing but kind, yet he still intimidated Harry more than the boy would care to admit.

In the end, he promised nothing, though the thought now lurked seductively at the corners of his mind.

***July 27, 1992***

***Malfoy Manor***

***8:32 AM***

Mister Malfoy was in a thunderous mood the Monday morning following Harry's arrival at the manor. It was the first time the man had been anything less than either pleasant or neutral in Harry's presence, and the image was one he was not keen to see often. His visage spoke of a man who was not to be crossed and his very stare seemed to do its best to burn a hole straight through the newspaper headline that had so drawn his ire.

***WIZENGAMOT OFFICIALLY PASSES MUGGLE PROTECTION ACT!***

***By Rita Skeeter***

"At least the woman tore the Liberals down a peg," Narcissa observed.

Harry didn't understand most of the article, since he knew absolutely nothing about politics, but this Rita Skeeter had not held back on her negative opinions of the bill and those who had passed it. The extent of what he knew was that the Wizengamot was divided into three factions. The Liberals, the Neutrals, and the Conservatives. From the little he had read, he was pretty sure the Conservatives were more traditional in their views and that they were the ones who typically pushed the pro-pureblood agenda. The Liberals largely advocated for the passing of new, progressive bills, while the Neutrals took whichever stance benefited them at the time.

Harry had no doubts that was a horribly simplified and generalized description that did not at all accurately reflect the deeper workings of Magical Britain's politics, but he really wasn't that interested. He was more than content letting the adults deal with that mess while he just focused on school.

"Skeeter's quill might be sharp," said Mister Malfoy, scowling, "but it should have been a dagger. One right under the chin of Weasley, if I had my way."

"What does the bill do?" asked Draco.

"Among other ridiculous things --- all benefiting the muggles and outsiders --- it gives Weasley of all people the power to invade the privacy of upstanding citizens. I have no doubt he'll be here within the week. Trust the Liberals to get some trash like this passed." He pushed his breakfast away from him as he stood to his feet. "Pardon me for the morning, there are matters that I must see to at once."

Harry didn't see Mister Malfoy for the rest of that day. Not that he took the chance; he spent most of the rest of the day locked up in the library since the last thing he wanted was to cross paths with angry adults.

***Later that night, in the Hog's Head...***

Glasses clinked against the table as two men sitting across from one another each set theirs down.

Both men wore standard robes, though one was a normal-looking black and one was periwinkle blue.

The one in the blue robes glanced over his contemporary's shoulder towards a portrait depicting a young, blonde girl with an oddly vacant expression. The man looked strangely sad, just as he did every time the portrait was in his line of sight.

"So," began the man in normal robes, "why are we here?"

His flamboyantly dressed counterpart raised an eyebrow. "Is the bond of family not enough?"

The other man snorted. "Your games won't work on me, of all people. We met two weeks ago; we almost never meet more than once a month with your schedule and band of pandering admirers." The luridly dressed man frowned deeply, but he didn't deny the accusation. "You wanted a meeting badly and there's a reason."

His brother sighed and graced him with a fond smile. "You have never gotten the credit you deserve. I take the blame for that and am sorry for it---"

"You can keep all of the attention. Shove it somewhere unpleasant, while you're at it."

"Why must you make passing along a simple compliment so difficult?"

"Not many things are difficult for you, are they? I've got to make your life interesting somehow."

"Well, there is something else I have had great difficulty with this summer. I was hoping you might be able to be of some assistance on that front?" The other man grunted to show he was listening and the speaker withdrew a number of parchments from his robes and put them on the table between them.

"Oh, hell," cursed the man in black robes. "You can't be serious---"

"I would not bring something like this before you if I was not."

"You can take all of this to hell, Albus. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't laugh you out of the building?"

Albus Dumbledore studied his brother pensively. "Harry Potter is shaping up to be quite the masterful young mind," he said after a moment. "I just thought you might wish to be in a position to, as you might put it, make sure my meddling doesn't start another war."

Aberforth cursed aloud and downed his glass of fire whiskey. This was going to be a very *long* night.

**Book 2: The Erosion of Innocence**

**Chapter 4: Promises and Progress**

***July 30, 1992***

***Longbottom Manor***

***4:47 PM***

Raindrops fell fast, beating against the ground like hurried footsteps and assaulting all under the vengeful clouds like liquified bullets. The sky was a gloomy grey colour, not even dark enough to bring with it the promise of a storm; simply dull and lifeless. The air was thick and full of moisture, bringing with it the swarms of bugs who were attracted to such things.

None of this mattered to the lone figure who stood atop a lush green hill, peering down at the spot where his former friend now laid.

The Weasley family in its entirety had attended the funeral of Neville Longbottom. The affairs had recently concluded, but the youngest male in the contingent had asked for a moment alone.

He stood atop this hill, under a large oak tree, and peered down at the spot where the casket containing his friend was now buried by fresh, moisture-soaked earth. The grass all around his feet was wet and he could feel water seeping through his battered shoes and soaking his knitted socks, but he cared for none of it.

His attention was entirely on the ground and all the implications that were attached to the sight.

He had mostly managed to distract himself for the better part of the last month, largely with the help of Cedric and his older brothers, who had been uncharacteristically understanding --- even though they knew nothing of the circumstances which had truly led to Neville's death.

Seeing the casket lowered into the earth had brought back all the worst feelings he had experienced and all of the terrible sensations he had just barely managed to keep at bay for so long.

It was overwhelming. He felt as though a weight had been forcefully shoved down his throat. It had constricted his breathing on the way down and was now compressing his chest in all sorts of painful ways that he couldn't describe. Even that failed to account for the horrible pangs in his stomach, like someone was ringing a gong of despair deep within his innards, but it was the best analogy he had.

It was all far too much.

He couldn't cope with this, and for the first time in weeks he felt tears sting his eyes. He didn't raise his hand to wipe them away as he might have normally. He instead allowed them to flow freely down his cheeks, adding to the cascade of water drenching the ground all around him.

His shoulders began to shake as the tears came faster. Ron didn't know when he had ended up on all fours, but he supposed his legs must have given out. Not all that surprising given how much they had been shaking. He fought the urge to curl in on himself as deep, wracking sobs tore at every inch of his being.

There were people around him now, and their voices came to him as if from far away. Voices he recognized as his mother's and sister's were the most prominent, but he could hear others, too. Hands gripped him and slowly pulled him to his feet. His vision was blurred by tears, but he could make out the sombre visages of his twin brothers, who had been the ones to pull him upright.

"It's gonna be all right, Ron," one of them said, sounding more sincere than he'd ever heard as they pulled him into a tight embrace.

The other joined in, patting him on the back as his entire family converged upon him. Ron just let his body fall against the wall of flesh, trusting them to hold him upright, for his legs could no longer perform the task.

He hated this feeling.

It was worse than any he had ever felt before. Clear thought was not a luxury he was enjoying at that time, only one declaration screamed to him, echoing and reverberating off of every inch of his skull; seeming to pierce not just his ears, but his very brain.

He would do everything he could to ensure he never felt this way again.

For both his sake, and that of those like Neville, who deserved much better than they had gotten.

He had to be better.

Somewhere in the distance, in a vast field near the towering gate that marked the edge of the Longbottom's property, a shorter figure stood. He watched the huddling silhouettes standing atop the hill with an oddly blank expression. If one looked into his eyes, they would be shocked by what they saw. They carried no hint of emotion, but complete and total emptiness, as though all light behind them had been extinguished.

"Knut for your thoughts, Harry?"

The boy stiffened and slowly turned, pushing aside a great deal of hair that had become stuck to his forehead thanks to the rain, and met the gaze of a man whom he had not expected to see.

"Professor Dumbledore?"

The man was dressed in plain black robes for the occasion, which somehow looked more strange on him than his usual, flamboyant style. His eyes were less vivid than he was accustomed to. Perhaps it was just Harry's imagination, or perhaps it was the water making his half-moon spectacles appear less transparent. It was impossible to be sure.

"I thought it only right to come and pay my respects," said the old wizard. "Especially as I feel most personally responsible for the travesty we all presently grieve over."

His eyes looked past Harry and up to the top of the hill, where the Weasleys were now gently guiding a very distraught Ron away.

"A very powerful thing, death. Perhaps not quite equal to the force of love, but it touches many just as deeply. Like its counterpart, it is as terrible as it is beautiful." Dumbledore sighed. "In this case, I fear it is firmly and completely the former. Let us hope that those like young Ronald Weasley keep their eyes on the light and make the best of what they feel, for there is always hope, even in the darkest of times."

Harry just nodded; he could think of no other response appropriate for such wisdom.

When it became apparent the younger boy would not speak, Dumbledore turned back to look at Harry. "I must confess, I had not expected to see you at this gathering. Please do not take this as a lack of enthusiasm to see you, I just find myself surprised, is all. Between the two of us, it is an occurrence which doesn't happen all that often." Harry shuffled uncomfortably, painfully aware of how the headmaster had been the one who'd asked him to return to Privet Drive. "Might I assume that you are no longer residing at your aunt and uncle's?"

"I'm not, sir."

"May I ask why?"

"They... didn't treat me well."

Dumbledore's face fell. "It pains me to hear. I do hope you will consider returning to them next summer with extra precautions in place, but I will not press the matter. They are your legal guardians, but I will not condone their mistreatment of you. Perhaps in time, you will trust me enough to explain what it is that has happened."

"I hope so, sir."

Dumbledore studied him very closely. "How are you holding up, my dear boy? I have no doubt it has been a trying month for you."

"I'm... all right, sir. It was... a really hard week or two, but I had a lot of time to think about things. I... actually wasn't sure I would come here. I didn't really know Neville. What happened to him is awful, but I kind of just saw it. I wish I hadn't, but I'm sort of... numb to it now."

"A perfectly understandable reaction. You saw something so horrible I would never wish it upon anyone, regardless of their age. It is not at all surprising that you have had some difficulties processing everything. I know it must be trying, especially since the circumstances of such a thing aren't ones you can speak of with any who have not been made privy to them. If you ever have the need, I am always happy to receive correspondence from one in a position like the one you find yourself in now. Or, of course, speak more directly once the school term begins."

"Thank you, sir. It... means a lot, since I know you're so busy."

"Think nothing of it, Harry. An old man will always find the time for those who will succeed him." He checked the watch on his wrist. "Speaking of time, I am afraid it is making a fool of me once again. It was a pleasure seeing you and I apologize once more for all you have been through at such a young age. I look forward to our time together this year, but for now, I must be off."

Harry watched with the same blank numbness and ignored the way water streamed from the mop of hair over his face and glasses as Dumbledore stepped off the property and disappeared in a swirl of robes.

***That night, at Malfoy Manor...***

The day had been sombre, even though Harry was the only one in the Malfoy home truly affected by Neville's passing. It had been Narcissa and Mr. Malfoy who had encouraged Harry to attend the funeral. Narcissa had said it might help him cope with such things, while Lucius had said it would be best for his public image if he were seen at such a gathering. Harry had been more than a little bit reluctant, but he had eventually acquiesced.

He found himself in an odd headspace by the time he returned to the manor that evening. After dinner, he retreated to his room, burying himself deep in the compendium on duelling and not looking up until a soft knock on his door jolted him hours later.

"Come in."

The door opened silently and Harry found himself surprised by whom it had admitted.

"Mrs. Malfoy?"

He had been expecting Draco or even Diana. The form of their mother surprised him and the look she levelled him with froze him in place. "I have told you, Harry, to call me Narcissa. My husband might insist on formality to keep his image intact, but we are family."

"Sorry," Harry mumbled, casting his eyes around the room and away from the woman's face as he tried not to blush.

She waved a hand. "I didn't come and find you to talk about silly things like names and formalities." Harry adjusted his gaze to rest upon her once more, asking a voiceless question with his stare alone. "I came to check on you, Harry. How are you feeling?" When he looked confused, she sighed. "I know the Longbottom boy's death has bothered you more than you've let on. Your nonchalance might fool Draco, but it hasn't fooled any of the rest of us."

Harry actually did blush this time, but he got it under control in short order. "I'm okay. I... didn't really know him. It was just... a surprise. I've heard our families were allies for a long time."

That part was actually true. He had read up more on the Longbottoms after Neville's passing and it was indeed true that their two families had fought alongside one another in many of the most harrowing wars Europe had seen over the centuries. The fact also made for a good cover story in situations like this one.

"You don't need to know someone for death to affect you," said Narcissa. "It's a very scary thing for all of us, especially for someone your age. Have you ever experienced it before?" She looked pained. "Disregarding your parents, of course, since you were too young to really understand when it happened."

He shook his head. No one he had known had died whilst he'd been living with the Dursleys. None of their closely related family had either, as far as he knew. The closest thing he had come to gaining experience with death was the old cat lady, Mrs. Figg, telling him about how some of her pets had passed away over the years.

"It isn't something you can understand until it happens. It's a thing all of its own. I just want to make sure you're doing all right, because plenty of people your age don't handle it well."

"I'm doing okay, I think. It's just... weird. It still sometimes doesn't feel real, like today at the funeral." He frowned. "Can I ask you something? It's a bit... I don't know how to explain it. It's something that's been bothering me."

"Of course, dear."

"And... you won't judge me for it? Or tell anyone else?"

"There is nothing you could tell me that would make me think less of you and I won't tell a soul unless you ask me to. Not even Lucius."

He took a deep breath. "Does it... make me a bad person if I just felt... numb while looking at his grave?"

Narcissa watched him very closely. "It doesn't make you a bad person, it just means you don't live and die by emotions. People react differently to situations. You won't react like Draco to the same event, and he won't react the same way as Diana. People are complicated and we're all different. I would think that's a good sign. You said you didn't know him, so it's not an unreasonable reaction. It might just be that you're starting to come to terms with the concept."

That made a degree of sense and Harry was sure she was in some ways correct.

Of course, she also didn't know how Neville Longbottom had really died, nor what about his passing had truly been plaguing him, but those feelings were passing. Ever since his arrival at Malfoy Manor, he had begun to feel better. Whether shrugging off something so horrible made him just as bad, he sometimes questioned.

***The next day...***

The oddest part of Harry's stay at Malfoy Manor came that next day. He had hardly even remembered it was his birthday, he had become so conditioned to treating it as just another day that the idea of celebrating it seemed unnatural.

Harry's routine at Malfoy Manor was similar to his routine at Hogwarts. He would rise early and make his way down to the library, then read about duelling, or Charms, or Transfiguration, or any number of things. A house elf would usually appear in the room and announce the family was having breakfast, at which point Harry would retreat to the dining room and join them.

When he did this last part on the morning of July 31st, he was assaulted by a wall of noise as soon as he entered the room. Draco, Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle, Theodore, Cassius, Cassandra, and Diana were all present; along with both Lucius and Narcissa. A heaping breakfast had been spread out before them, and Harry suddenly realized why Narcissa had been subtly probing him about his culinary preferences since his arrival.

After breakfast, they went out to the grounds. Those interested played Quidditch while those below simply enjoyed the company of the others. It was not unlike the second day Harry had been at the manor.

The unusual parts for Harry came after they had spent most of the late morning and early afternoon outside.

Dinner was served not in the dining hall, but in a large ballroom. The day hadn't turned into a formal gathering by any means, but there were a number of people there for dinner whom Harry had never met. Lords Nott, Crabbe, and Goyle were all present, as were both Lord and Lady Parkinson. There were a few other families present as well, but only one other man really caught Harry's attention.

"Harry," introduced Narcissa, "I'd like you to meet somebody whom you ought to have known for years if things were... different. This is Regulus Black, Lord of the Founding House of Black."

The man was of average height and had a slight, athletic build. His features were sharp and aristocratic and he seemed to have a perpetually haughty look about him. His grey eyes were darker than either Draco's or Lucius's and they had a searching quality about them. The image was topped off by straight black hair that fell to his shoulders and a short, well-kept beard of the same colour.

"It's good to finally meet you, Lord Black."

"A pleasure, Harry. I hope you won't mind me cutting the formalities; I've spent most of my life using them, so it's always refreshing to talk like normal people. Please call me Regulus, while we're at it. Lord Black was my grandfather, and it's always odd to me hearing that title."

This wasn't what Harry had expected from Lord Black. He was most definitely articulate and he carried himself well, but he expected someone more like Mr. Malfoy. A clean, composed politician who stuck to formalities at all times and never let that mask slip.

"Um... yes, s---I mean, Regulus."

"I've heard your Hogwarts grades were nothing short of excellent," said Regulus. "Any subjects you favour?"

"My favourite is Defence Against the Dark Arts. I'm also probably best at it; that or Transfiguration."

"I was always partial to Defence. It was my best class by a mile and I found it the most interesting. I'm not surprised by Transfiguration being a favourite of yours, though. Your father was a genius with it and your whole family is notable in the subject." His face darkened. "So is mine, actually. It was probably my brother's best class at school."

"He's---"

"In Azkaban, yes."

Harry had heard of Sirius Black. He had murdered about a dozen muggles and a wizard named Peter Pettigrew the day after Voldemort's defeat and been sentenced to life in Azkaban. He had come up in *The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts.*

"Sorry if I brought up any bad memories."

Regulus waved an airy hand. "Not your fault; I'm the one who broached the subject. Any thoughts on duelling?"

Harry and Regulus spent quite some time talking about duelling and defensive magic in general. Harry was thoroughly outclassed in the discussion, but he sat back and absorbed all he could. Regulus had a sort of natural charisma about him that just put people at ease. Where Lucius was intimidating, Regulus was the opposite --- though Harry had no doubt that the lord of a family like the Blacks could be fearsome if the occasion called for it.

Judging by his vast knowledge of defensive and combat-focused magics, it would be a natural transition. Regulus apparently used to duel in organized competitions around the time of his Hogwarts graduation. He was the adult whom Harry spoke with most that night, and Harry couldn't help but take a natural sort of liking to the man.

Soon enough, gifts were being torn open, which was the oddest part of the whole day for Harry. Most of the presents were tokenry, but a few were interesting.

Draco had bought him a book on Quidditch tactics, likely knowing he would try out for the Slytherin team. Diana --- who had seen Harry perusing the book on duelling --- had bought him one on curses. Some of them looked... questionable, but he wasn't complaining.

Lucius and Narcissa had bought him a number of things; among them were stunning dress robes, a number of books, and a large voucher for Flourish and Blotts. Mr. Malfoy also told Harry that when they travelled to Diagon Alley, he would buy Harry a gift of his choosing. Draco had looked strange and stony after that, but Harry had thanked the man profusely, hardly able to believe his words. It was like how Dudley had been treated by Vernon and Petunia, and Harry suddenly realized exactly why Dudley had been content to go along with all of it. It was a rather nice feeling.

His favourite gifts of the lot came from the Yaxleys and Regulus. Cassandra and her father, Lord Corban Yaxley, had bought Harry a wand holster. Well... he wasn't actually sure they had bought it. He wasn't positive as to their legality, which was something Lord Yaxley --- who worked for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement --- cleared up.

"Quick-draw holsters like this are the top-of-the-line. They're perfectly legal to own and use... they're just not legal to buy."

How he had gotten his hands on one, Harry didn't ask. He didn't want to know, but he thought this might be his most useful gift --- though the one from Regulus had been impressive as well.

It was a silver chain with a tiny stamp of the crest of house Black on the clasp. Harry wondered whether or not he could remove Grindelwald's pendant from his other chain and transfer it over to this one. It would make things more practical, at the very least. Beyond its sleek, aesthetically pleasing appeal, it also had very practical usage.

"So long as you're wearing it, it will detect any poisons before you drink," said Regulus. "It's never been known to be wrong and it's not stingy about what it classifies as a poison. If it can cause you harm, the chain will warn you."

By the time Harry laid his head down upon his plush pillow that night, he could do little more than reflect about how his life had changed so drastically in the course of a year. All because of one letter and largely due to a fated meeting in a robes shop.

It was funny how things like that played out.

***August 2, 1992***

***Malfoy Manor***

***7:51 AM***

Harry made his way down to the dining room earlier than usual the Sunday after his twelfth birthday. He usually waited for a full family breakfast, but such things seldom happened on Sundays, from what he could tell. It was the day the Wizengamot met every week, so Mr. Malfoy always had to leave without time for things like family meals.

Harry had been told from the day he'd arrived at the manor to just call for an elf named Dobby if he needed or wanted anything. He had, thus far, abstained as the elf gave him odd vibes. It was typically rare they saw the elves at all, but Dobby was an exception. The creature was hard to mistake, what with his bulging, tennis ball-like eyes. Harry had caught the house elf watching him from around corners on more than one occasion. He had considered telling Mr. Malfoy but he really didn't care enough to cause a fuss.

This morning though, he decided to call upon Dobby for the first time. The elf appeared instantly but looked extremely skittish. He wouldn't meet Harry's eyes and he was practically bouncing with nervous energy. When Harry made his request for an early breakfast, the elf popped away at once, and Harry found breakfast was served only a few minutes later.

He propped up both the compendium on duelling from the Malfoy family library, as well as the book on curses Diana had gifted him just days earlier and read as he ate.

"Are you interested in duelling?"

The cool voice came from the room's entrance not terribly long after Harry had started eating. He looked up, startled, but it was only Mr. Malfoy. He was bedecked in his plum, Wizengamot robes and was obviously on his way to the meeting. He probably planned to use the floo; the closest fireplace was through the dining room and down the next corridor.

"I'm interested in Defence Against the Dark Arts and magic in general, really, but yeah. It... sort of came to my mind after we talked about the older Slytherins."

"It's a perfectly wise pursuit," the man complimented. "Have you tried any of the spells you've read about?"

"A few, yeah."

"Have you had trouble with any of them?" Harry shook his head and Mr. Malfoy studied him very closely. "Would you like to learn to duel? Really learn to duel, I mean. Learn from those who are skilled in the art?"

"I would, yeah. I like learning about magic in general, like I said, but duelling would be a useful thing to get good at."

Mr. Malfoy's expression became a touch more stern. "If I arranged for this to happen, could I be sure you would be one hundred percent committed to doing your absolute best to improve?"

Harry's eyes widened but he nodded hastily. "Of course, sir."

The man nodded. "Consider it done then. I believe you met Corban Yaxley on the night of your birthday?" Harry nodded again. "His family is well-known for being highly proficient duellists. I will get into contact with him. I am sure either he or his daughter will be adequate."

Harry raised his eyebrows; Cassie was one of the pretty, popular girls in Slytherin. She hadn't struck Harry as a master duellist. "Is Cassie actually that good, sir?"

Mr. Malfoy's lips twitched upwards. "It is no coincidence she was made a prefect this year. She has boasted some of the highest Defence Against the Dark Arts grades that the school has seen in quite some time. At present, she would easily best most fully grown witches or wizards, though she would struggle against some of the more skilled in the art of combat. By the time she graduates, I doubt many in the country would wish to cross wands with her."

From Mr. Malfoy of all people, that was extremely high praise.

"Thank you, sir," said Harry. "I... really appreciate everything you've done for me."

The man smiled. "Think nothing of it. For all the wrong our world seems to have done you, it is only right someone atones for it. I also happen to find you a very pleasant young man whom I think will go far in time. Now, if you will excuse me, I must be off."

***That night, at the Burrow...***

A door slid quietly open on the top floor of the Burrow and a tall, gangly boy stepped outside. He wasn't the most fleet-footed individual, but he did do his best to creep along quietly; taking particular care to avoid stepping on the number of creaky stairs as he made his way down to the home's ground floor. Both of his parents were snoring away and were each heavy sleepers, but Ron didn't want to take the chance.

Once he had gotten downstairs, he quietly snuck out the back door and stepped out onto the property, making his way towards a bit of land just off of the orchard that wasn't easily spotted from any of the Burrow's windows.

He had vowed to get better the day of Neville's funeral, and it was a vow he planned to keep. He had actually approached Percy for help for what might have been the first time in living memory. He had done his best to subtly inquire about the Trace and had, to his mild fury, learned that the ministry couldn't possibly know if he had cast magic whilst at the Burrow. His parents had never explained this and it didn't take a genius to know why. They would absolutely not have allowed any of their children to practice magic out of school, but Ron was about to take that decision out of their hands.

Percy had begun to grow suspicious near the end of their discussion, so Ron had instead probed him about good books for learning defensive magic. This had surprised his elder brother so much that he had appeared to forget that he was suspicious and had even let Ron borrow a number of books from his personal collection; though he did make his younger brother promise to handle them with great care.

On his way outside, Ron nearly bumped into another figure. He drew his wand hastily but froze at the sight of who it was, absolutely dumbstruck.

"Ginny!"

"Shh!" she hissed, glancing all around to make sure they were alone. "Shut up, you dolt; you'll get the both of us caught."

"What the hell are you doing here?"

"I could ask you the same thing."

They glared at one another. "Fine," said Ron, "I'll tell you what I'm doing if you tell me what you're doing."

Ginny hesitated, but nodded. "Only if you go first."

Ron rolled his eyes and muttered something about kid sisters. "I'm sneaking out to practice magic."

Ginny's eyes widened. "Won't you be caught?"

"Nah, apparently the Trace only tells them where magic's been cast."

Ginny looked thunderous. "So Mum and Dad have lied to us this whole time!"

"Uh... not really," Ron said, shifting uncomfortably. "They never lied, they just didn't tell us. I just don't think they want us practicing. Makes it a bit easier for them if we don't know we can practice in the first place."

Ginny huffed, but Ron was looking at her expectantly, so she sighed. "If you must know, I've been sneaking out and stealing the twins' brooms to practice flying, since Mum never lets me fly with you guys."

Ron's mouth fell open. "You've been stealing---"

"Yes, Ron! That's what I just said!"

The two of them stared at one another. Then, Ron's face split into a wide grin. "Nice going, Gin," he said, raising his hand for a fist bump. His sister's eyes had widened with surprise, but she reciprocated. "That's clever; didn't think you had it in you."

Despite herself, Ginny smiled. "Thanks, Ron. I'm... uh, gonna go in and sleep now. Good luck with your practice."

Ron's focus reaffirmed as the two of them parted ways and thoughts of Neville and his own failure resurfaced. Still, it had been an interesting night and he would never quite be able to look at his not-so-innocent little sister the same way again.

**Author's Endnote:**

**Just in case it reads like the contrary is true, I am absolutely not going to bash Molly or Arthur. Molly is an overbearing mother, which is why she won't let her kids practice magic. This isn't bashing, as it is basically just her canon character and I have no plans of hyperbolizing the fact. It does not make her a bad person or even a bad mother. She has no ulterior motives and is just trying to keep her kids safe.**

***Nott Manor***

***6:13 PM***

There was a heavy silence at the table that night in the dining hall of Nott Manor. Harry would have hoped his first-ever stay at Theodore's ancestral family home would have been for a more cheerful occasion, but that was not the case.

The Muggle Protection Act Mr. Malfoy had ranted about the week previous had come into effect and sure enough, Arthur Weasley had come calling --- joined by several HIT wizards. The Malfoy parents had told their three charges in no uncertain terms to floo to the home of Lord Tiberius Nott and remain there for the evening while the raid was underway.

"It makes me sick," spat Lord Nott. "Blood traitors able to pillage the home of noble, upstanding citizens who helped build this country."

"How are they able to do that in the first place?" Harry asked, vaguely remembering something about protecting muggles.

"Because the law prohibits the ownership of a list of items longer than the Chudley Cannons\' last losing streak that are all '*dangerous'*." The man drew air quotes around the final word and sneered. "Fat lot of good it will do. It's not as if the ministry has let us put any of those items to use in the past fifty or so years as it is. It's nothing but an excuse to take power away from the noble and pass it onto the blood traitors and mudbloods."

Harry had never heard that last term, but he could guess well enough at its meaning and he wasn't sure he liked it. Muggles could burn, as far as he was concerned, but he had no quarrels with muggleborns. So long as they conducted themselves in a respectful manner, Harry had no problems with them.

Despite this, he didn't dare to say anything. Not after Theodore's father had so graciously opened his home to them on such short notice.

He did agree that the bill was nonsense though, judging by the very little he knew.

Why did the muggles need protecting? The two worlds were forced so far apart, it shouldn't have mattered, should it? It wasn't as though muggles didn't have their own weapons. And so what if Harry's opinion was coloured by a touch of bias? He was sure the same was true for the other side as well.

He could practically feel Grindelwald's pendant burning a hole in his chest. He had strung it onto the chain Regulus had gifted him with, but its properties remained the same. He didn't understand why wizards felt the need to protect muggles, but he also failed to understand why they hated muggleborns so deeply.

It was a dichotomy that puzzled him, and Harry had no doubt that the one-time dark lord would have answers.

He just wasn't entirely sure whether or not he was curious enough to dare ask for them.

In the end, he decided that he would not, in fact, dare.

***August 9, 1992***

***Malfoy Manor***

***6:42 PM***

Harry winced as he shifted in his chair at the Malfoy's dining-room table. Every muscle in his body seemed to ache and protest to his every motion. He could never remember a time in his life when he had been so sore.

Yesterday, he'd had his first lesson in duelling. Lord Corban Yaxley had agreed to teach him. He would tutor Harry directly every Saturday and Sunday until the end of the summer. During the week, Harry would be given a list of spells to practice and drills to complete each day as Lord Yaxley would be occupied with his job at the ministry.

He had completed his second lesson only hours ago and it had left him wincing. The first had consisted mostly of Harry's knowledge and form being tested, but it had ended in a mock duel that had left the Slytherin youth battered and bruised. Another mock duel had opened their practice today. Harry could tell the older man was taking it very easy on him, but he still battered him around easily. He wondered how many years it would take before he could make up that differential in skill.

Harry wasn't sure what made him want to keep going. He knew that, rationally, most children his age would probably have given up --- citing the brutality of these lessons as more than a valid reason for doing so. He oddly enjoyed it. Not the getting knocked around part, but the learning. He felt as though he had learned more in those two lessons than he had in months of Defence Against the Dark Arts lessons at Hogwarts. Quirrell --- or Voldemort, he supposed, as uncomfortable as that thought made him --- had been a good teacher, but this was a different type of lesson. Without other students, Yaxley could give Harry his full attention, which the young Slytherin was quickly learning meant rapid and meaningful results.

Harry wasn't the only one at the table who looked tired. Draco's father hadn't only had the weekly Wizengamot meeting to attend that morning, but he had also just returned from a meeting of the Hogwarts Board of Governors. They were beginning their own weekly meetings once more in preparation for the start of another school year.

"Who's the Defence teacher going to be, Father?" asked Draco.

Mr. Malfoy scowled. "That is the question, isn't it?" Harry was surprised by the uncharacteristic amount of frustration in the man's voice. "Dumbledore provided a mandatory update at the end of last month, but it was of little help. He had invited Gilderoy Lockhart to take the position, but he turned the offer down."

"Of course he did," scoffed Diana. "He's making more money selling books than he would as a professor and with all he's done, the post seems beneath him."

"With all he has claimed to have done," Mr. Malfoy said coolly.

"Do you think he's lying?" Draco asked, leaning forward in his chair.

Mr. Malfoy took a languid sip of wine before he answered. "As a student at Hogwarts, Gilderoy Lockhart was far from impressive. He started school after I had already graduated, but I still had ears in the castle. All accounts of him at that time point to him being a pompous fool who hardly knew one end of a wand from another."

"He could have improved after graduation though, couldn't he?" asked Diana.

"Of course he could have, but I don't think it likely he reached the mythical levels he writes about in his books. It's far more likely that the man is a brilliant novelist with impressive creativity and a flair for the dramatics. If I'm right, I personally commend him on making so much out of so little and wish him all the best."

"If you're right though," mused Diana, "that also explains why he didn't take the position at Hogwarts. It would have exposed him as a fraud."

"Precisely."

"You don't know who's going to be our teacher though?" Draco pressed.

Harry had to resist the urge to pull back. It was so odd having adults eat with him who were willing to answer questions. Aunt Petunia's screechings about not asking questions seemed to echo painfully off the inside of his skull as he waited for Mr. Malfoy to answer.

"We haven't the foggiest of ideas. Dumbledore insists no one else has taken the job." Lucius's face twisted into a sneer shockingly reminiscent of the one his son frequented. "It's all stalling, of course. I have no doubt Dumbledore has already found his man and is just waiting until the last week of summer to make his choice known."

"Why would he do that?" Harry asked timidly, finally allowing his curiosity to override his sense of self-preservation. His heartbeat quickened as Mr. Malfoy turned towards him.

"Because he probably doubts whomever he has chosen would meet the board's standards. Hardly a surprise, given the riff-raff he has subjected the students to over the years. It's a clever ploy, actually, but then again, Dumbledore always enjoys his games."

Harry was sure no matter who taught them the class, it would feel like a step down from both Voldemort --- as much as the thought made him shudder --- and Yaxley. Whomever it was, he just hoped they were competent. He would hate to squander a year of learning in his favourite subject.

***August 19, 1992***

***Diagon Alley***

***10:54 AM***

Hogwarts letters had arrived exactly a week ago, and with them had come the perfunctory lists of books and supplies needed for the upcoming school year. The book assigned for Defence Against the Dark Arts was relatively generic and gave off no real hint as to who the professor might be. Funnily enough, Draco had taken a harsh anti-Lockhart stance ever since his father had speculated about the man. He had told Harry with complete confidence that had Lockhart been their professor, the 'egotistical git' would have assigned all of his own books.

His rantings weren't completely uncalled for, as the very man in question was holding a book signing at Flourish and Blotts the same day they were set to do their shopping. Mr. Malfoy had been less than pleased by the inconvenience, but they hadn't rescheduled.

They travelled to Diagon Alley via floo powder. Harry had only ever read about the form of transportation. He could comfortably say after almost falling head-first out of the Leaky Cauldron's fireplace that he would have had no objections to keeping it that way. He had been spinning so fast that he hadn't been able to see straight for over a minute upon his arrival. Worse still, he had spent the entire journey wanting to vomit. Not because of the spinning, but because of the way fireplaces, living rooms, and all sorts of other things blurred past his eyes so fast that his brain seemed to just give up.

He blinked after stepping out into Diagon Alley proper alongside Mr. Malfoy, his son, and his daughter. It was a normal, cloudy day, but it seemed to Harry's eyes like an onslaught of light after the dimly lit pub they had landed in.

"I have a stop to make before we do your shopping," said Mr. Malfoy. "Harry, Draco, stay with me. Diana, you can come or go as you like, so long as you are careful."

"Thank you, Father. I'll go meet up with my friends at Madam Malkin's."

Mr. Malfoy fished a bag of golden galleons from his robes and passed it to his daughter. "Enjoy yourself." Diana waved as she made her way off towards the robes shop in question.

Mr. Malfoy did not lead Harry and Draco towards Gringotts, as Harry had somewhat expected. He instead led them towards a place Harry had never noticed before.

It was a long, twisting alleyway that looked much emptier than its larger, more populated counterpart. Much quieter, too. Almost eerily quiet in a way that made the hairs on the back of Harry's neck stand on end. Many of the shops here were... different. A few of them had boarded windows and a larger number had chipped paint. Some were maintained very well, but even several of those put Harry on edge.

Many of the windows displayed things much different than what Harry had seen in Diagon Alley a year ago. There were things like swords and daggers, some of which were still dripping with sickening green poison, or worse. Several shop windows had what appeared to be bones on display; while one had a strange-looking limb that mercifully didn't seem to be human. One, however, proudly displayed what was beyond doubt a human skull. The bones were so white, Harry thought they must have been bleached. Or, he supposed, cleaned via magical means.

The most normal things on display were books, but even some of these were odd in gut twistingly grim ways. Some of them, Harry would swear, looked as though they were lined with human skin, and more than one had deep, red stains that looked unmistakably like blood.

"Not the most charming place, is it?" Mr. Malfoy asked, watching Harry closely as the youth's eyes roamed around the alley.

He shook his head. "It's a bit..." he trailed off, casting about for an appropriate adjective.

"Grim?" Draco's father supplied. "Dark, needlessly edgy, excessively melodramatic?" Harry nodded. "This, Harry, is Knockturn Alley. They're not marketing to their customers. We know what to expect from their services. The place may look like it\'s run by scum --- and that isn't completely untrue --- but it offers services which can't be readily found anywhere else. The... colourful displays are to draw the attention of impressionable young minds who are less educated."

"Mr. Malfoy, sir, how much of what's on display is... legal?"

The man raised an eyebrow. "How much does the answer matter to you?"

"It doesn't, really," Harry rushed to assure him, and he meant it. He knew some of the older Slytherins had plenty of books and other things that weren't legal. Some of them Harry had interacted with and just because they owned things that were frowned upon, didn't mean they were bad people. "I just wondered why the ministry doesn't raid this place if they're raiding family manors?"

Lucius's lips curved upwards into an oddly cruel smile. "A good question, but a complicated answer. Politics has much to do with it, but I won't bore you with those nuances. What you might find satisfactory an answer is that, if the ministry shut down Knockturn Alley, they would have a warzone for lowlife thugs, as well as more dangerous frequenters."

Harry felt like he was missing a lot of context in what Mr. Malfoy had just said, but he noted it for later thought and nodded.

"Come along," the man continued, "I don't wish to be here for too much time."

They followed the Malfoy patriarch down the twisting street, ignoring a number of predatory-looking hags as they went, until they came to an unremarkable-looking building. It had a shrivelled head in the window, along with a number of other, ancient-looking trinkets that Mr. Malfoy seemed to completely ignore as he pushed the door open and ushered the two boys in before him.

The shop was deceptively large. Harry would never have thought by the exterior that the inside could have been as vast as it was. He idly remembered the enchantment that allowed his trunk to hold more books and items than it should have been able to and wondered if this was just that on a grander scale.

Delicate shelves lined the low-ceilinged building, many of them caked in a thick layer of dust. It was dark and gloomy, with the only source of light coming from outside; and even that was obscured by a thick layer of grime on the inside of the window. Harry wondered whether or not that was a deliberate attempt to stop passersby from spotting more than what was on display.

A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a blood-stained pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Draco cast his eyes around the dimly lit shop and quickly bustled towards and bent over a shelf of skulls.

"Mr. Malfoy," came a voice so oily Harry almost cringed, "what a pleasure to see you again. Delighted --- and young Master Malfoy, too --- charmed." The new arrival was now standing behind the desk, though he hadn't appeared to be present a moment ago. He was stooping and had long, greasy hair that looked most unkempt. He pushed it back out of his face and studied Harry with dark, curious eyes. "And who is this?" he asked.

"Harry Potter, if you must know. He is a friend of my son's and has accompanied us today." Mr. Malfoy levelled Borgin --- whose eyes had grown wide and hungry-looking --- with an intense glare. "And I will have you know, Borgin, that if so much as a word of his presence here today gets spread about, you will be hearing from associates of mine under much less pleasant pretences."

"Of course, Mr. Malfoy, sir. I would never dream of spreading family secrets about. I always say that along with the services we provide, our patrons pay for discretion."

Mr. Malfoy sneered. "It would explain some of the pricing."

"Yes, well, what can I help you with today?" asked Borgin. "I must show you, just in today, we have---"

"I am here to sell, Borgin," Mr. Malfoy cut in. "I have no plans of buying anything here."

"But Father," Draco spoke up, "you said Harry and I could both have gifts!"

It was true. Lucius had promised Harry he would buy him anything on this shopping trip. Draco had looked most unhappy about that, so Lucius had appeased his son with a similar promise.

Mr. Malfoy's eyes narrowed upon his son. "Not quite, Draco. I told Harry I would buy him a gift of his choosing. If his item of choice so happens to be from here, I suppose I will, in fact, be buying." His lip curled in a way that would have made their Head of House proud. "I did not make you the same promise. I said that you could have a racing broom." Mr. Malfoy turned to Harry. "Have a look around, if you'd like. I'm not sure you'll find anything of interest here, but they do occasionally have worthwhile trinkets if you know what you're looking for."

Harry hastened to obey and began scanning the shop with vigour while Lucius began discussing the details of his prospective sale with Mr. Borgin.

Harry found himself oddly fascinated by this place. It was unlike anywhere else he had ever seen. Many of the artifacts on display were said to carry horrific curses the likes of which Harry had never even imagined. Some of them made his skin crawl, but others piqued his interest in a way he wasn't sure was normal. Much like his reaction to seeing his former classmate's casket lowered into the earth, this made Harry question whether or not he might not be such a great person.

"Merlin," muttered Draco, "Harry, come look at this!"

Harry made his way over towards Draco, who was looking at a shelf that seemed to be reserved for high-value goods. Much of what it held were books, but there were some extremely old-looking things, too. What Draco was gawking at admittedly caught Harry's attention as well.

Atop a pillow that was a deep shade of royal purple sat a slightly tarnished ring of deep, dark silver. It was accented with gold, which also made up the effigy in its centre. Sitting on some kind of ornate chair was a man who appeared to Harry as maybe being a knight. His head was held high and he held aloft a sword in one hand and a sceptre in the other.

Even while clearly aged, the ring was stunning --- but it wasn't what caught Harry's attention. That was attributed to the label right underneath it.

*King John's Long-Lost Ring!*

"Ah," crooned Mr. Borgin, who had apparently concluded his business with Draco's father. "A man of great taste, I see."

Lucius strolled over and stared down. His eyebrows rose. "An impressive find," he told Borgin. "This artifact has been thought lost for centuries."

Borgin smiled thinly. "We were very proud of it. All sorts of rumours about its magical properties over the years, but no one's quite sure what it does. Definitely imbued with magic of some sort. You can practically feel it when you hold the thing." The man looked towards Harry with a gleam in his eye. "Are you interested in the ring, Master Potter?"

He really was. Beyond its stunning aesthetic, Harry had always enjoyed history. He had read about King John and the Magna Carta long before Hogwarts. He was sure the real history was different, seeing as wizards were likely involved since that debacle took place nearly five hundred years before the implementation of the Statute of Secrecy. The artifact just called to Harry in an odd sort of way, but the price tag had his eyes practically bulging out of his head.

"A touch pricey," Mr. Malfoy observed. "More than worth it if it is indeed the real thing, of course." He turned to Borgin. "If Mister Potter wants the ring, would you object to an examination of it by an expert?"

"Not at all, sir. We are very confident in our find."

"I'm sure. Forgive me if I do not share the same degree of confidence." He glanced towards Harry. "Is this what you would like?"

"If... if that's okay, sir. I know it's expensive---"

Mr. Malfoy waved his hand. "Our final stop today will already be a costly one. I had not planned for today to be a cheap outing, so it is most alright." He turned back to Borgin. "I will have someone come by in the coming days to examine the ring. Should they prove its authenticity, you have made yourself a sale."

Harry and the Malfoy males departed Knockturn Alley after their trip into Borgin and Burkes and spent the rest of their time in the more densely populated Diagon Alley. Harry had expected them to head to Gringotts, but they didn't. Mr. Malfoy said he would buy Harry's school things and provide him with money for the upcoming year at Hogwarts. A year ago, Harry thought he would have politely turned him down. After spending a year in Slytherin, he knew enough not to look a gift horse in the mouth, so he accepted Mr. Malfoy's offer with much grace.

After stops at Slug and Jiggers, Madam Malkin's, and Scribbulus Writing Supplies, they neared the queue outside of Flourish and Blotts. Lucius's eyes scanned the crowd and quickly picked out Diana with her friends. He strode confidently through the bustling queue of what seemed mostly to be middle-aged witches and came up beside his daughter.

"Come," he told her and her friends, "we need not wait out here with the commoners."

He led them all up to the main entrance which was guarded by a couple of Auror trainees. Mr. Malfoy conversed with them politely for a minute or so and was quickly let through. Harry blinked, hardly able to believe how easy it had been. He hadn't even seen any gold change hands.

Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view as they advanced further into the shop, seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard's hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair.

A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash. Draco snickered and quietly pointed to Ron Weasley, who the man had just rudely shoved aside. Harry plastered a fake smile onto his lips, but he didn't much care. He neither liked nor disliked Weasley, but he had a hard time ridding himself of the image of the boy and his family standing atop the hill at Longbottom's funeral.

"Harry," said Mr. Malfoy in a low voice, eyes fixed on Lockhart at the front of the room. "I was wondering whether I might ask a favour of you?"

Harry looked up at the man with wide eyes. "Of course, sir." It wasn't as if he was going to say no after the unceasing kindness the man had shown him today.

"I think I might steal a picture with Mr. Lockhart. His reputation would do me wonders after the slander the *Prophet's* been posting since Weasley's meddling." Harry winced; the *Daily Prophet* had posted the names of all families who had been raided, and the Malfoys had not been spared. "I was wondering whether you might be agreeable to joining me?"

The rest went unsaid. Harry was the Boy-Who-Lived. There had been articles written about him after his sorting into Slytherin, for Merlin's sake. Even after that, they had sung his praises, spinning it into a tale of how he might reinvent the house's reputation. If Mr. Malfoy was seen with Harry Potter so soon after the aspersions cast upon him by Arthur Weasley and the *Daily Prophet*, all would be forgotten.

Harry didn't much like the idea of posing for a newspaper, nor standing in front of the whole crowd of people with a fake smile on his face. But for a man who had shown him so much kindness ever since they had met...

"It's no trouble, sir. Anything I can do to help."

Lucius smiled and rested a hand on Harry's shoulder, guiding him up towards where Gilderoy Lockhart was still signing autographs. The crowd burst into loud murmurs at the sight of Harry --- who was impossible to miss --- walking alongside one of the most prominent men in the country. Lockhart clearly heard the whispers, for he looked up and his eyes landed on the both of them.

"It can't be Harry Potter?"

The remaining crowd parted, whispering excitedly. Lockhart looked like he wanted to dive forward and seize Harry's arm, but he restrained himself after seeing that Lucius was with him.

"Good afternoon, Gilderoy," said Mr. Malfoy with a small inclination of his head.

"Ah, Lucius, old chap! So long it's been!" Harry was pretty sure the two of them had never interacted before. If they had, Lockhart was certainly not close enough to the Malfoy lord to call him by his first name.

Mr. Malfoy just smiled along. "Indeed it has. My ward here just wanted to meet you, so I thought it only right if I gave him the opportunity. He's enthralled by your books, you see?"

Lockhart beamed with the force of a miniature sun. "Of course, of course! And I'll be happy to give the lad the whole set, signed and free of charge!"

Harry and Lucius were now standing at the front of the room with Lockhart, who took to his feet and stood on Harry's right. The boy now stood between Lucius and Gilderoy, with the former's hand on his shoulder and the latter's arm draped around him. This last motion made him tense, but he forced himself to relax as the cameraman rushed forward.

"Nice big smile, Harry," said Lockhart through gleaming teeth. "Together, you and I are worth the front page."

Harry thought that comment might have made it much easier for Mr. Malfoy to fake his own winning smile.

***August 31, 1992***

***Malfoy Manor***

***7:44 PM***

They had indeed made the front page, but that had been nearly two weeks ago now.

It was the night before yet another year at Hogwarts would begin and Harry felt strange. He loved the castle more than anywhere else in the world and in many ways, he wanted nothing more than to return to it. But he had also loved Malfoy Manor in a different form altogether. The freedom it had provided him was something he had never experienced before and the kindness shown to him by the Malfoys was something he could have never imagined.

Yet that kindness to him didn't make Harry's current course of action any less intimidating.

Draco and Diana had been trying to convince Harry for weeks to tell their father about the Dursleys, convinced that the man could do something about it.

Finally, with less than twenty-four hours until he was set to board the Hogwarts Express, Harry acquiesced. It was a combination of their persistence, his desperation to never return to Privet Drive, and the shopping trip that convinced him. The way Mr. Malfoy had treated him during that trip and the way the man had carried himself... it just inspired a great deal of confidence and Harry thought himself ready to take the plunge.

He very hesitantly knocked on the door to Mr. Malfoy's study, hoping he wasn't interrupting anything. It was one of the most heavily warded rooms in the home, according to Draco. He'd said he had only ever been in that room on a few scarce occasions.

"Who is it?" came Mr. Malfoy's voice.

"It's Harry, sir."

A pause, and then...

"Enter."

The door opened of its own accord when Mr. Malfoy spoke, and Harry saw him pushing a pile of parchments to the side as he looked up.

"Good evening, Harry. Is there something I can help you with?" His eyes watched him intently, noticing the way the boy had suddenly become quite fidgety.

"I... maybe, sir. There's... something I've been working up to telling you for a long time. Something Draco and Diana have been trying to get me to tell you."

The man raised an eyebrow. "Come and sit," he said, gesturing to the plush armchair across from him. Harry did so and the door closed on its own as he walked further into the room. "What is it you wish to tell me?"

"You... remember how I said I used magic when I left my relatives' house?" Thankfully, Mr. Malfoy had gotten that warning revoked within the first week of his stay, as he had promised.

The man's eyes darkened. "May I presume I'm about to hear exactly why you did such a thing?"

"Yes, sir."

Harry took a deep, centring breath and then began to rattle off how the Dursleys had locked him in his room the night after he had arrived on Privet Drive. Sometime during the tale, it devolved into Harry telling Lucius about how they had locked him in a boot cupboard as a child, forced him to do chores, and even punished him with occasional bouts of physical violence.

By the time Harry was done, he was shaking. Not quite at the point of becoming teary-eyed, but shaky and not at all in a calm state of mind.

"Calm down, Harry." The man's voice was softer and gentler than Harry had ever heard it before. "Nothing that happened is your fault and it is nothing you should feel ashamed of. It is the fault of the filthy animals who locked you away, and it is the fault of our pathetic system for allowing any child to be raised by such creatures."

"I just... please, sir. Can... can you not tell anyone about this?"

Mr. Malfoy's features softened. "I'll need to tell a few people if we are to resolve this atrocity."

"R-resolve it, sir?"

The man's jaw clenched. "Yes, Harry, resolve it. I will need to gather evidence and such, but you are never returning to the rabble who raised you. I am going to make sure of that --- I swear it to you."

"Does... does that mean everyone is going to know about what happened, sir?"

"If I have my way, the affairs will take place in a low-key manner and behind closed doors." His eyes gleamed. "And between the two of us, Harry, us Malfoys almost always get our way."

"Thank you, sir," said Harry, unable to say anything more.

Mr. Malfoy stood from behind the desk and made his way over to Harry, resting a firm and steady hand on his shoulder as he bent down to look him square in the eyes.

"You are part of our world now. More so, you are family, in a sense. I promise you, nothing is going to take you away from either of those two things. I will make sure of it, by any means necessary."

**Author's Endnote:**

**Just a note on the ring: It will not be giving Harry any kind of superpower that is going to win him fights or resolve major plots. It does have a function that will doubtlessly come in handy at some point, but it is not going to be a major advantage going forward. Honestly, the ring exists largely so I can expand on some magical history that will be semi-relevant to the story way down the line.**

***September 1, 1992***

***Malfoy Manor***

***5:02 AM***

Harry awoke with a jolt on the morning of September 1st and assumed for a moment that his excitement had simply gotten the better of him. The lack of light streaming into the room despite one of the four walls consisting entirely of glass indicated exactly how early it was. He typically rose before the sun had fully risen, but it had barely started peeking out over the horizon. There wasn't even a tinge of sunlight visible in the sky yet, and the stars were still shining as brightly as ever.

Excitement pulling him back into the realm of consciousness wouldn't have been terribly hard to believe --- a similar thing had happened last year; yet he quickly realized that no emotion was responsible for his early and sudden start to the day.

He felt an odd weight on his lower body as if something was attempting to pin him down. It wasn't doing a very good job of it, he could still move without a great deal of difficulty.

He sat bolt upright when he looked towards his legs and saw large green eyes. He had to resist the urge to cry out, not wanting to wake the rest of the house. Among them, he was by far the earliest riser and it would not do to disturb his hosts so unjustly.

He scrambled backwards, jerking his legs in an attempt to dislodge the creature and snatched his wand from underneath his pillow before taking aim at the shape which was now slowly rising off the floor.

"It's Dobby, sir," came a high voice that was obviously putting in an awful attempt at whispering.

Harry glared at the creature and did not lower his wand. "Why are you in my room and watching me sleep then?" he demanded in a hissing voice that was much quieter than the elf's attempts at a whisper.

The creature shuffled and cast its gaze to the floor. "Dobby didn't mean to scare Harry Potter, sir. Dobby would never... Harry Potter is a great wizard."

His glare did not relent. "Well, what were you doing then?"

"Dobby just wanted to talk to Harry Potter, sir. Talk was all... Dobby must warn him."

"Warn me of what?"

Unless Voldemort made another bid for power that somehow centred around Hogwarts yet again, Harry felt reasonably confident nothing this year could possibly top the death of a fellow student and his own kidnapping at the hands of a long vanquished dark lord.

Dobby cast his eyes around the room as if afraid someone was listening. "It... it is difficult, sir. Dobby... Dobby wonders where to begin..."

"At the beginning, maybe?" Harry suggested. When the elf began to fidget even more, Harry's eyes narrowed. "Dobby, should you even be here right now?"

"Oh, no, sir, no . . . Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this. If they ever knew, sir."

Harry wasn't sure how to feel about that last comment. He had no idea whether or not the Malfoys treated their elves so cruelly, but he thought they might have. Draco certainly seemed to view them as little more than animals. From what Harry had seen so far, he was hard-pressed to disagree. They seemed to exist simply to serve the whims of wizards. Diana had even told him something of the sort when he'd asked what the creatures were not long after arriving.

*"They're called house elves,"* she had told him. *"They're a sort of magical creature that has existed for as long as anyone remembers. If there are any records of how they came to be, I haven't seen them. They're not like witches and wizards. They have their own kind of magic that's dependent on us. They get bonded to a family and rely on them. They need to be serving witches or wizards for them to keep their magic. They're sort of just built for it; they even enjoy it."*

If this was true, Harry found it most odd that this particular elf seemed to be at least indirectly disobeying orders from the Malfoys. He wondered if the way the creature had subtly watched him over the summer had fallen into a similar sort of vein. Perhaps that was why the creature had been punishing itself so horrendously.

Harry eventually decided he cared more about answers than the moral questions bumping around inside his head. Last year had taught him that those were extremely taxing and never seemed to yield results. It was also much too early for thoughts so deep and complex.

"The warning?" he prompted.

The elf took a deep, centring breath. "Harry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great, too good to lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal danger."

Silence stretched between them as Harry's jaw slowly lowered. Even during his confrontation with Voldemort, he had never really felt as though he was at risk of dying.

"You want me to stay here?" he asked, shaking his head. "Dobby, even if I wanted to stay here, the Malfoys would never let me. They'd send me to Hogwarts, like they should. Hogwarts is where I belong; it's where I need to be."

"No! No! No!" Dobby argued, stamping his little feet to punctuate each word. "Harry Potter mustn't go back, sir. He *mustn't*... no matter what."

"Why not, Dobby?"

"There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year," whispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over. "Dobby has known it for months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is too important, sir!"

"What terrible things?" Harry asked at once. "Who's plotting them?"

Dobby made a funny choking noise and then sprinted towards the wall. Harry knew enough about house elves by now --- and suspected enough about Dobby --- to realize what he was about to do.

"Impedimenta."

His hastily whispered jinx hit Dobby in the back, causing the elf to freeze in mid-stride. The effect would only last a few seconds, but it gave Harry enough time to scramble to his feet, grab ahold of the house elf, and haul him back away from the wall.

That had been one of the more recent spells Yaxley had shown him. It was simple, but technically not covered until fourth-year Defence Against the Dark Arts. Harry found this irritating, since it really wasn't difficult to cast. It just so happened that they didn't learn about jinxes, hexes, and curses in any depth until fourth year, according to Yaxley.

"Dobby," Harry asked very slowly, eyes narrowing upon the elf who still looked deadly serious. "This hasn't got anything to do with Voldemort, does it?"

He could think of no other wizard who would strike fear like this, least of all fear that would prompt Dobby to warn him.

The elf clasped his hands tightly over his ears. "Speak not the name, sir, speak not the name!"

"Sorry," Harry said, not meaning it one bit, "this doesn't have anything to do with the Dark Lord, does it?"

Dobby seemed to search for the right words. "Not... not him, sir..."

But Dobby's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a hint. Harry, however, was completely lost.

"Well then, I can't think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts. I mean, there's Dumbledore, for one thing."

Dobby bowed his head. "Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore's powers rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength. But, sir..." Dobby's voice dropped to an urgent whisper. "There are powers Dumbledore doesn't... powers no decent wizard..."

A floorboard creaked out in the corridor and Dobby froze, his eyes bulging for a moment before he popped away. The elf had obviously been worried the footsteps belonged to one of his masters. Harry thought it much more likely that one of the other elves was simply doing their duty, but of course it was impossible to tell.

The only thing he knew was that he was thoroughly confused and very torn on whether or not to tell Mr. Malfoy exactly what had just transpired.

***Hours later...***

Harry had decided not to tell any of the Malfoys so long as Dobby didn't directly interfere in his affairs. Everything else that morning went smoothly and as planned; Harry found himself once more on the Hogwarts Express and unable to suppress an involuntary shudder.

The last time he had been on this train, he had been plucked straight off of it by a portkey given to him by one whom he had considered a friend. The prison which he had landed in no longer haunted his nightmares on a nightly basis, but it still crept up every now and then --- there was no unseeing the horrible sight he was made privy to.

Pansy was the last of Harry's group to enter the compartment, doing so just as the train began to glide out of Platform Nine and Three Quarters on the long trek to Hogwarts castle.

The sun shone brightly outside; a stark juxtaposition to the gloom of last year's first day of school. Harry watched it sparkle mesmerizingly off a lake as they began to enter less densely populated areas. He remembered from last year that they would soon spend a number of hours driving past large, open fields blanketed in vibrant fall colours that would only look all the more cheery when bathed in this beautiful sunlight. It was as if the summer was giving a final stand before quietly succumbing to the grasp of autumn and, eventually, winter.

"Any idea who this year's Defence professor is, Draco?"

Theodore's question drifted into Harry's ears, causing him to pull his head away from the window for the first time in a while. The conversation going on around him hadn't been overly stimulating and he found himself frequently spacing out. Probably because of the early hour at which he had been so unceremoniously awoken.

Draco cursed. "I knew I forgot to ask Father something." He looked at Harry. "I don't suppose *you* asked him?"

Harry had to resist the urge to raise an eyebrow. The emphasis the blond put on the word 'you' was odd. It was as if he spat it at Harry for reasons he couldn't entirely work out. Draco had actually been acting strangely ever since his birthday and particularly since their trip to the alleys. He had even sniped maliciously at Ron Weasley while Harry and Lucius had been getting their photos taken. Mr. Malfoy had fortunately led his son away before any real harm could come of the interaction, but Harry remembered hoping at the time that Draco might have blown off all of his steam while sniping at Weasley.

Clearly he hadn't and it had only grown worse since then. If they were alone, Harry might have called Draco out on it, but he didn't dare do so in public. These people had been Draco's friends before his, for one thing. Theodore had stuck with him during Harry and Draco's schism last year, but he wouldn't trust him to truly back Harry if conflict broke out.

"I didn't, no," he answered, trying to keep the coolness from his voice. Pansy's eyes narrowed a fraction but no one else reacted, so he supposed he must have at least been mildly successful.

Draco waved a hand. "There you go, then. I suppose we'll find out at the feast tonight. Let's just hope whoever the old man hired isn't completely useless."

"Or scum," muttered Theodore.

This thought brought Harry's mind back to the mudblood comment Tiberius Nott had made weeks ago at his manor and the inner conflict it had caused Harry. It had resulted in him doing a great deal of research into history.

One of the best things about the Malfoy family library was that it was not at all prone to being filled with censored material. The history books dotted around its ancient shelves were very much not the kind the ministry would approve of. According to Mr. Malfoy --- who had called the ministry-approved books 'censored trash' --- this was for the best.

Harry had learned a great deal from them. He had read about the witch burnings and the persecution witches and wizards faced while they'd lived in the open. Many of the worst accounts came from the Middle Ages, but they didn't stop there. The Statute of Secrecy had been signed the same year as the Salem Witch Trials had taken place, after all.

It had only reaffirmed everything he had known about muggles and made his hatred all the worse. Even more so after reading up on the Statute of Secrecy.

There was a large part of him that thought Grindelwald had a point, as much as that thought terrified him on a number of levels.

Why was it that the witches and wizards were the ones driven into hiding? They were born superior, born with powers the muggles could never hope to match. And they were just better. Harry had lived in both worlds and the magical one was just infinitely more interesting. It also didn't seem to suffer from many of the problems its muggle counterpart did. Sure, discrimination ran wild, but it didn't seem to lead to wars in the same way it did in the muggle world. There was of course Voldemort's war --- which was nowadays referred to as the Purity War --- but even that had encompassed only Magical Britain. Witches and wizards had never seen anything like either muggle world war --- even if Grindelwald had been a large part of the second. Though, to what extent his involvement stretched was a highly-debated topic.

Muggleborns themselves... that was more complicated.

Harry could sympathize with them, on one hand. None of what they were being judged so harshly for was their own fault.

Not to say that he didn't see the purebloods' point.

His readings about muggleborns in particular had been very complicated, but much of it dated back to the philosophy Salazar Slytherin seemed to have held. He was, after all, perhaps the most infamous blood supremacist of all time --- though Voldemort had been not-so-quietly giving him a worthy challenge in the past few decades.

Slytherin had lived in a time when tensions between muggles and wizards in Britain had been high. The books he had read about the man at Malfoy Manor spoke of him in a surprisingly favourable light. Mr. Malfoy had told him he'd had an interest in Slytherin from an early age and done his best to collect a large number of accurate, uncensored tomes about the man and his life.

Even in these, the details were blurry.

Most of them seemed to agree that Slytherin had feared a large-scale conflict between the muggles and the wizards. It wasn't that he'd had any doubt which side would win, but the two sides interacted so closely that a war would have been devastating on either side. Especially with magical education in its infancy. Most witches and wizards of that age were much less skilled than their modern day comparables since they had never truly been taught actual magic.

Slytherin saw the muggleborns as a link between the magical and muggle world. He was in favour of splitting the two worlds, even back then, and he viewed the feat as impossible; for so long as muggleborns were allowed entry into their world. He thought they would lead to the war he feared so greatly, hence his firm stance against their ability to attend Hogwarts.

That's what most of the books had said, anyway; though a few had cited that he had never wanted to even stop muggleborns attending Hogwarts.

This was about where any semblance of the books agreeing with each other ended.

Some painted him as a hero who sought the protection of the magical world. Others vilified him for going too far. Some said he had murdered, some said he had massacred, and some even spread a rumour about a fabled monster left at Hogwarts --- though Harry found this last tale to be more unlikely than all the rest.

He had also learned an interesting tidbit about Slytherin while reading these books which had made his heart stop and his blood run cold.

All of the books had made a massive fuss about Slytherin being able to speak to snakes. Harry had at first been confused by this. Once he had been made aware of the wizarding world, he had sort of just assumed everyone could do it. He had done it at the London zoo and even a few times in the gardens over the years, though he only even remembered some of those occasions after his most significant interaction of the serpentine variety.

Apparently, the ability was not at all one most magicals had. The books all claimed it was an ability of those who were descended from Salazar himself, one that was called Parseltongue. Harry hadn't thought the Potters shared any link to Slytherin. They weren't noted in any of the books he had found in the library discussing the history of the language. The last known speakers of the language had been the Gaunt family, who --- as far as Harry knew --- had no line of relation to his own family.

He had pondered whether or not he should ask Mr. Malfoy about the ability to speak to snakes, but he had decided against it. Many of these books painted it as something foul, certainly not something to be admired. Even the books that depicted Slytherin in a relatively favourable light didn't have great things to say about the ability. Its reputation had been tarnished over the years. With Slytherin's own reputation, that of his Hogwarts house, the Gaunt's well-publicized descent into deranged ruin, and the infamy of Voldemort, the language was nowadays viewed as an inherently dark ability.

Perhaps it was best if no one knew that Harry possessed it. Perhaps it was best if he just hid that ability away. It wasn't as though it could be of a great deal of use, could it?

He somehow doubted that hypothesis as his brain ran wild with potential usages. Much of the Slytherin common room was covered in serpentine decor. He knew much of the art of the wizarding world had the ability to become animated, so he wondered if the snakes in the common room or around the school would be prone to the same ability, too. He was sure there were other uses he was missing altogether, but that was the one which had filled his young, imaginative mind over the past couple of weeks.

"Personally," drawled Draco, "I don't much care who teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts so long as they know one end of a wand from another. I'm much more interested in everything else happening this year."

"Everything else?" Crabbe asked, leaning forward with curiosity. "What else is happening?"

Draco puffed out his chest. "*I'm* going to be playing seeker on the Slytherin Quidditch team."

Pansy squealed and began hastily congratulating him, but Theodore's eyes narrowed. "Confident, are we?"

Draco smirked. "It's not in doubt, Theodore. Father's bought brooms for the whole team. I've got mine already, of course." He glanced towards Harry with a strangely tight expression. "So does Harry. He'll be on the team too, naturally. Father's holding the rest of the brooms for now. The team will get them once Harry and I are officially selected."

Harry had been reluctant to go with that plan. Their final stop in Diagon Alley had been Quality Quidditch Supplies. The shopkeeper's jaw had nearly become detached from his face when Mr. Malfoy had purchased seven brand new Nimbus 2001s. He had said with no small amount of smugness that both Harry and Draco would get one and that the others would be used to ensure they made the Slytherin team.

Harry had felt torn about this. He wanted to play on the team and had planned on trying out for months. Cassius would have probably killed him if he didn't. He had been excited for the challenge though, to see just how good he really was next to his older, more experienced housemates.

It also just felt... wrong.

Harry could sympathize with all the rest of them because it hadn't been that long since he himself hadn't had any money of his own. The course of action made him feel unclean, but he eventually decided to go along with it. This was the cunning, Slytherin way, and it guaranteed results. Harry would just have to get over his moral compunctions.

Draco had seemed unhappy for a different reason. He had asked for a gift when his father had promised to buy Harry anything he wanted. Mr. Malfoy had acquiesced, which meant the boys were set to get one gift each. But when they had reached Quality Quidditch Supplies, the man had purchased Harry one of the brooms without a second thought. Harry wondered if that's what had made Draco start acting so strangely.

He had felt as though the boy was jealous for all these weeks but until now, he hadn't been able to work out exactly what he was jealous over. This was petty, but it did at least make some sense from Draco's perspective, even if it made Harry want to bang his head against a wall so hard that Dobby the house elf would have been proud.

Harry fingered the ornate ring he now wore. It had indeed turned out to be genuine and it had arrived at Malfoy Manor less than a week after their visit to Borgin and Burkes.

Draco seemed in a foul mood for the next couple of hours, right up until the trolley lady appeared in the doorway.

"Anything off the trolley, dears?"

They all scrambled to purchase sweets but when they were fully equipped, Draco didn't turn back towards their compartment.

He grinned maliciously after stuffing confections into his pockets. "What do you all say we find Weasley and have a bit of fun? He must feel like a bigshot now that his father got that stupid bill passed."

Harry had no interest in antagonizing Weasley. Every time he thought of the boy, he envisioned the broken figure being led away from Longbottom's grave. That image seemed to have permanently stained itself onto the inside of Harry's skull, but his friends were already moving to follow Draco.

Somebody touched his arm and Harry turned, meeting Pansy's brown eyes. "Are you okay, Harry?"

He shook himself. "I'm... yeah, just tired."

Pansy gave him a look. "You don't want to go bother Weasley, do you?"

Harry shrugged helplessly. "I just... don't really care. He's never done anything to me and I don't see the point."

"I don't much care either," she admitted. "It's probably going to put Draco in an even worse mood and I personally don\'t want to be around *that*. I was thinking about catching up with another friend of mine if you wanted to come too?"

Harry nodded gratefully. "Sure, who am I meeting? Or do I know them already?"

"Well, there will be more than just her in the compartment, but I'm mainly looking to catch up with Daphne. You know her, but I don't think the two of you talk much."

They didn't, but Harry did know who Pansy was talking about.

Daphne Greengrass --- Heiress of the Founding House of Greengrass --- was a tall, blonde girl with pale skin, angelic features, and icy blue eyes.

Harry's group of friends made up about half of the year, but Greengrass was also very popular and made up the other half. Harry hadn't had much to do with her, but he knew she was both incredibly intelligent and seemed to be quite charming. In the end-of-year rankings, Harry had topped the list in Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts, and Transfiguration. Greengrass had handily taken first in Astronomy, History of Magic, and Potions, leaving the deceased Neville Longbottom the top spot in Herbology. Greengrass had been second in Herbology and third in many other subjects, which had baffled Harry for some time. With the exception of Potions --- a class she seemed to be a legitimate prodigy in --- her practical work was nothing special. It wasn't bad and she was decent enough at Charms, but she wasn't one of the top few students in Slytherin, let alone the school.

After Harry's conversation with Flitwick in the library last December, he thought he understood. Perhaps her theoretical work was just so good that her average wand work didn't even hold her back all that much. If that was true, she probably scored higher than both Harry and Granger on the theory side of things. It was the only way he could rationalize her being so high in the rankings.

Greengrass was indeed not alone in her compartment, though she sat in the centre of one of the two booths. She was joined by who Harry recognized as Blaise Zabini, Millicent Bulstrode, Lily Moon, and Tracey Davis. Zabini was a tall, thin, athletic-looking boy with dark skin, intense dark brown eyes, and sharp features. Bulstrode was the largest student in their year not named Crabbe or Goyle. There were a few kids taller than her, but her bulk was truly impressive. Lillian Moon was a plain-looking girl with mousy brown hair and eyes of a similar colour, while Tracey was a pretty girl with very light brown hair and sea green eyes.

"What brings you two here?" asked Daphne once Harry and Pansy had taken their seats.

He sat right across from Greengrass. Her stare unnerved him. Those eyes seemed to penetrate him as if they were picking him apart and analyzing his inner workings.

"Draco being a twat," said Pansy.

Daphne rolled her eyes. "Ugh! What has the idiot gone and done this time?"

"Oh, nothing specific. He's just been a right gloomy prat the whole train ride. Harry and I took the chance to run when he was gonna go off after Weasley."

"I'll never understand what you see in him, Pansy. He's decent-looking and he has the family name, but that's about it. He doesn't seem to be overly interesting, and any conversation with him seems to have the words 'my father' crop up at least once."

Pansy hid a giggle behind her hand and even Harry's lips twitched. He really did like Draco, but Daphne wasn't terribly far off the mark.

"If I were him," said Tracey, "I'd talk about my father too. Maybe he thinks if he talks about him long enough, he might wake up one morning with daddy's hair."

This sent all the girls into peels of laughter and even Harry had to fight down his own amusement. It seemed wrong to openly laugh at someone mocking his best friend, but he had to admit, he liked Daphne and Tracey so far.

They all talked for a large part of the ride; except Zabini, who Harry couldn't remember saying as much as a word.

By the time he and Pansy left the compartment, night had arrived outside and they needed to change into their Hogwarts robes. As they made their way back towards their own compartment though, Harry's mind couldn't help but roam over all that had just happened.

Daphne Greengrass was pretty, popular, very charming, and naturally charismatic, but there was much more to her than that. He had an odd feeling that even her theoretical work at school didn't tell the whole story, as far as she was concerned.

***Some time later...***

Draco hadn't been at all pleased when Harry and Pansy had returned to the compartment. He had actually put up a bit of a fuss and it hadn't helped when Pansy had told him where they had been. Harry was more than happy to get off the train and was oddly grateful for the fact that a number of bodies separated him from Draco.

Last year, they had entered the castle after crossing the Black Lake in small, rickety boats; this year, they would be taking the carriages up to Hogwarts.

Harry shuddered at the sight of the skeletal horses pulling the carriages. They looked some sort of mythical creature dramatized in a muggle horror movie. He had been exceptionally confused by them last June.

*"They're called thestrals,"* Theodore had whispered to him quietly. Harry would never forget the look the boy gave him. It was more searching and evaluative than any stare Harry had ever seen. *"They can only be seen if you've watched someone die and were old enough to understand what happened."*

He wondered, even now, what on earth Theodore might have put together. Was it possible the boy had deduced that he had watched Neville die? Or perhaps he thought he'd seen the demise of their Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. It didn't really matter, he supposed, so long as he stayed quiet and didn't press Harry on the matter.

Harry's group of friends soon watched as Professor McGonagall led forth the new crop of first years. Harry recognized Ron Weasley's little sister from Flourish and Blotts. She was the second-to-last in the queue. The boy behind her looked oddly familiar to Harry as well, which was strange, because he was sure the two of them had never met.

The Sorting Hat sang a song which heralded a chorus of applause before it bowed to each of the tables and fell silent, prompting Professor McGonagall to begin calling the new first years forward.

Harry didn't pay much attention until a familiar name was called.

"Carrow, Flora!"

Carrow was a Sacred Twenty-Eight family and Harry remembered that two of the family's members were serving life sentences in Azkaban for their part in the Purity War.

"SLYTHERIN!"

That had been one of the faster sortings Harry could remember.

"Carrow, Hestia!"

Merlin, what was it with the magical world and twins? There were of course the infamous Weasley twins, the Patil twins from Harry's year, and now the Carrow twins? Given Hogwarts' relatively small population, it was strangely impressive --- especially considering Harry was sure he was missing a number of other pairs.

"SLYTHERIN!" the hat called just as quickly.

"Creevey, Colin!"

Harry felt a deep pang in his stomach as Colin Creevey scrambled unsteadily onto the stool. He reminded him painfully of Neville, even if he didn't have a family name like Longbottom behind him.

"GRYFFINDOR!"

The sorting continued, with only Benedict Cuffe, Natalie Farley, Alex Jugson, Martin Harper, Derrick Mulciber, and Rhea Rowle sorted into Slytherin.

"Weasley, Ginevra!"

Harry was sure Weasley would be an easy sorting, but the hat took longer with her than it had with any of the other new students this year. It did eventually proclaim her a Gryffindor and sent her off to the scarlet and gold table, but it hadn't been a swift affair.

"Yaxley, Cadmus!"

Bugger! That was why the boy had looked so familiar. His golden-blond hair, soft features, and sea-green eyes were terribly reminiscent of both his father's and older sister's. Harry had never even realized Cassie had a younger brother, but the likeness was obvious.

He was sorted into Slytherin almost as fast as the Carrows. By the time he had taken his seat with the other new Slytherins, Professor Dumbledore had taken to his feet, beaming at all of them as if nothing pleased him more than to see their faces whole and healthy.

"Welcome back!" he said. "Before I bore you with an old man's long-winded ramblings, I will allow you all to fill your long-desiring stomachs with some truly excellent food. Tuck in!"

Golden plates appeared in front of each student and heaping mounds of every kind of food imaginable were everywhere. The showcase didn't surprise Harry nearly as much as it had last year. Especially because now, he was pretty sure the house elves had just taken Dumbledore's cue.

He got about five minutes into his meal before he began to feel uncomfortable and wasn't sure why. It didn't take him long. Glancing around, he quickly realized that almost all of the first-year Slytherins were staring at him, though Cadmus Yaxley was doing so with a painful intensity.

He understood why they were curious, of course. The Boy-Who-Lived being sorted into Slytherin House had caused quite the uproar last year. It was of no surprise that their attention would be focused on him, but he wouldn't give the newbies the satisfaction of seeing him fidget. A year ago, he would have, but he was different now. He understood how Slytherin worked. It was all about power. He naturally had power over these students, being older and having more influential friends, but if he let them off put him so visibly on the first night, that balance would shift.

He met the stare of Cadmus Yaxley head-on, not so much as blinking until the younger boy looked away. He then gazed at all of the others in turn, raising a single eyebrow and asking a silent question.

They all went back to their food and he heaved an internal sigh. Merlin, Slytherin was exhausting sometimes.

Before he knew it, the dessert plates were clearing off --- much to the chagrin of both Crabbe and Goyle --- and Dumbledore had taken to his feet once more.

"Another year begins," he said happily, "but not before I make you all aware of a few start-of-term formalities.

"Mr. Filch has once again asked me to remind you all that magic is not to be performed in the corridors. He has insisted that infractions of this rule will be treated extra harshly this year." He smiled. "The same message goes for an impressive list of things pinned to the door of his office. You can view them all at any time for your collective reading pleasure."

Harry wasn't sure if he was imagining the amused twinkle in the old man's eyes, but he hoped he wasn't. It was so much more entertaining if it really was there.

"In case the bright new minds of today fail to ascertain as much from the name, first years should note that the Forbidden Forest is not to be entered under any circumstances.

"Quidditch trials will be held some time after the first week of classes. Please see your heads of house if you are a second year or above who is at all interested.

"And finally, the long-standing tradition of staffing additions continues. This year, I am especially excited for the occasion. It is my pleasure to welcome my very own brother, Aberforth, into the castle. He is most graciously taking up the position of Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor, and I cannot wait to hear all about his lessons. He is most unfortunately under the weather and will not arrive until tomorrow morning."

That... had not been expected.

The roar of noise that swept through the Great Hall was evidence of that. They'd had some fun throwing out wild theories during dinner, but with no new teacher present at the staff table, they hadn't had anything to go off of.

"It's even worse than I thought," huffed Draco. "He's bringing in his own brother to teach!" He sneered. "One Dumbledore was already doing enough damage to this place, two of them might ruin it."

Pansy was just giggling. "Aberforth Dumbledore," she managed to squeak out. "Isn't he the one who got caught for using illegal charms on goats?"

"Charming fellow, isn't he?" asked Daphne as she passed them on their way out of the hall. "I can't wait to learn all about magical creatures from an expert like him."

This proved too much for Pansy, who nearly fell over as she was laughing so hard at this point.

Harry wasn't laughing.

He was thinking that, yet again, it seemed like he was in for an interesting year at Hogwarts.

***The Great Hall***

***8:20 AM***

The morning after all the students arrived back at Hogwarts shared none of the vibrancy of the one before. The clouds were thick and grey, veiling the world in a dull sort of light. The gloomy weather threatened to sour the generally jovial atmosphere in the Great Hall that first morning back at Hogwarts, but none seemed to care. It appeared that the thrill of being back at such a magical place overrode the dreariness of the enchanted ceiling above.

Harry had been the first of his friends awake, though he hadn't actually gone to the library. He had taken a number of books from the Malfoy family library to Hogwarts and he had spent the morning pouring over them in the dormitory before the rest of his friends rose from their slumbers.

They had needed to wait especially for Pansy, who looked somewhat like a rigid corpse despite all the effort she had clearly put in to avoid that exact visage.

"Is that even healthy?" Harry asked, watching the copious amounts of coffee stream like a waterfall into Pansy's mug.

"I don't care," she mumbled. "I need it."

"What had you up so late?" Draco asked.

"Was watching first years."

Theodore smirked. "Speak up, Pansy, dear. We couldn't hear you."

She glared at him. "I was watching the new first years."

"Why?" asked Harry.

"Networking," she said tersely.

"Did you... uh, see anything interesting?"

"I did, actually. The prefects gave them a talking-to, like normal, but they actually gave them things."

"What sort of things?"

"That's the thing, I don't actually know. Each of the first years just got bags. I never actually got to see what was in them."

"Odd," said Theodore, "Yaxley and Warrington wouldn't have struck me as the type to hand out presents."

Cassandra and Cassius were the new fifth-year prefects. Harry found himself quite happy with the fact. That was now one-third of the Slytherin prefects who he could call friends. Hopefully, it would be enough to curb any potential antagonizers from the upper years.

Pansy just shrugged. "It could have been one of the older prefect's ideas. Either way, it doesn't matter; I just want to know what they got."

"A bit odd they would do it this year," said Harry. "We never got anything like that. Do any of you know if this has happened in the last few years?"

"Not sure," Pansy said with a gleam in her eyes, "but I plan on finding out."

Draco rolled his eyes. "Of course you do."

Timetables came in the minutes to follow when their Head of House, Professor Snape, made his way down the table and distributed the sheets of parchment. For second years, it was the exact same schedule they had used last year. From what Harry could tell, their timetable last year hadn't been a generic first-year schedule, but one specifically designed for those entering Hogwarts in the 1991-92 school year. It would be their timetable until the end of school; it would just become more complicated next year, when extra classes would enter the equation.

When Snape dropped Harry's timetable in front of him, he expected to be ignored altogether, but the Potions Master surprised him.

Their eyes met and Harry almost shivered. The man's glare was impressive; Harry had thought such venomous stares from Snape were reserved for the Gryffindors. It looked as though Harry had personally offended him. If he didn't know better, he might have thought he was seeing very real anger in the man's eyes. Their eye contact was broken soon after and Snape stormed off to distribute the new first-year timetables.

Harry watched him go with a pensive expression. He wasn't sure what he had done to Snape, but he wondered if this year he might actually grow to envy the way Snape had ignored him the entirety of the last.

***September 3, 1992***

***The Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom***

***10:40 AM***

The first day of classes had been uneventful. The most consequential of their lessons had been their double period with Professor McGonagall for Transfiguration, but the class had served as mostly a review of last year's material and a test of whether or not the students had actually done the summer reading.

Harry performed all the tasks with little effort and Theodore did quite well. Draco and Pansy were both less successful since Transfiguration had never been among their strengths. Crabbe and Goyle's performances were better left unspoken of.

Harry had actually practiced some Transfiguration over the summer. The limited amount he could, at least. He really just worked on his own method of visualization --- which had worked for him so well the previous year --- but largely, he had been reading up on the theory. Its theoretical component was the most difficult of all his classes, in Harry's opinion, so it was something he had been desperate to get ahead in. Over the holidays, he had learned that he actually enjoyed the subject more than he had realized and had actually gotten further ahead than he'd expected --- though he didn't plan to slow down. It was easily his second favourite class after Defence Against the Dark Arts and Harry wondered just how far ahead he might be able to get in both.

Speaking of Defence Against the Dark Arts, it was their second period class that next morning. The general mood among the Slytherins seemed to be one of trepidation. A number of them harboured inherent grudges against Dumbledore, so the news of his brother's hiring had not pleased a great many of them. Harry actually found himself cautiously optimistic. He knew that Aberforth would never hold a candle to his more talented brother, but he had a hard time believing that the brother of Albus Dumbledore would be incompetent.

Every member of the class was seated minutes before the bell had rung. Their professor had not yet arrived, so Harry let his eyes roam over their classroom. Last year, it had been bedecked in what would have been decor reflective of Professor Quirrell had his body not been leeched off of by Voldemort. Dark drapes had covered the windows and the room had been lit with only ominous, magical lighting. Incense had burned all around the room --- supposedly in an unsuccessful bid to cover the smell of garlic. If Harry had to guess now, he would assume the failure on that front was intentional, seeing as it had not been Quirrell at all.

This year, their new professor had chosen to be much less expressive.

The windows were once again veiled, though this time they were obscured not by dark drapes but by very worn-looking curtains. The walls themselves were completely bare, except for a large number of torches dotted sporadically throughout the room, casting shadows across many of the gathered faces.

Their desks were lined up in simple rows one behind the other. Harry made straight for the back of the room, as was customary for him, and none of his friends had any hesitation following. Draco and Theodore, in particular, were among those most concerned by the identity of their professor.

The bell rang out before their professor entered the room. Two minutes later, the class had begun to grow impatient. Draco seemed especially agitated as he scowled and threw the occasional glare towards the door.

About a minute and a half later, the blond turned to do so again, only for the classroom's lone entrance to fly open with a loud *BANG* and for Draco to very quickly force his face blank.

The man who stepped into the room wore grey robes that clearly looked as though they had seen better days. They were frayed around the edges and Harry thought the seams looked as though they might split at any moment. His long, grey hair was stringy and looked unkempt, as did his beard of the same colour. Harry thought his eyes might have been every bit as blue as his brother's, but it was hard to tell, for his glasses were coated in a thick layer of dust, grime, or... something.

It was an odd dichotomy, comparing Albus to Aberforth. Albus Dumbledore's pearly silver hair and beard only added to his usually lurid robes to form an image of a grand old man who was completely and totally in control at all times. Aberforth appeared much the opposite. His grey hair did not look grand, but weathered, and his robes gave the impression of a man who had been through many hard times. It was a startling juxtaposition, but it got Harry's attention almost at once.

"Welcome to Defence Against the Dark Arts and all the rest." The man's voice was gruff and a bit raspy. It gave the impression of heavy disuse. "I'm not going to spend time explaining what this class is about. If you've spent a year in the damn thing and haven't figured that much out yet, it's your own fault and not worth my time. I won't bother talking about myself, either. I don't want to, and I'm sure my dear brother has already said more than enough."

The class stared. They had never had a professor like this. All who had taught them so far had been very standard in their approach. Quirrell... or Voldemort --- Merlin, Harry hated that thought --- had been the least of them, but even he had spoken eloquently and with great care. Aberforth seemed to care neither for them nor what they thought of him. It was refreshing, in a strange sort of way --- if a bit off-putting.

"Last year, I've been told you covered the basics. You learned what separates a jinx from a hex, and a hex from a curse. You learned some basic spells to keep you safe in a tie-up and you practiced the necessities; dodging, aiming, so on, so forth. Am I correct?" The class nodded. Aberforth's expression looked oddly blank before he spoke again. "Good; turns out the stutterbox wasn't a complete waste of everyone's time."

A number of Harry's classmates whispered to each other and seemed confused by the way this man spoke of Quirrell.

Harry had never thought much on it, but his brain put the pieces together.

Quirrell had been a stuttering mess when they had crossed paths in the Leaky Cauldron, but he had been quite the opposite in class. It was obvious the stuttering had been an act. The way Professor Dumbledore specified that Quirrell wasn't a waste of everyone's time and called him a stutterbox made Harry think that the man had kept his act up around all who were not Slytherins. It was a risky move on the man's part, but it hadn't backfired. Then again, Voldemort had supposedly been a Slytherin long ago. He likely knew the house wasn't about to oust the best Defence Against the Dark Arts professor they'd had in years.

"This year," Aberforth continued, "we'll be building on that. You won't be learning a ton of new spells in this class; that's not until fourth year --- apparently. I think it's rubbish, but I don't write the syllabus, so take it up with the ministry. We'll be covering how your other subjects can tie into my class, and we'll be making sure you know how to react to situations. You can't all be high and mighty like my hero of a brother. Walking into a fight with your wand at the ready doesn't work for everyone. There are right and wrong ways to do it."

This actually sounded interesting to Harry, though he feared he might grow bored with it. Yaxley had him thinking through scenarios each week over the summer, so he was quite far ahead in this department already.

"But first," said the professor, "let's review a very important trick you all worked on last year, shall we?" His eyes scanned the room. "Malfoy!" he barked, making Draco flinch. "Up here, now."

Draco looked like he might protest until he looked up and spotted the expression on their professor's face. It was extremely stern-looking and certainly did not give off the impression that disobedience would be tolerated. There was also something else in the old man's eyes. Something Harry couldn't identify.

Draco hastened to stand and scrambled up to the front of the room. "Face me!" their professor demanded, and Draco did so. "Good, now --- Dolor!"

Draco yelped as the old man's Stinging Hex struck him square in the chest and a follow-up grazed his shoulder.

The class held their breath.

"What are you doing, you batty old man!?" Draco demanded.

"Teaching," was the only answer Aberforth gave before firing off another two Stinging Hexes. Draco dodged these and started glaring. "Well, would you look at that? He does remember how to dodge. Let's make things more interesting then, shall we?"

By more interesting, he meant firing spells at Draco much faster and, occasionally, without incanting. They were mercifully all Stinging Hexes, but he had Draco at it for quite some time. By the time he was done, the boy limped back to his seat and when the bell rang at the end of the class, the stream of expletives flowing from Draco's mouth was truly something to behold.

Harry, for his part, wasn't sure what to think. The man had been a decent instructor once he had finished making an example of Draco, but that had been... unexpected.

Really, the whole thing had been. Harry wasn't sure what exactly he had expected, but it most certainly had not been that.

***September 4, 1992***

***The Potions Classroom***

***9:10 AM***

Draco hadn't stopped complaining about their first lesson in Defence Against the Dark Arts for the rest of the day. Harry couldn't decide whether to laugh or be annoyed. He could understand why Draco was upset, but did he really have to remind them and anyone else who would listen about it every thirty seconds? Some of the older students had been much less impressed and had let Draco have it vocally --- which had only provoked him into an even greater temper.

His mood had not passed by the time the next morning came around and as the second-year Slytherins entered the Potions classroom, Harry wondered whether or not he even wanted to be paired with Draco right now.

Not that it mattered.

"I think not, Potter," drawled Snape when Harry made to sit down beside Draco. "You will be partnering with Crabbe for the foreseeable future. Maybe then you won't be able to rely on the ability of your partner. This way, you might actually gain something beyond a mere shred of adequacy in the subject."

Harry seethed as he moved his things beside Crabbe. He liked the larger boy, even when he was quiet. He wasn't the fastest broom of the bunch, but he was loyal and when he did actually speak, he occasionally had a bit of humour up his sleeve.

"Sorry," the boy muttered, looking down at the desk as though he had caused the whole ordeal. He obviously knew Harry wasn't pleased to be brewing with him; not with the sheer number of times he had somehow managed to melt cauldrons the year before.

"It's not your fault," Harry muttered, presently locked in a staring contest with Snape. The man seemed to watch for any outward reaction, but Harry gave him nothing despite the way the Gryffindors snickered on the other side of the room.

He had no idea what he had done to Snape in the first place to warrant being completely ignored while he showered anyone else in the house who so much as breathed with points for the most innocuous of things. That had been surprisingly disheartening at first, but Harry had grown accustomed to it over the course of his first year.

But this... this was an entirely different level of malice. He could deal with it, but it confused him. He understood why the Dursleys disliked him. They were muggles and feared him for his magic, feared him for so many oddities they could never hope to understand. It did not at all excuse their actions, nor did it make Harry any more inclined to forgive them, but at least he understood.

The way Snape had gone out of his way to antagonize Harry and make his life more difficult for no apparent reason... that didn't make sense.

Draco didn't look pleased either, but Snape was paying neither of them any mind now. He had spun on his heel and silenced the still-snickering Gryffindors with a glare.

"Weasley!" he snapped. "What is the name and appearance of the most powerful truth potion our world has ever seen?"

The boy flushed. "I don't know," he gritted out.

Harry had nearly jumped out of his seat.

Truth potion?

The wizarding world had *truth potions?*

He actually shuddered, drawing a concerned look from Crabbe that he waved off. First mind reading and now truth potions? What the hell had he gotten himself into?

Snape's lip curled. "Finnigan," he next called upon, "what is Polyjuice Potion and why is it illegal?"

Seamus Finnigan flushed deeply. "I dunno."

"Speak up, Finnigan, I can't hear you."

"I said I don't know, sir."

"I see." Hermione Granger looked fit to burst. She was looking at Snape with wide, puppy-dog eyes as if begging to be called upon. "Are you impatient, Granger?" asked Snape. "Are my questions perhaps so easy you are just bursting to earn your house so much as a point?"

The bushy-haired Gryffindor was frantically shaking her head, but Snape was having none of it. "Very well, Granger. What is the potion which gives off the most alluring smell to whoever falls under its power?"

Hermione deflated, clearly not knowing the answer.

Snape tutted. "Pathetic, all of you. The most powerful truth serum in the world is Veritaserum. It is a colourless, odourless liquid, which makes it ideal for subtle use. Polyjuice Potion is illegal because it allows one person to take on the exact appearance of another. I doubt even any of you are thickheaded enough to miss the potential implications of such a potion." He sneered at Hermione. "For your information, Granger, the potion I was referring to was Amortentia. It is the most powerful love potion in the world. Remember that; I fear you may need to make use of it in the future.

"Now," the man continued, ignoring the stricken look on Hermione Granger's face, "turn to page one hundred and ninety-seven in your textbooks and we will begin."

Harry immediately realized there had been some truth to what Snape had said. His potion-brewing abilities had clearly lagged very far behind his wandwork. He was competent on his own, he thought, but he wasn't quite good enough to prevent Crabbe from melting his cauldron. Not that many people would have been. Well, Greengrass would have --- she submitted her and Davis's potion about twenty minutes before the next person was done --- but she was an exception. An incredibly irritating one right now, at that.

Harry and Crabbe had been doing well until the latter had added double the fluxweed they had needed...

Snape did not take points from them, but his sneer said a thousand words.

Harry was more than a bit bitter by the time he and his friends left the class. Pansy was rattling on about how unfair Snape had been to Harry, which was both considerate and insensitive all at once, since Crabbe was standing awkwardly off to her side. Her platitudes meant nothing to Harry, so Theodore tried a slightly less conventional method.

"Cheer up, Harry. It's a Friday, remember?" He looked blankly back at him, as if asking what was his point. Theodore grinned. "Spell practice! I've learned some things over the summer. Maybe a mock duel or two could be interesting, while we're at it."

***September 6, 1992***

***The Entrance Hall***

***4:13 PM***

Theodore had regretted his words that night. The gap in skill between the two of them had been very obvious by the end of last year, but it had grown by leaps and bounds over the summer and now more accurately resembled a vast and gaping chasm. Theodore might have learned some new spells, but Harry had learned many more thanks to the books in the Malfoy family library and the one Diana had given him for his birthday. He had probably just spent more time reading than Theodore and he had always been able to master spells much faster than anyone else he knew.

There was also the fact he had spent the second half of his summer being tutored by Corban Yaxley. Not only did he come from a long line of duellists, but he had spent a number of years on the professional circuit after graduating from Hogwarts. From what Harry had ascertained, it was a Yaxley family tradition. His skill had grown by untold margins too large to measure during those lessons, and beating Theodore now seemed almost boring.

The first day of the weekend had come and Harry had actually spent much of it reading. A great deal of it had been spent away from his friends in the library. He wasn't sure what was going on with Draco, but he had known he'd needed a break from it. When he wasn't in the library, he had been sitting with his friends near the fire --- even then the book on curses from Diana had been in his hands.

That had been yesterday.

It was now the next afternoon and Harry trudged back up towards the castle side by side with Cassius. He knew he ought to feel like he had just received the Order of Merlin after his incredible first performance on a Quidditch pitch, but he couldn't.

Not with the way Draco had stormed off in a raging temper, ignoring his calls as he went.

***Earlier that day...***

Sunday morning dawned bright, and sunlight blessed them with its presence for the first time since their journey to Hogwarts. It was not a warm, glowing sun, but a deceptive one full of mischief; for it only lured those out into its light and exposed them to surprisingly frigid air. It was a clear indication that the warm weather would not last forever, and to Harry, it seemed like a reminder that winter was eventually on its way.

What made the brisk temperatures and bitter winds all the worse was that Slytherin was holding their Quidditch tryouts that day. Draco complained loudly about this as he and Harry made their way out across the sloping lawns and down towards the surprisingly empty Quidditch stadium. Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team captain, had promised no spectators would be allowed in the stadium. It would give away the fact they were sporting Nimbus 2001s, and that was an advantage Flint wasn't high on losing.

"It's still ridiculous," Draco said for the hundredth time. "We're already on the team; Father made sure of that. Just give me seeker, you chaser, and be done with it."

It turned out Marcus Flint had other ideas.

"What do you mean we have to tryout?" Draco hissed at the older boy in a fury. "My Father---"

"Said he would give us all the brooms if you and Potter got on the team. Yes, Malfoy, I know; now shut the fuck up and listen!" Draco shut his mouth with the look of someone who had just swallowed an especially sour lemon. "Both you and Potter are on the team. I don't know if you can fly nearly as well as you think you can, but Warrington vouches for Potter, and I trust his judgement. Even if neither of you could outfly a sack of shit, I want those brooms too badly."

"Then---"

"I said shut it, Malfoy. Your Father never said I couldn't put you through the wringer --- don't tempt me." Again, Draco fell quiet. "Another thing he never said was that you had to be seeker, or chaser, or whatever."

Flint grinned in a malicious sort of way. "Neither of you can play beater --- scrawny as a wand, the both of you --- and Bletchley's too good a keeper to lose. Montague's a decent chaser, but he can get stuffed if it means we get those brooms." His eyes gleamed. "But we do have a position open for seeker. I hate to break it to you, Malfoy, but it's the most important position in Quidditch. I'm gonna make damn sure I pick the right person for that job and if half of what Warrington says about Potter is right, I'm not sure you're it.

"Now," he snapped, "up in the air, the both of you!"

***Back in the present...***

"I just don't get it," said Harry, kicking at a stray stone right before they crossed the threshold and re-entered the castle proper. "What did I do to him? What have I ever done to him?"

Harry and Draco had both competed against one another in a number of seeker drills, and the outcome hadn't been terribly close.

It became obvious quite quickly to those who didn't know Draco that he had indeed not exaggerated his abilities on a broom. He actually would have made quite a good seeker on most teams, but it was just as obvious from the beginning that he was not going to be filling the position for Slytherin.

Harry had a natural grace that Draco couldn't match and he was also just much more daring --- a surprisingly valuable trait for a seeker. Draco had performed well and by no means had he embarrassed himself, but he had never really stood a chance.

When the decision had been made, Draco had stormed away and nothing Harry could say had snapped him out of the mood.

"You beat him," Cassius answered simply. "Sometimes, that's all it takes."

"It isn't just that, though," Harry insisted. "He's been weird like this for a while. Ever since my birthday."

Cassius's brow furrowed. "What happened on your birthday?" Harry shrugged helplessly, unsure as to where any of this had come from. "Look, Harry, don't worry about it, all right? It'll be fine. Malfoy just needs to swallow his pride, grow a pair, and get over it. Once he does that, all should be fine."

Harry hoped Cassius was right, but a sinking part of him doubted the truth of his words.

They made idle small talk all the way down the stone steps leading into the dungeons, passed the serpentine decor of a corridor Harry had always thought existed simply to misdirect the other houses, and into the Slytherin common room itself.

"Cassius, Harry, come here."

It took Harry a moment to register the voice, but he had heard it enough to remember.

"Afternoon, Cassie," said Cassius, slumping down on the couch between her and Diana.

The female prefect gestured for Harry to take a seat on her other side, and it was he who she turned to first. "How did Quidditch pan out?"

They talked for quite some time, but eventually Cassie had to leave for her rounds as a prefect. As she stood, Harry felt something brush up against him. He wouldn't realize until later that she had smoothly slipped a note of parchment into the pocket of his robes.

***September 10, 1992***

***Severus Snape's Office***

***8:00 PM***

Much to Harry's relief, Cassius had actually been right in his assessment of Draco. The two of them began interacting again as normal the Tuesday after their scrum on the Quidditch pitch. Draco never apologized, nor did he mention the two days of forced separation. He seemed to treat the whole thing like it had never happened and Harry was more than willing to do the same in return. Pansy's eyes cut between them for most of the day as if she were expecting something to happen again.

Cassie's note had come with the promise of duelling lessons, as her father had told Harry would be the case, but there was no schedule set. She requested he write her with a few times that would work and then she would get back to him with the final time.

That had been the last significant event --- barring his make-up with Draco --- that had happened until tonight.

The entire Quidditch team had received missives that morning at breakfast requesting their presence in Snape's office that evening. After the way the man had treated him in Potions, Harry could not say he was at all looking forward to the event, but he trudged along with Draco nevertheless.

It was the first time Harry had been in the office belonging to his Head of House and he personally could have done without the experience.

Snape's office was dark and looked to Harry more like a cave housing some sort of horror-film monster than a place where his Head of House might mark essays. The room was dimly lit and had a sinister feel. The walls were cloaked so deeply in shadows that Harry wondered whether or not they were enchanted. Shelves bore vials of all sorts of repulsive things: animal intestines, bits of terrifying, magical plants, and even what appeared to Harry like a human brain, just to name a few. Around these shelves floated different vials containing actual potions. Their varying colours were the brightest light in the room.

Snape gave all members of the team not named Harry Potter or Draco Malfoy their Nimbus 2001s, urged them to write letters of gratitude to Mr. Malfoy, and gave them what was perhaps meant to be an encouraging speech about the glory of Slytherin house and the lofty standards that must be upheld. It came off more threatening than inspiring, in Harry's opinion, but time would only tell whether or not it would work.

"Potter!" called Snape as they all made their way towards the room's exit. "Stay behind!"

Draco shot a questioning look over his shoulder, but Harry shook his head. He had no idea what Snape wanted, nor how long it would take. Plus, Draco had not been pleased the last time Snape had interfered with Harry, since he had, in a sense, gotten caught in the crossfire. Given how fragile their friendship still felt, Harry thought that outright avoidance of a potential repeat was probably the best course of action he could take.

"You wanted to speak with me, sir?" Harry asked once the rest of the team had filed out of the room.

Snape scowled. "Do not overinflate your own importance, Potter. The rest of the staff may fawn over you because of a fluke many years ago, but I do not and will never hold you in such a lofty regard." The man reached a hand into the pocket of his robes and withdrew a sealed scroll of parchment. "A message from the Headmaster," said Snape. "Now, be gone, since I most certainly do not wish to speak with you."

Harry left the room with a great sigh. Snape's behaviour was going to be quite vexing if it continued, but he pushed it from his mind, far more interested in the parchment he had been given.

*Dear Harry,*

*I thought it only right I allow you to settle in before disturbing your already full schedule. Especially now, with a Quidditch position I offer the sincerest of congratulations for.*

*If you are still eager, we will begin our planned lessons next Friday, on the 18th of September, at 8:00 in the evening.*

*If this time is for some reason inconvenient to you, please write back at once.*

*Yours truly,*

*Albus Dumbledore*

*P.S. I adore sherbet lemons.*

Harry grinned ear to ear, thankful no one was in the corridor to see him now. He had no idea what the last bit meant, but he was beyond excited. Finally, he would get to learn Occlumency, and from Albus Dumbledore, of all people.

***September 13, 1992***

***The Quidditch Pitch***

***7:12 AM***

Sunday morning blossomed much like the one before, with streaming bright sunlight and vivid blue skies. The difference was that the air was more favourable. Instead of its frigid bite from the previous week, the seven robed figures making their way down towards the Quidditch pitch felt only its warm and gentle caress. A soft breeze blew across the land and the smallest of the procession thought the pleasant gusts of wind may have felt like slender fingers running through his dark, messy hair. Not that he had experience with such sensations, but it was a nice thought.

"The hell?" asked Derrick --- one of the beaters --- gesturing in front of them.

Up ahead, the Quidditch stadium loomed with the sun only just poking out over the highest of its seats. It was as pristine as ever, but it was not the stadium itself that had drawn the beater's attention.

Far above the highest rows of benches, figures flew through the sky like scarlet-clad comets. Except for one of them, perched high atop his broom and standing guard over a towering set of hoops, the group resembled crimson blurs as they rocketed around the pitch. Their laughter carried in the early morning breeze. In the absence of any other noise, it reached the ears of the seven figures adorned in green and silver robes; each of them carrying their own broomsticks, set on occupying the same pitch that was now in use.

Marcus Flint cursed. "I'll kill the lot of them; Snape booked us the pitch special! When I get my hands on Wood, Gryffindor might be without a keeper!"

Given the sheer size and impressive musculature of Flint, Harry thought there really was an outside chance that might be the case if he truly did snap.

Soon enough, they all poured onto the pitch, drawing mutters from members of all four houses who were gathered in the stands. It looked like some sort of staged invasion to many of the onlookers. The Gryffindor team must have thought something similar, for a number of bodies hurtled towards the ground almost at once."

"Flint!" Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. "This is our practice time! You can clear off now!"

Flint's eyes sparkled with malice in the early morning sunlight. "Plenty of room for all of us, Wood."

The three Gryffindor chasers and the youngest Weasley had landed now, joining their captain and beaters. Johnson, Spinnet, and Bell looked oddly out of place in front of the Slytherin team, all of whom but Harry and Draco were towering males in at least their fourth year.

The Slytherins all stood shoulder to shoulder in front of Harry and Draco, completely casting the two second years in their shadow. Harry actually smirked. Shock factor was a wonderful advantage if it was used correctly.

"But I booked the field!" shouted Wood, positively spitting with rage. "I booked it!"

Ah," said Flint, "but I've got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape." Flint produced a scroll of parchment from his robes with a flourish and cleared his throat theatrically, like a muggle director calling for quiet on the set. "*'I, Professor S. Snape,* *give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their two newest members.*'"

"You've got new members?" Wood asked sharply, clearly distracted. "Where?"

Draco winked at Harry, plastered a broad smirk upon his face, and stepped out from behind the five large figures. His pale skin seemed to glow in the sunlight which sparkled off his platinum-blond hair --- not unlike it did the dew on still-wet grass --- seeming to make it shine unnaturally. The image was really quite ethereal in its aesthetic and Harry had to admit that Draco had a gift for dramatic flair.

"Aren't you Lucius Malfoy's son?" asked one of the Weasley twins, looking at Malfoy with dislike and completely ruining the holier-than-thou image Draco had managed to naturally conjure.

"Funny you should mention Draco's father," said Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. "Let me show you the generous gift he's made to the Slytherin team."

As one, the Slytherins --- minus Harry, who was still obscured by the others --- raised their left arms, all of which held pristine Nimbus 2001s. If the sunlight had sparkled off of Draco's hair, it positively danced across the golden label of the brooms, and the ostentatious lettering seemed to dance in dazzling ways.

"Very latest model. Only came out last month," said Flint carelessly, flicking an imaginary speck of dust from the end of his own. "I believe it outstrips the old 2000 series by a considerable amount. As for the old Cleansweeps," he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives, "sweeps the board with them."

None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment. Ron Weasley was opening his mouth and then closing it repeatedly, looking like a fish out of water as he stared in transfixed horror at Draco Malfoy, who was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits.

"What's the matter?" asked Cassius, feigning concern. "No reaction? Are our brooms not impressive enough for you?" He sighed. "Oh well, maybe our *other* new teammate will do the trick."

Recognizing his cue, Harry took his own turn to step out into the light, maintaining a blank expression as he stared at each of the Gryffindors in turn. His appearance actually drew gasps from the three chasers and Ron Weasley looked as though he might faint.

"Oh, come now," Cassius said. "You don't like your golden boy anymore now that he's wearing green and silver? Such chivalrous loyalty, that."

"Oh, look," pointed out Miles Bletchley, "there seems to be a field invasion."

Slytherins and Gryffindors alike were flooding the pitch now. Granger rushed to Weasley's side and frantically asked what was going on, while Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Theodore joined the Slytherins' ranks, having been made aware of the early morning practice by both Harry and Draco.

Weasley had obviously said something about the brooms because Granger's eyes had practically bulged out of her head.

"Just noticing now, Weasley?" Draco asked in a bored, detached-sounding voice, holding his broom up to the light before shrugging. "Don't feel too jealous. I'm sure the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid for them."

The Slytherins howled with laughter. Harry feigned a smile; laughing at the financial misfortunes of others hit a bit too deeply after ten years of being little more than a prisoner.

Granger bristled and stepped forward. "At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent."

The smug look on Draco's face flickered. "No one asked your opinion, you filthy little mudblood!"

Harry knew all hell was going to break loose a second before it happened.

A number of Gryffindors fired spells at Draco all at once. Flint tackled Draco to the ground, which was fortunate because Ron Weasley's spell sailed right through the space the blond had occupied not seconds earlier...

And smacked straight into the face of Pansy Parkinson.

Everyone seemed to freeze as the girl's mouth opened wide and let out a horrible scream before slugs began pouring from her mouth by the dozen. People screamed, one or two vomited, but Harry just saw red. He forgot all about the reason the fight had been started, forgot about how he held no dislike for Ron Weasley, and even that Pansy hadn't been his desired target.

Harry's wand came up, seemingly of its own volition.

"Diffindo!"

The Cutting Curse was not yet one they had learned. Judging by what Harry had heard about the Defence Against the Dark Arts curriculum, it would probably be covered in fourth year. He had read about it --- in the book of curses Diana had sent him for his birthday --- though this was the first time he was trying it.

Weasley let out a cry of pain as a spray of crimson flowed from the wound now etched upon his skin. Harry's aim had been true and the spell had severed his lip, leaving part of it hanging and causing blood to stream from it like a grotesque waterfall.

Wands were drawn everywhere and Harry threw himself to the side as jets of light shot towards him from all angles. The Slytherins were retaliating now and it was complete and total bedlam. Some people fell to spellfire, others tripped over housemates as they tried to flee, and some spells just collided in mid-air, ricocheting and reflecting off of one another at terrifyingly unpredictable angles.

"AERIA IMPULSUM!"

There was an unnaturally loud *WOOSH* from somewhere behind them as something flew above their heads.

Then...

*BANG!*

It was like a thunderbolt had tumbled from the heavens, bringing with it a blinding flash of silver lightning that left everyone on the Quidditch pitch blinking stars from their vision.

Or perhaps that was the wall of concussive force that had slammed into the pitch, sending every last battling student sprawling, many of their wands tumbling from their grasps.

Groans could be heard as many students pushed themselves up onto all fours. Harry was among them. He had no idea what to expect but yet again, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor surprised him.

"All of you, off the pitch, now!" shouted Aberforth Dumbledore, glaring at all of them. "No arguments!" he bellowed when some students made to protest. "I don't give a goat's bollocks who started it; I'm finishing it. I'll investigate and hand out punishments later. For now, get the hell off this pitch before I cast something else!"

That got everyone moving. Nobody wanted to know how the man would follow that up.

"Did you see that?" Harry heard some students muttering.

"What the fuck was that spell?" an upper-year asked with bated breath.

Harry did not care.

Coherent thought had returned to him and suddenly, he remembered exactly how Pansy had gotten in the position she had and exactly who had started everything.

"What the hell were you thinking!" Harry stormed at Draco as soon as they entered the changing room.

All of the other team members paused and looked curiously upon the two flushing second years.

"What was *I* doing?" Draco asked. "You just stood there and let Weasley curse me!"

"How was I supposed to know you were going to goad the Gryffindors like a complete idiot?"

"What did you just call me?"

"Exactly what you were. We were probably outnumbered two to one; why the hell would you start a fight?" Draco was blushing deeply, but he didn't seem to have a worthy answer. "Exactly! There's no reason. Yeah, let's just use one of the most hated words in the magical world in front of a bunch of Gryffindors. Not like their house is known for chivalry or anything. I'm sure they'll take it just great---"

"Shut up!" hissed Draco, instinctually drawing his wand. Harry flicked his own wrist and summoned his from its holster. It slammed into his palm with a satisfying smack, but he did not raise it. He didn't want this fight; he wanted only to vent and to be ready, just in case.

"I'm sick of this crap, Harry! You're always right, aren't you? It never matters what I do, or how I act? It's always all about perfect Harry Potter. Nothing I do is ever good enough so long as you're around, because clearly, you can do no wrong."

"What the hell are you talking---"

"Oh, can it! Both of us know *exactly* what I'm talking about. Even my father doesn't give a hippogriff's dung about me so long as you're around." He sneered viciously. "I'm done with it, Potter. I tried to help you, but I'm done. If it weren't for me, you'd be a mudblood nobody without any friends and with half their house against him." Harry flushed with fury as his wand hand began to shake. "What? You haven't realized the only reason the upper years are leaving you alone is because you're best friends with me? Well, too late; I'm done. Have fun with all that."

Draco had spun on his heel in an excellent impression of an angry Snape and stormed from the room, leaving a shellshocked Harry Potter and a thoroughly befuddled Quidditch team in his wake.

**Author's Endnote:**

**I'm sure everyone saw that conflict coming; it was really just a matter of time. I won't reveal what's happening with Draco, but this is not going to turn into a Draco bashing fic. He has a very set arc in this story and this is a major part of it. Please have patience and don't immediately judge his actions too harshly. Both he and Harry are twelve and I have a feeling people are going to forget that. They actually --- for the most part --- act their age in this story. That is going to change pretty quickly as the fic progresses, but it hasn't changed yet.**

**Author's Note:**

**I would like to issue a trigger warning for this first scene. It is darker than anything I have written so far and shows graphic depictions of restraint, violence, and gore.

**This is probably the only trigger warning I will ever issue because if you haven't realized what you're in for with this fic, you will after this, but I thought I would do it this once.**

***February 17, 1889***

***Königssee, Germany***

***12:00 PM***

A small boy stood among a group of many others, most much older and taller than he. Through a gap in the taller figures, he could make out the spectacle they were all gathered here to see, though his young mind struggled to grasp exactly what his sharp, bluish-silver eyes were watching.

It did not help that it was bitterly cold.

The last thing the boy wanted was to be here of all places, bundled uselessly against the ceaseless wind that seemed to try and penetrate his very skin. Least of all when he hadn't even an inkling why he was here.

The group of onlookers stood near St. Bartholomew's church, which rested atop one of many snow-capped mountains overlooking Lake Königssee.

The mountains rose high and stretched far, encircling the lake in their centre in what might have looked like an effort to prevent the water's escape. They formed a sort of protective ring around the body of water that had frozen over not long ago. A thin sheet of ice coated its surface, though one could still see the vividly blue water churning beneath.

It was a fair day and the sun beamed down upon them, bathing them in its light; a morbidly ironic fact on such an occasion. It gleamed off the snow atop each mountain, making the many peaks look like distorted blurs high above one of the region's most beautiful bodies of water. The rays of light reflected off the mountain and were redirected down onto the icy surface of the lake. The light danced across its surface as if it were but a sheet of glass, gleaming and sparkling like a bright star in a not-yet pitch-black sky.

The church stood atop one of the highest mountains, which allowed the wind to bite, free and unimpeded, at everyone present. It ripped at their nerves and tore at their skin, blowing the light dusting of snow from the night previous around like some pale sand in a windy desert.

Even the young boy realized that this was a particularly beautiful morning, though he had a great deal of trouble appreciating its majesty as he was too curiously entranced by the scene before him.

The onlookers formed a tight semi-circle around the front of the church. To any observing from afar, it might look as though they were trying to trap something or someone within their midst; and to be fair to such an onlooker, that was not at all far from the truth.

The tranquil scene was soon punctuated by a child's high, terrified screams. Two tall men wearing long furs half-dragged, half-carried her towards the church. She was being completely restrained and neither of the men spared her so much as a glance as she screamed out for her mutter and her vater.

The small boy saw the girl's eyes pleading with two figures who must have been her parents. They had her bright blonde hair and deep blue eyes, and their features were not at all dissimilar. What unnerved him was how detached they seemed from the proceedings. It was as if their daughter's cries meant nothing to them; like they were nothing more than the harsh whistling of the wind --- which was not nearly loud enough to drown out the child's terrified wails.

Neither of them came to her aid.

The girl's next scream was cut painfully short as it cut off in a gasp. The boy watched as the two men slammed her hard against the wall of the church. She slumped to the ground, all of the air knocked out of her lungs; light bits of snow clinging to her long dress as her chest convulsed up and down while she struggled to breathe. Hot tears streamed down her face, leaving lasting impressions before they fell onto the snow and created little bits of mist as the two substances met and their opposing temperatures clashed.

The sounds of her cries had not yet returned by the time the two men each fished something from their pockets. One of them grabbed the girl around the waist and hoisted her small, frail body into the air. She flailed, kicked, and even tried to bite the man, but it was to no avail. She was slammed hard against the wall once more. This time, the man continued holding her aloft as his partner bound her wrists. The other man let her feet graze the ground before they too were bound to the stone wall of the church.

Only now, with the girl held in a vertical, crucifix position could the youngest of the crowd examine her properly.

She would have been pretty had her face not been marred by the horrible tracks of her many tears. Her bright blonde hair fell to her shoulder blades. Her eyes were the most shocking shade of blue this boy had ever seen. He remembered the water in the lake far below, before it had succumbed to the forces of winter and frozen over, her eyes were as blue as that water in the peak of summer --- or perhaps even as blue as the perfectly clear sky that stretched out far above them. She was thin and even in her bindings, she managed to shake badly. The watching boy did not know why, but he had the strangest impression her shudders had little to do with the biting cold that was making him shake.

The crowd was rustling now. Every movement of their feet was audible as it displaced the snow. Soon, their collective muttering had drowned out even the girl's terrified screaming.

The boy felt someone grab his hand and he looked up to see his mutter. She had his own hair --- not even half a shade brighter than the bound girl's angelic blonde locks --- though his mutter's eyes were brown instead of his blue. She was normally bubbling with energy, but today the boy could not help but notice how she seemed to lack any of her normal exuberance. It boggled his young mind, but he could only assume it had something to do with why they were here. He wondered if that particular oddity had something to do with the girl.

*"Come,"* his mutter said in soft German, looking at him properly for the first time since their arrival.

Her face showed no signs of a smile as she gently pulled him in the same direction that the crowd was now moving. They had left the little girl and walked to their left, where a peculiar something sat waiting for them.

He had been here many times. His mutter was an avid churchgoer and he had been going with her for nearly as long as he could recall. He hated church; he found it dreadfully boring. He was a very intelligent child --- everyone, even him, knew that --- and he understood things he had no right to understand at his age, despite only being close to six. Understanding what was said did not make it any less dull, and he could not for the life of him comprehend why everyone loved a man they had never seen before.

In all of his trips to the church nestled high in the mountains, he had never seen the massive stack of stones that the crowd was now converging upon. The rocks ranged in size from pebbles to small boulders and the stack was nearly as tall as his mutter and several times as wide.

People began collecting these stones and making their way back into formation, regrouping into the tight circle they had stood in not a moment earlier. He and his mutter were among the last to collect their own stones. She forced a small pebble into his unoccupied hand with a distracted air about her. A part of him looked about for his vater, but he knew the man wasn't here. He did not know why, but his mutter had seemed upset when telling him that her husband didn't want to come. He had wondered whether or not that had been what the two of them were shouting about just a few days ago while they thought he had been asleep.

Their formation re-established quickly, but the atmosphere was different now. Before, it had been tense, but now, it was something more savage. Anticipation seemed to vibrate through the crowd. The young boy found it oddly reminiscent of when the children at school got excited about playing a new and interesting game.

The level of noise was different, too. There was no more mumbling. People spoke much louder. Their voices rose and rose, coalescing into a chorus of vicious jeers that echoed against the many mountains sprawled out around them. The boy could understand little of what was said. There were too many voices and so many words he had never before heard.

As the chants grew still louder, the boy's heartbeat seemed to quicken. He frowned deeply. He wasn't sure what this meant. He knew it sometimes happened after he had run for great periods of time and was starting to get tired. But he did not feel tired, just... nervous. Nervous in a way he could not explain; how could he possibly be nervous when he had no idea what was going on?

The crowd had begun chanting as one now, their savage roars tearing across the land like feral battle cries; the loud echoes only adding to the effect as the opposite mountain peaks seemed to scream their words back at them, as if daring them to do better. Now that the chorus was but one word, the boy could make out exactly what it was. It was a word he had heard once or twice before. He had read it in books he should not have been reading at his age, but his experience with the word was limited and he could not, for the life of him, understand why they would all be chanting such a thing on such a lovely day.

*"TOD! TOD! TOD!"*

Their voices grew louder and louder as the girl began to scream again. It was different this time. Not only more urgent, but it was of a higher pitch; the boy could see her eyes darting around this way and that as though she were a desperately cornered animal.

She must have understood their cries, too, and the boy wondered whether or not she might have actually realized what they meant for her. She did look to be a year or two older than him, so it was possible such a thing was true.

All thoughts on the meaning of things like chants vanished from the young boy's mind as the stones began to fly.

He did not see who threw first, but someone must have drawn back their arm and let their weapon fly.

The first stone hit the girl in the chest. The sickening crack of her bones breaking was drowned out by the bloodthirsty jeering of the crowd. The floodgates had been opened and stone after stone flew towards the girl. It was like the very Earth had deemed her foul and revolted against her very existence.

Her screams had been interrupted when the first stone had found its mark, being replaced by a gratuitous blend of a groan and a choked cry of unadulterated agony. Moans, grunts, and retching coughs could barely be heard over the excitement of the crowd for the brief time before they ceased altogether.

He wasn't sure exactly what had happened, though he suspected nothing good for the girl. It was now impossible for him to see as the tight formation had been broken. Bodies were strewn here and there as people ruthlessly tried to push to the front of the queue, all seemingly eager to throw their own stones for reasons the boy did not at all understand.

He was more confused than ever before. Why had they been throwing stones at a little girl? Especially one who seemed so completely and utterly afraid? It made no sense to him. It was not something people did to one another and he knew it was terribly wrong, but he just didn't understand why it was happening in the first place.

The crowd slowly thinned as he and his mutter drew closer and closer to the front of the queue. When they at last reached it, his mutter briefly released her tight grip on his hand and threw her stone.

He thought it somehow right to throw his own, but the sight before his eyes froze him in place more effectively than any wind could ever have done.

The girl was no longer bound to the wall. The boy would later wonder if the stones that had pummeled her had also struck her shackles and set her free.

Her body lay face up in the snow and it was a horrific sight. He could hardly process what he was seeing. Her body did not look like a body should look, nor did her head resemble anything he had ever seen on a human being.

If she had been thin before, now she was practically flat. It was as though someone had let the air out of her body; the distance between her chest and her back seemed non-existent. She appeared as one-dimensional as a bit of parchment, but that was far from the most grotesque thing he saw. Nor were her arms and legs, which were bent and splayed at twisted angles the boy hadn't known existed. Not even the jagged, oddly flat-looking bits of bone sticking out from said limbs, her chest, and her shoulders were the worst things he saw. They had punctured her skin at odd angles and resembled the world's most gruesome pincushion... if the pins had pierced the fabric from the inside.

The worst part of the girl was doubtlessly the *thing* that used to be her head.

Where it had at one time been an enclosed shape, it was now barely held together. The top was gone entirely, taking her luscious hair with it. Even the white bone inside had been horribly broken, exposing an odd, mushy thing he had never seen before. It looked as though it had at one time been something vaguely solid, but it was now a puddle of strange, chunky liquid which smelled vaguely like the fresh meat from the butchers. He saw one of the bits of her head that had used to be attached. One of the stones must have gone right through it and forced it to cave in, for it floated slowly in the fluids it had once protected.

The soup-like substance was slowly pouring out of her skull, like slow-going water from an especially stubborn well. It seemed not to exist once it left her head, however, for another substance monopolized the space around her, drowning all competition in its gory depths.

Thin, red liquid streamed from all imaginable places on the girl's body. It poured from her skull, from the places her bones had pierced her skin, and many other places the boy could not will himself to look at. The substance he knew to be called blood flowed like a crimson river, staining the pearly white snow a red as vivid as summer wine spilled upon a fine, linen cloth.

The pebble in his hands fell from numb, nerveless fingers. The sensation had nothing to do with the frigid cold, but everything to do with the sight before him. For no less than thirty seconds, he stood there and just looked at her. His expression was blank and admirably calm, given the situation, but inside there was nothing. His thoughts had just ceased once his eyes had devoured the sight. It no longer seemed to work and neither did the rest of him.

Not until, slowly, something replaced the numbness --- a horrified transfixion on the sight before him. He was fascinated and a part of him knew it was wrong, but he could not help it. He had never seen anything like this before, and it intrigued him as much as it terrified him.

He knew these thoughts were wrong, so he closed his eyes in a bid to rid himself of them, but it was to no avail. The image seemed to be imprinted in his memory with details vivid enough to match their real-life counterpart.

He opened his eyes once more and peered down at the grotesque thing that used to be a girl.

This time, he noticed something else on the ground, lying in a puddle of congealed blood and snow.

A lone bit of parchment that the boy swiped while his mutter's back was turned. There was but a name on the parchment, one the boy instinctively knew belonged to the now desecrated girl. He knew he would learn about her, one day. He knew he would learn what kind of monster had orchestrated this and he would try to understand. Then and only then could he really know how he felt about all of this. He knew he should feel horrified, but he felt next to nothing and it scared him. One way or another, he would know and he would feel. That was his promise as he peered down once more at the blood-soaked parchment in his hands.

*Wylla Nurmen*

"GAHHHH!"

Harry sat bolt upright in his four-poster in the Slytherin dorms. He was breathing heavily and his throat felt like someone had attempted to tie it in a knot. His chest wasn't much better and he could feel bile rise in his throat. He knew the sick was coming, but freeing himself from his sheets had become a task in and of itself. His fingers were as lifeless as the girl's eyes in his dream and they were as useless as the boy's who had dropped his pebble. Sweat gleamed all over his body, causing his bedsheets to stick to him like a second layer of skin.

He managed to pull free less than a second before the horrible sensation mounted.

His mouth opened on its own volition and his partially digested dinner violently rushed forth. It was unstoppable and the wet, splattering sound of it smacking into the stone floor was easily discernible. In a brief moment of lucid thought, Harry found himself especially grateful to Narcissa, despite his argument with Draco. She had taught him a very basic silencing ward over the summer. If not for his instinctual use of that spell, the entire dorm would have heard him projectile vomit in his sleep, and the experience was not yet over.

Exhausting his stomach\'s contents onto the floor around him did nothing to stop the heaving and his body continued to desperately attempt to expel his internal organs. All that came up was small amounts of bile as Harry choked on nothing. By the time it had finally ceased, Harry had been unable to draw air for some time.

Deep breaths wracked his body. He felt as though he had just run a marathon while being pelted by the very stones he had seen in his dream. Every part of him seemed to ache --- especially his head, which felt as though it might well explode from the pain. He was shaking as badly as the girl had in the dream. Every time he tried to hold still, his body seemed to go against his wishes.

He felt tears begin to stream down his face and he scowled. He had not cried in many years and he was not proud of this. None of this was anything to be proud of, but what the hell had he just seen?

He had seen it all through the eyes of the boy, but it had very clearly not been an ordinary dream. He had the distinct feeling that what he had seen really had once transpired atop that mountain. He thought he remembered the boy thinking of its name, though he could not remember. It was very clearly not one of his memories and it was something he hoped had been abolished long ago.

The crowd had been chanting something that Harry hadn't known, but the boy had. It had sounded German, but Harry somehow knew they had been calling for the girl's death.

He began to shiver violently once more as he thought of her and, unwillingly, he leant back over and added another considerable shower of his bodily fluids to what now resembled a stinking heap beside his bed.

He had thought nothing could be worse than the mutilated corpses he'd seen while at Nurmengard, but this put those people's fate to shame.

He had never imagined anything so grotesque before. He could not imagine a crime worthy of such a punishment, nor could he imagine anyone cruel enough to inflict such horrible damage upon a child.

Yet all in the crowd had thrown their stones.

All but the boy whose eyes Harry had watched through. A boy who Harry remembered reflecting on not yet being six. The boy had seen that when he was less than half of Harry's age.

Harry felt a pang of pity for the boy; this had destroyed him now, he could only imagine the effects it would have on a not-yet six-year-old child. They would be immeasurable and he could only imagine what something like that could drive one to become...

And then it hit him.

He was wearing the pendant --- he was wearing *Grindelwald's* pendant.

The crowd had been speaking German --- a language which had made itself known in the former dark lord's accent. His thoughts --- though jumbled --- had been surprisingly rational for one so young, something that indicated a startling amount of intelligence. If someone saw something like that at an early age... it was not at all difficult to see how they might have been driven to do unspeakable things.

It had been Grindelwald... the only outcome that made sense was that Grindelwald had shown Harry one of his oldest memories while sleeping. He supposed it was logical from a magical standpoint. If Harry could seek out his presence in dreams, it stood to reason Grindelwald could access the connection as well. He was also probably a master practitioner of Legilimency, which likely made the whole thing even easier.

The question was why.

Harry had an answer, one that terrified him and, to his mild disgust, intrigued him.

Grindelwald had wanted him to understand. He had wanted Harry to learn what he had truly fought for.

Perhaps this was his way of making him understand.

And, perhaps, even gaining the youth's sympathy.

Harry hated the fact that it was already working.

He conceptually knew that Gellert Grindelwald had done things more horrible than almost any person who had ever lived. He knew that the man had killed thousands and subjugated just as many. He knew first-hand that his methods were twisted and cruel, yet he still sympathized with him.

Yet even more so, he sympathized with Wylla Nurmen. Whatever she had done to earn her execution, she hadn't deserved that.

And he feared it was much worse.

A part of him knew that no seven or eight-year-old girl could ever do something deemed worthy of that, and a horrible suspicion was creeping up in the back of his mind.

He had to know, but he could think of only one way to learn and it was not something he was yet willing to do. Not after what the bastard had just put him through.

But if he was right...

If he was right, the current state of affairs in the world that he disagreed with more strongly by the day was much more egregious than he had ever realized.

Merlin, he hoped his hunch was wrong.

***September 18, 1992***

***The Headmaster's Office***

***8:02 PM***

Harry stood before the gargoyle guarding Dumbledore's office with a puzzled expression plastered on his face.

It had been a very long week. The dream he'd had days earlier still haunted his nightmares and he had been extremely distant with just about everybody since.

Not that it really mattered.

Draco had not so much as spared him a glance since their altercation the previous Sunday. Crabbe and Goyle went along with him, as they always did. Pansy also seemed to have sided with Draco, but Harry caught her throwing pained glances his way every now and then. Theodore spent all of his time in public with Draco, but he had snuck to Harry's table in a far-off corner of the library once or twice. The message was very clear, though it remained unspoken. Theodore would not abandon Harry as the others had, but he wouldn't publicly show his support and risk the ire of not only Draco, but the upper years --- who Harry was still more than a little bit worried about.

None of them had thus far made a move against him, but he could practically feel it building. Many of them just hated him on principle. His blood status, what he had done to a man who many of their families had worshipped as though he were some sort of god, and all he stood for hurt his case with many. Others had just seen the way he had fallen out with Draco and had assumed he must have committed some sort of faux pas.

He did not blame Theodore for playing it on the safe side and he appreciated his private support. He just hoped Cassie got back to him about those duelling lessons in a swift and prompt manner.

Not that he was thinking any of this right now.

He was actually quite befuddled. It had not been an easy task finding the entrance to Professor Dumbledore's office. It had taken the help of several portraits and even the Fat Friar, but he had finally arrived.

Not that it helped any. The gargoyle seemed to be in need of a password and Harry hadn't the foggiest of ideas what that might be.

He fished Dumbledore's letter from the pocket of his robes and read it over carefully. There was no password, but the postscript did capture his attention.

Surely not...

"Sherbet... lemon?"

He nearly smacked a hand to his forehead or let out an exasperated sigh when the gargoyle bowed and stepped aside. Harry swore the thing was smirking at him as he passed by and began ascending the long, spiral staircase that moved of its own accord and led up to an ornate oak door far above.

"Enter," called the voice once Harry had knocked, and he pushed open the door and stepped into Dumbledore's office for the very first time.

The office itself was large and circular. Many portraits hung on the walls. Harry would have had no idea who exactly they depicted, but golden labels on their dark frames told him they had all at one point been a headmaster or headmistress of Hogwarts. The largest of these frames hung behind Dumbledore's desk. It depicted a very old, very frail-looking man with wispy white hair that had nearly all succumbed to his age. Much unlike most of the horribly acting portraits, this one really did appear to be asleep.

There were many windows in the room and they offered a breathtaking view of the Hogwarts grounds. From here, one could see almost everything; from the vast, green lawns, to the lake --- which looked dark and deadly still at this time of night --- to the ominous and sinister-looking forest that sprawled out beyond all else, stretching on further than the eye could see.

The view was not the only interesting thing about the office. Instruments were strewn haphazardly about the room. Some lay carelessly on surfaces that did not look fit to hold them, while others rested snugly in cases or shelves. Some of these devices did nothing, while others omitted a soft whirring sound, and others still let out sporadic puffs of what seemed to be randomly coloured smoke.

A noise drew Harry's attention away from the instrument. He had heard nothing like it before. It was clearly the squawk of a bird, but it was unlike any other he had heard. Most were loud and obnoxious; the calling of crows came swiftly to mind.

But this one was different.

It was clearly a squawk, but it was like this bird spoke a language completely different from its brethren. An enchanting language of music and magic, for only through a combination of those things could one ever hope to hear anything so intrinsically beautiful.

The bird itself sat atop a golden perch off to the left of Dumbledore's desk. It was larger than most birds he had seen, though not massive like an ostrich. The bird could have been the most impressive Gryffindor mascot to ever exist. Its feathers were a crimson which perfectly matched the lions' Quidditch robes. Its tail --- which was as long as a peacock's --- was a bright, eye-catching gold; the exact same colour as its beak and claws. Black eyes met Harry's as the bird seemed to study him before letting out a strangely sad note.

"Beautiful creatures, phoenixes."

Harry's head snapped around. In the presence of such a magical creature, he had almost forgotten the man who must have owned it and the reason he had requested Harry's presence in the first place.

"Sorry, sir," Harry hastened to say. "I didn't mean to ignore you, or anything."

Dumbledore did not look upset at all; he was just smiling benignly. "Think nothing of it, dear boy. As I say, phoenixes are beautiful creatures. Most witches and wizards never see them beyond their depictions in all sorts of books. I have a great deal of respect for art, but I think you would agree after seeing Fawkes that not even the most skilled of artists could ever match a phoenix's majesty."

Harry knew at once Dumbledore was right. Being in the presence of a creature like Fawkes was entirely different from seeing one on the page of something like a textbook.

"Alas," said Dumbledore, "we are not here to discuss my loyal friend, but to discuss you and see what progress we might be able to make on our little project. I do not wish to keep you for too long. You have had a busy first two weeks, it seems. What, with a detention under your belt already."

"Ah," said Harry, trying to grasp for something to say.

He *had* earned himself a detention for the Cutting Curse he'd hit Ron Weasley with on the Quidditch pitch. Madam Pomfrey had healed him in minutes, but the fact still stood Harry had used a potentially dangerous curse on another student. He took some mollification in the knowledge that Weasley had not gotten off unscathed. Aberforth Dumbledore had given them both detention. Ron for cursing Pansy and starting the whole affair, and Harry for escalating things with more dangerous magic. The detention had not yet been scheduled, but it would take place at some point in the coming weeks.

"I have no interest in punishing you further, Harry," Dumbledore assured him. "Though I would advise you to avoid my brother's bad side in the future. Aberforth is a man of many talents, but controlling his temper has never been among them."

"I'll... keep that in mind, sir." He had an odd feeling that their Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher would not be terribly happy with his brother sharing tidbits about him.

"Please do. Keep in mind, too, that magic like what you used should not be used against others without very good reason."

Harry nodded. "Sorry, sir. I won't let it happen again."

"Very good. Now, I shan't make you wait any longer. You are here to learn Occlumency and I am here to teach you." The man steepled his fingers. "What do you know about Occlumency?"

"Next to nothing," Harry admitted with no small amount of bitterness. "Just what you told me, really. It stops people from using Legilimency and reading my mind. I've tried to find books on it, but I haven't really been able to."

He thought he might have had he really looked around in the Malfoy family library, but perhaps those books had been among those nearest the far wall Harry had been told not to intrude upon. He hadn't seen any in the rest of the room, though he hadn't looked too closely. He had looked around the Hogwarts library, but he had so far found nothing.

"I would think not," Dumbledore said quietly. "Occlumency is not something to be taken lightly." He pierced Harry with a deep gaze. "It is actually not legal to learn in the first place."

Harry's eyes widened. "It's---"

"Illegal in a sense, yes."

"What do you mean by in a sense, sir?"

"Well, you will find that, according to the Ministry of Magic, it is perfectly legal to know Occlumency and even to use it. Just as surely, however, you will discover, upon a bit of reading, that learning Occlumency is forbidden. The same way that buying books on the subject is illegal, as are selling them, but possessing them in the first place is well within the law."

"That... doesn't make any sense."

"To you, it may not. To a more seasoned politician, it is actually clever in many ways."

"Like what, sir?"

"Very few people learn Occlumency, Harry. Only the most important of people in the Ministry of Magic ever do so. Some of the lords of important Wizengamot families do as well, but even their numbers are scarce. Even fewer people who are neither of these learn of it. At Hogwarts, I think you will find that only two of the professors are well-versed in such magic beyond myself."

"Who are they, sir, if you don't mind my asking?"

"Aberforth and Severus. Minerva and Filius know of the basics, but I would not trust either of them to reliably repel a legilimens of any true renown."

"So... it's illegal, but you're going to teach it to me anyway?"

Harry was, of course, not opposed to this. He had made it onto the Slytherin team through bribery, after all, and countless Slytherins owned books that were less than legal. For some reason, Dumbledore just hadn't struck him as the type to so flagrantly violate the law.

"Why, Harry," he said with a twinkle in his eye, "I would never dream of doing such things. We are only here to discuss your extracurricular interests."

Harry's eyes widened briefly before he smiled broadly. "Of course, Headmaster."

"Very good. Now, let us begin working on that, shall we?"

Harry was not repelling any Legilimency attacks that first night. As a matter of fact, Dumbledore was not using any.

There were stages to Occlumency, according to the old man. The first stage was the understanding of one's own mind. Harry would go through a rigorous routine of meditative and discovery-based exercises which would allow him to isolate and understand his emotions. The idea was that he would be able to identify all of them as soon as they cropped up and easily internalize them. More than anything, he would gain a mastery over them. Once that happened, they could advance to actually repelling psychic attacks.

Harry found this more than a touch challenging. Mostly because these exercises necessitated the closing of his eyes. This would normally be a non-issue, but normally he would not see the broken form of a girl or her brains and blood every time he closed his eyes.

Dealing with that vision had not grown any easier in the past few days. He was at least past the point of vomiting and shedding shocked tears, but he still shuddered and became withdrawn every time the memories resurfaced. This made focusing difficult, which limited his success; something Harry was not at all happy with.

"That will do for tonight, I think," Dumbledore decided after more than an hour had passed. Harry sighed and leant back in his chair, opening his eyes and casting his gaze hastily around the room. He needed something to focus on that wasn't the blackness of his eyelids; that only brought forth the images he wanted to avoid so much.

His eyes eventually found the phoenix that had so entranced him upon his entrance, and he watched it with a vacant expression. The bird, which had been sleeping just seconds before, raised its head and met his gaze once more. It seemed to appraise him, tilting its head to the side before letting out a note more forlorn than any so far. It actually sent a pang through Harry's chest, as though it had a direct physical effect on him.

"Are you quite all right, Harry?"

Dumbledore's voice brought him back to the present and Harry shook his head slowly, blinking several times to refocus.

"I'm... fine, sir."

The old man tilted his own head much like how his bird had done a moment earlier. "How are you dealing with the events which took place at the close of your first year?"

"I think I'm pretty much over it, sir. I still wish I hadn't seen it, but... it's settled in now."

The bit with Grindelwald at Nurmengard had still haunted his nightmares before they had, this week, been monopolized by Wylla Nurmen --- but that was another matter altogether. A matter that, if Grindelwald was right, would not arise. The magically binding contract that had been triggered by taking the pendant back in the prison was supposed to keep that secret against even Legilimency. As for telling Dumbledore what had happened... that had never been on the table. The man would probably think he was crazy, or he would ask Harry so many questions he either couldn't or didn't want to answer.

Dumbledore pulled down his spectacles to examine him head-on with those deep, blue eyes. "Is there anything you wish to tell me, Harry?"

Harry kept his face completely blank as he deliberately shook his head. "Nothing, sir."

"Very well, then," said Dumbledore. "It does appear that time has not been considerate enough to slow down for us tonight. I advise you return to your common room, lest curfew draw too close."

"Harry," called Dumbledore just before the Slytherin stepped out onto the office's landing. "Do come to me if the answer to my last question changes. My door is always open to the likes of you."

"Thank you, Headmaster," Harry said with a bow of his head. "It means a lot."

And it really did, for very few adults had ever offered him anything similar.

The fact that one of the only others was a former dark lord... well, Harry wasn't sure what that said. And if that was true, he did not want to know what was implied by his growing urge to contact him and ask exactly what the hell had happened the night of his most haunting nightmare.

***The Third Floor***

***9:49 PM***

Harry's week had been long ever since that detention with Aberforth. None of what he now presumed to be Grindelwald's memories plagued his sleep, but there were other visions. Wylla Nurmen still crept up every now and again, but he had a new recurring nightmare. A sinister, inhuman voice hissing in the back of his mind --- urging him to rip, tear, and kill --- and him listening, doing unspeakable things under the voice's persistent guidance.

There was plenty more to deal with in the waking world, as well. The upper years were growing bolder by the day, and Harry now spent his free time almost exclusively in the library. The positive of this was that he was making astounding progress in pushing ahead in his magical pursuits. The second-year syllabi for Transfiguration, Charms, and Defence Against the Dark Arts were suddenly looking laughably easy. The negative was that the isolation was getting to him. It wasn't even really being alone. He enjoyed solitude when it was self-imposed. When it was forced upon him, it reminded him too vividly of the years he had spent on Privet Drive; years he would never be able to look back on with anything more than spite and bitterness.

He had just finished yet another Occlumency lesson with Professor Dumbledore. He was making great progress. The man said he was improving rapidly and that, in time, they would be able to actually begin aiding Harry in repelling presences from his mind. Even just being able to force his mind to a state of calm had come in handy often this past week. It was an apt counter to the memory of voices only he could hear, but it was not something he had yet managed to accomplish while under a great deal of stress. It still required a fair amount of focus, so the ability could not simply be called upon at one's every whim.

He wished it could.

Had that been within his capabilities, he would have done it the moment a jet of light soared past his head. It missed him by mere inches and he knew at once he had reacted in the least ideal way imaginable.

He had frozen where he stood.

Two figures stepped out from behind suits of armour and Harry recognized them at once. They had been two of the more vocal Slytherins in opposing him. One was Marcus Jugson, a sixth-year Slytherin who was the pseudo-ringleader of a pack of boys who had resorted to making Harry's life a living hell. The other was Martin Macnair. He was a fifth year and what he lacked in skill, he made up for in vicious cruelty.

"Going somewhere, Potter?"

"The common room, if you don't mind."

"And if we do?"

Harry didn't have a good answer for that and both of them knew it.

They did not wait for an answer.

As soon as he hesitated, twin jets of light flew towards him. He had scarcely enough time to recognize colours before he dove to the side and summoned his own wand from its holster with a swift flick of his wrist. He leapt back to his feet and was immediately spared by luck. A curse missed his shoulder by less than an inch, followed by a Cutting Curse that managed to graze him. Fortunately, it was only a graze. It opened a gash on his shoulder that burnt like the sting of a dozen bees, but it was not terribly deep --- nor pressing.

He feinted to the right and Macnair bought it. He tripped up Jugson and his bid to block Harry, and he knew he had his chance. Harry's wand rose and flashed towards the more talented of the two, who had stumbled and was trying to right himself. The incantation for the Cutting Curse formed on his lips, but at the last second he froze.

***"Come... come to me..."*** Harry remembered with a shudder. ***"Let me rip you... let* *me tear you... let me kill you..."***

He hesitated as the words went through him with the suddenness and immediate impact of a lightning strike. His body even ceased as though that had been the case while his brain tried to rationalize everything. Thoughts of the voice brought back thoughts of Aberforth's insinuations of all that could have gone wrong on the Quidditch pitch and, more pressingly, Wylla Nurmen's blood staining the snow with the deathly crimson glow of her mortal essence.

Pain wracked his midsection and Harry felt weightless for seconds before impact unlike most things he had ever before felt wracked his entire body. He was on the floor and he didn't realize for some time how he had come to be there. Eventually, he realized that his hesitation must have cost him, one of them must have gotten through a Knockback Jinx or something similar.

"Fucking filthy mudblood piece of shit!" snarled Macnair, bearing down on Harry with his wand raised. "Tormensia!"

Harry felt every bone in his body rebel against whatever Macnair had just cast upon him. It felt like each of them had taken to painfully grinding against its nearest counterpart, as though trying to reduce their counterparts to fine bits of powder.

"No!" Jugson screamed, and Harry felt the curse lift. "Not in an open corridor, you idiot! The boy will scream and draw attention! If you're going to torture the little shit, at least drag him into a classroom to do it and silence the door."

"What are we waiting for, then?"

"It's too late now," said Jugson. "Somebody will have heard the bang. Come on, let's go."

The two of them sprinted off in the opposite direction and Harry struggled badly to retake his feet. He had desperately hoped that no one else would come; he had no desire to be seen like this. No one did, which was either extremely fortunate or extremely unlucky. He knew at once that at least two ribs were bruised. Moving was a task and even breathing sent sharp stabs of pain up his side, as though someone had poked his very skeleton with a flaming hot iron.

He needed to be better than this.

He needed to sort out whatever the hell was going on in his head and continue to improve. One would not do without the other in check. This had been a painful reminder of that, and it was one he would be heeding.

...but Merlin, would tuning out the memory of that horrible voice be a task, and that was saying nothing of its potential return.

Harry hoped it stayed away.

***Later that night...***

He sat at a central table in the dining room of their small family home. A chessboard sat between him and his mother. His father was away and he would not return for some days, maybe even a week.

The clouds outside seemed to mourn the man's absence with Gellert, who was more disappointed than he would care to admit about the fact his father had missed his birthday just days earlier. The clouds outside were as grey as colourless fabric and they did a great job of ensuring no sunlight fell upon them from above. Snow fell in its place. It was late in the year for such snowfalls, but the sky seemed to have forgotten this fact. Gellert had never seen so much snow later in the winter and he worried for his father, out farming in such horrid conditions.

His mother moved a chess piece and set it down with surprising force. She had been quiet and had scarcely spoken to Gellert since Wylla the witch had been pummelled to death by all those stones. The departure of his father hadn't seemed to help matters. She'd indulged him in a game of chess, but it was clear it was more out of obligation than anything else.

His mind focused more on his mother than on the game as he moved his own piece. He wondered why she had spoken to him so little. He wondered why she seemed so distant. He hadn't done anything wrong when Wylla had died, as far as he could tell, and had been well-behaved ever since, too. She had no reason to be upset with him --- or anyone else, really --- but she was, and it had him more than a touch confused.

"Check," she said dully.

Gellert looked back at the board, startled. He had made a number of careless moves without thinking, so lost in thought he was. He examined the pieces and their positions and quickly realized that he was in a losing battle. He could extend the game, but he would inevitably fall to a swift checkmate unless his mother made an especially foolish mistake.

It frustrated him more than it should have.

Not so much losing at chess. He was extremely competitive and he was very annoyed at that, but the habit was one he had worked on over the years. Both of his parents had told him he needed to become better at dealing with losses and not act like a child after they took place. He had gotten a bit better at that, but the loss wasn't what really bothered him.

It was losing track of thought.

It had happened so frequently since Wylla Nurmen's death and the conversation with his father. The nightmares had receded some since their nighttime stroll, but in return, the thoughts seemed to plague him more in his waking hours. They seemed as unshakable as a shadow on a bright sunny day and Gellert could not be rid of them --- no matter how hard he tried.

His mind had just focused on it so many times.

He did not understand.

Why should Wylla have died just because she had powers that the rest of them didn't have? Why should anyone die for being better than others? If someone dies, it should surely have been because they had done something horrible? Being born with magical powers seemed quite the opposite. It seemed to Gellert like being born the wealthiest man around. He would want nothing more than to have those powers, and it seemed terribly unfair to kill children for such things. Even at his age, he felt odd about it.

He was strangely affronted by it and all of his feelings were coming to a head inside of him. They were swirling in his very chest like vengeful storm clouds, coiling tightly like an angry viper and coalescing with some resistance, like water and fire yielding a piping hot wall of steam.

Bangs could be heard all around the dining room as his mother let out a terrified scream. It took Gellert a moment to realize what had happened but when he did, his eyes widened in transfixed puzzlement.

All of his mother's pieces had leapt straight from the board with impossible fervour. A few had jumped straight upwards and bounced hard off the ceiling. Some of them had fallen to the floor, others bouncing all about the room, and a few had even clattered off the window like fast-flying bugs.

Gellert and his mother had stared at each other with wide eyes and both of them seemed to come to the same conclusion at the same time.

Gellert realized what he had done. The words of his father came back to him and he could scarcely believe them, even now.

*"Witches are real, Gellert; so are wizards, and they are not evil. They are great. They have powers that normal people could never dream of, and it isn't because they made some kind of deal with the devil. It's because they're special and made for greater things."*

He had moved the chess pieces without touching them. He hadn't wanted them to move, but he knew it was true. Losing the game had been what had made his mind travel to less desirable places, and it made sense to his young mind that it had triggered a reaction.

Did this mean he was a wizard? Had his father known this all along? Had that been why he had told him out in the town's square as opposed to in the comfortable living room of their quaint and cosy home? Had this been why the man's eyes had watched his son close as a predator might its prey as he had told the tale of magic and murder?

Gellert did not know, and he certainly did not have time to contemplate such things.

He felt pain lance through his scalp all of a sudden. He looked up, startled, and froze at what he saw.

His mother's pale, shaking fist was full of his hair as she dragged him to his feet. There was a look on her face he had never seen there before, but he had seen *it* once.

In the faces of those gathered around the church; those who had thrown stones at the helplessly bound witch who had died from those injuries.

*"Mami!"* Gellert cried. *"Mami, what are you---"*

His voice was cut off when her hand, which seemed so large to him, found its way over his mouth. She tried to pull him down the hall, but he kicked and screamed.

Fear had gripped him now, tighter than the jaws of a lion. He remembered all of the horrible dreams. The ones in which it had not been Wylla chained to the church, but him. He remembered the sight of stones flying towards him as though he had truly lived the memory.

He kicked, and flailed, and squirmed, and bit, and tried to fight, but it was no good. He was much too small and much too young. When dragging him no longer became viable, his mother simply scooped him up into her arms like she might a basket of dirty clothes. He tried to thrash, but she was much stronger than he was, and before he knew it he had been carried into his room and thrown onto his bed. The door slammed hard and he bolted to his feet, intent on opening it, but he couldn't.

His mother must have been leaning against it, else she had put something on the other side to stop him from opening it.

Gellert flopped down on his bed. Tears blurred his vision until it looked to him as though his room was cloaked in a heavy fog, and sobs wracked his body so intensely that it looked as though he was having a fit.

All he could think of was the way his mother had thrown the stone, the way Wylla's parents had done nothing, and what it might mean for him in the days and weeks to come.

***The Grounds of Hogwarts***

***7:57 AM***

The sunlight flowing down from the sky above still seemed as bright as a raging supernova to Ron, even though he had been bathing in its glow for some time now.

His robes billowed around him as though they were flowing water, and his hair whipped back in the wind, which buffeted against him like they were jousting.

It was very rare that Ron Weasley awoke so early. He could hardly believe he was awake at all. He wouldn't have been, had it not been for Cedric Diggory --- who had proposed an early-morning flight around the grounds in light of the then predicted good weather.

Ron had agreed and they had met up in the entrance hall that morning at seven. They'd departed the castle on their brooms, taking to the sky and cutting through the frigid autumn air like a knife through the butter as they soared high above Hogwarts. The aged castle looked strangely more impressive from above, as their eagle-like perspective could now drink in all of its majesty.

The two had flown for some time before Cedric gestured for them to put a halt to the fun. Breakfast was fast-approaching and they both had lessons first period. Ron flew towards the ground with him and they circled each other on the way down, laughing as they tried to fly tighter circles than the other until their feet touched down.

"Thanks for coming out, Ron," said Cedric. "It's been a shame we haven't gotten to speak much since school started back up."

Ron could agree wholeheartedly. His spat with Malfoy and Potter out on the Gryffindor had resulted in him being followed around and pestered at every passing moment for the next couple of weeks. It turned out that getting nastily cursed by the Boy-Who-Lived turned one into a sort of overnight celebrity. Ron thought he would have enjoyed the attention had it been for different reasons; he always had when it had been because of anything involving Quidditch.

"Nah, no problem," said Ron. "It was actually a good laugh. Next time, let's maybe do it at any other bloody time on the clock, but it was fun."

Cedric laughed as the two boys made for the castle's front entrance. Even from outside, the smell of bacon wafted out from the Great Hall.

"Anything interesting happen since school started?" Cedric asked. "Except for the drama with Potter and the other Slytherins."

"Just me wanting to hex a bunch of gits for following me around over it. Made me realize I didn't know enough hexes, actually." Cedric sniffed amusedly. "Other than that, not really. What about you?"

"Even less than you, I'm afraid. Us Hufflepuffs tend to not start full-blown duels on the Quidditch pitch. Just Quidditch, really. I've been made the house's starting seeker, but I'm sure you knew that."

Ron did, of course. "Congrats on that, mate."

"Cheers, Ron."

"For the record, I didn't *want* to start that duel. I just... I couldn't let Malfoy just call Hermione that."

"So he did use the word, then?"

"Yup --- wanker, he is." He scowled. "Not sure Potter's any better. I thought he might've been all right, but bloody hell. That curse could've killed me if he had aimed a bit lower."

Cedric eyed him carefully. "Something's bothering you. Any time you talk about that or seem to think about it, you get tense. What's up?"

Damn Cedric and his keen eye. There was a reason he made an excellent seeker despite being far from the most naturally gifted flyer to ever attend Hogwarts.

"I just felt useless," Ron admitted. "Potter shot that curse at me and I didn't know what to do. Not even just that. Spells were flying everywhere and I froze. It wasn't even because I was scared, I just didn't know what to do. I borrowed a couple of books from Percy on defensive magic over the summer, but they're not good enough. I've never actually duelled; I've no clue what I was doing. I never really thought I'd need to."

"Most people don't, to be fair," Cedric assured him. "Most never get into a proper duel in their life."

"Have you?"

Cedric fidgeted. "Well... yes. My father always said I needed to know how to duel. I got lessons these past two summers. Nothing super intense, really. Just basic self-defence stuff."

"Can you teach me?"

The question was blurted so hastily, Ron hadn't even paused to consider its implications. Why would Cedric take time out of his schedule to teach some second year? He could feel his face flushing as soon as the question was asked but --- to his surprise --- Cedric did not immediately shoot his request down.

He looked upon him with a critical eye. "Is this... actually something you want to learn? It's not some passing fancy because of what happened with Potter?"

"I wanted to learn it before that," Ron said eagerly. "Like I said, I borrowed books from my brother over the summer. I really do want to learn."

And he did. It ran much deeper than spells traded on a Quidditch pitch and a nasty cut courtesy of the best student in their year. The desire ran back further and its roots could be easily traced to a dark set of tunnels far beneath the castle; treacherous tunnels in which Ron Weasley had seen one of his best friends for the final time.

Cedric seemed to consider. "All right," he agreed after some pause, "if you're sure. Just the two of us, or do you mind if others get in on it? I know Susan would love lessons. She was begging her aunt for them this summer, but Madam Bones wouldn't give her any. She told her maybe in a few years, but Susan doesn't think they'll ever happen."

"I don't mind company," said Ron. "Hermione and I sit with Susan and Hannah in Herbology. They're a good sort; we just don't get much time to talk."

Cedric nodded just as the two of them stepped into the Great Hall, thus necessitating their departure from one another. "Tell you what, Ron. I'll talk with Susan and Hannah and try to find a decent classroom we might practice in. I'll get back to you if I find any."

Ron grinned, hardly daring to let his hopes rise as he made his way towards where Hermione sat near the end of the Gryffindor table. This might well be the first step to ensuring he would be weak no longer.

***October 16, 1992***

***The Potions Classroom***

***9:00 AM***

Harry was one of the first to the Potions classroom that Friday morning. He took his customary seat at the back of the class and pulled out a book on Transfiguration theory he had taken from the library. It was more complicated than any he could read, but he found it actually improved his wandwork and he needed distractions nowadays.

The dream about Grindelwald and his mother had strangely been the most disturbing one yet. It had come the very night of his beating at the hands of the upper years. Madam Pomfrey had been able to heal him easily enough, but the dream had affected him infinitely more than the curses that came before it.

There had been no horrible violence like what he had seen when Wylla Nurmen's skull had been cracked as easily as an egg and her body flattened like a pinecone that had been trodden on. There had just been an eerie and terrifying psychological shift. Grindelwald's mother had been quiet and distant before, but to see her switch from caring mother to something so deranged and single-minded had both terrified and infuriated Harry.

The sudden shift was terrifying, but the behaviour was something he had come to expect. It was not at all dissimilar from something the Dursleys might have done in that same position. For the first time, he wondered whether Grindelwald may truly understand him. It was a very worrying thought, but it made a disturbing amount of sense. Perhaps that was how his words had touched Harry so deeply. If they were not dissimilar, he might have known what to say. The more troubling possibility was that he hadn't needed to think and had spoken naturally.

If that was the case... Harry might need to do even more soul searching; which was something he had painstakingly avoided ever since hearing voices that first detention with Aberforth. In the one sense, he had just stood there for the allotted time, unwilling to so much as think of trying to slaughter the sheep that sat before him.

Harry heard a bag set down beside him, but something felt odd. He glanced to the side and did a full double-take. "Greengrass?"

The tall blonde girl had slid gracefully into the seat beside him; the one that was supposed to be occupied by Crabbe --- his designated partner, courtesy of Professor Snape.

She frowned. "I thought I told you to call me Daphne. We spoke for hours on the train, didn't we?"

Harry blushed. "Sorry, you... surprised me."

She shrugged. "We haven't gotten a chance to talk since then. I thought this was the perfect chance and time. Especially now that Draco isn't just hanging off of you at all hours of the day."

That was an interesting description. Harry had always felt as though it was him hanging off of Draco, but Daphne might have been right. Any time they were separated, it had usually been because Harry had needed space. He supposed he just viewed himself as a follower since it had been Draco who had introduced him to the magical world, but maybe that hadn't been true. Hell, perhaps that had been the cause of their separation. Perhaps Draco had realized Harry had grown out of his role of follower and the boy was uncomfortable with their evolving dynamic.

"You took your time to come find me," he accused with narrowed eyes. He didn't trust just anybody. Let alone someone who approached him in a way that seemed as blatantly opportunistic as this.

Daphne gave him a pointed look. "Do keep up, dear," she said with a roll of her eyes. "You and Malfoy argued for the entire end of last year and then you just showed up at Hogwarts in September like nothing had ever happened." She gave him a pointed look.

"You... thought we might make up again?"

She smirked. "There we go. If you haven't noticed, I don't exactly love Draco. He's..."

But what Draco was, according to Daphne, Harry did not find out. Snape had entered the room. Harry took the chance to glance around for the first time. Crabbe was sitting at a table with Goyle, though he was staring at Harry awkwardly. Harry just shrugged, but Snape did not miss the oddity either.

"Potter!" he snapped. "You are to partner with Crabbe, as I have made painstakingly obvious already. If you disobey my instructions again, it will be detention."

"Excuse me, sir," said Daphne politely, "but I was actually the one who chose to sit with him. His partner hadn't arrived yet."

Snape's eyes bore into her, but Daphne did not so much as flinch. "And why would a sensible student like yourself do such a thing, Miss Greengrass?"

"Well, Professor, I've noticed that he hasn't been doing well in Potions lately." Harry pulled a face, but he knew it was true. Partnering with Crabbe was difficult work. He wasn't naturally gifted at Potions as it was and Crabbe was worse than useless. Harry spent most of the class trying to make sure the boy didn't cause a catastrophe. It left him little time to even focus on brewing. "It's one of my best subjects, sir, and I thought I could help out a housemate. I can move if you'd like, but I'm always happy to help someone who's struggling."

Harry looked at her with a strangely hurt expression for all of a second before his brain caught up and he realized what she was doing. Her own visage was almost too polite, too perfect. Whatever Daphne's intention had been, it was not to ensure Harry had a better Potions grade, nor was it to avoid embarrassment for Slytherin House --- which was how many in the classroom seemed to have taken it.

Snape did not look at all pleased, but he knew he couldn't object. A slight bias against Harry was one thing, but handicapping Slytherin and slighting one of its more well-respected students in Harry's year... he was never going to do such a thing in front of the Gryffindors.

"In the future, Miss Greengrass, your generosity is not needed. You are a very gifted student who should not waste that talent on the likes of Potter. You may do as you wish."

Snape set them to work on that day's brew and Harry quickly became awed by the proceedings.

Daphne had asked him to prepare the cauldron while she fetched the ingredients. Her return had then led to a lengthy lecture about the importance of studying the available ingredients and selecting only the best of the bunch. She spoke of all kinds of things like cross-contamination and less than ideal conditions for some of what they would be using to rest in.

After that, they had begun brewing. Most aptly, Daphne had begun instructing Harry on what to do. For a moment, he had almost argued.

"Daphne... it says to stir clockwise, not counterclockwise."

She had only grinned at him. "Good reading, Harry," she said with a mischievous glint in her eyes. "Maybe leave the brewing to me for now, though. We'll get you there one day."

His jaw hung slack as the potion skipped its next stage entirely, completely voiding three steps in the process and immediately putting them miles ahead of the next furthest group in the class.

Harry argued no more after that.

It was the smoothest a brew had ever gone for him and at the end of class, he couldn't help but peer suspiciously at Daphne in a way that made her raise a brow.

"What is it you want, Daphne?"

"A friend?" she asked, seemingly puzzled. "Why is it so weird that I'm just being friendly? The Malfoys might view you as a tool, but that doesn't mean all of us do."

"W-what?" stammered Harry, blindsided.

She just gave him a hard look. "I'll let you work it out, for now," she decided. "Think on it and get back to me. I'll be in the library at lunch, but you're welcome to sit with my friends and me at dinner if you'd like."

And with that, she was gone, her words ringing ominously in Harry's mind.

*"The Malfoys might view you as a tool, but that doesn't mean all of us do."*

***October 18, 1992***

***Malfoy Manor***

***10:00 PM***

The ancestral home of the Malfoy family stood tall and imposing against the velvety black sky. It was made of wood so dark that it blended with the night so seamlessly it might not have been there at all. No light shone from any of its windows, and an outside observer would think all in the house was quiet.

That was not the case.

If one left the entrance hall and followed a slightly confusing sequence of corridors, they would find themself in front of a heavy oak door that would lead into a room that had not been used in almost eleven years.

Until tonight.

The room would have been bright had heavy black curtains not been drawn across its large, clear windows and had it not been the dead of night. The presence of curtains meant that not even moonlight flowed in through the windows, thus the only light that lit the room were the torches. They were hung in ancient brackets made of what appeared to be bone, spaced conservatively along the room's four walls.

A long table dominated much of this place. It was made of wood as dark as that in the home's exterior. It bore a small number of torches that cast the faces of the table\'s few occupants into shadow in the low lighting of the room.

The man at the head of the table leant forward. The torchlight washed over him. His bright blond hair gleamed like a winter's snow and his face was lit as brightly and suddenly as a pale lantern. His grey eyes seemed to somehow be brighter, too, as they observed the other three men at the table.

One had short brown hair and a hard face with a number of scars. He looked the oldest of the bunch, and his eyes were both the darkest and the cruellest. Another man had blond hair, like the host's, but his had a golden hue to it. The fourth man's hair fell to about his shoulders and it was as black as the night outside. His eyes were grey, but they were dark and seemed somehow fierce.

"My friends," said Lucius Malfoy from the head of the table. "After many years, we meet in this room again, and I trust the three of you know I would not have called upon you without... developments to report on." The air seemed to thicken until it was denser than any gas. "I have news that must be acted on at once, and I humbly ask for each of you to help me in your own way. Should we form a plan that works, I have no doubt we will be rewarded." His lips curved upwards into a smug smile. "After all, I am sure our lord will be most pleased."

**I know Harry hasn't been as present in these last few chapters but trust me, that will change. This is just a very down point in the year during which JKR did nothing canonically. I am filling it, to an extent, but I don't want to create a subplot with Harry that is going to take up a ton of words; not with the Grindelwald memories already in play. Outside of that, I am using this time to further subplots not involving Harry and giving you a look into the minds of some other characters. I hope the slight shift has been enjoyable, but worry not --- our main attraction will step back into the limelight in due time.**

***March 17, 1889***

***Königssee, Germany***

***11:57 AM***

Gellert sat alone in a vast, dark room. The ceiling was towering and the walls were wide, giving the place a cavernous sort of feel. High upon one wall, a massive window of stained glass let in a limited amount of light; just enough to cast patches of shadow sporadically throughout the room.

His shoulders ached from the painful position the chains around his wrists forced his arms into, and Gellert felt his stomach rumble for what must have been the hundredth time that day. He had been trapped here for four nights now.

The day he had been bodily thrown into his room had been a long one. He had contemplated escape, but it had not been possible. He had gone to bed afraid and confused, but even his worst expectations had utterly failed to match the horrifying reality that had violently greeted him in the middle of the night.

He had exerted so much energy in his panic that, by the time night had begun to fall and the fingers of light began to retract back over the horizon, his body felt like it weighed double its usual weight. It was as though great mounds of sand had been poured into every limb, for he could barely move by the time his head hit his pillow.

That exhaustion explained why he had not heard his bedroom door open in the middle of the night.

He had woken when he felt hands on him, but it had been too late. His hands and feet were shackled together by heavy chains and he was carried off once more; though this time, he was marched straight out of his home by men in hoods and loaded into a horse-drawn carriage.

He had been brought to St. Bartholomew's church. He had never been to the site in the dead of night, but it was impossible to miss. Especially now, after it had greeted him in so many nightmares. It was, after all, the very place that had hosted Wylla Nurmen's gruesome execution.

Gellert had been dragged through the church and thrown into the room he now resided in. Days had passed but he had not been allowed to leave. He had seen neither his mother nor his father --- nor anyone else, bar those who brought him water a few times a day. He had not eaten anything and his stomach had been writhing constantly, like a pit of a hundred vengeful vipers.

He had slept once since arriving. It hadn't been terribly long after he had come to the realization he likely wasn't going to be let out. He had closed his eyes and fallen asleep at once. It had been as fast and as easy as blinking his eyes...

Until the dream.

He dreamt of being hauled from the room by the same men who had taken him from his home. The sky outside was cloudy, but the air was warm for the time of year. Snow was beginning to melt and cracks were showing on the ice that covered the surface of Lake Königssee. It was a windless day, and as far as the weather went, one might think it a good one.

But Gellert knew better, for he was not focused on the sky, or the snow, or the glass-like surface of the lake far below them. Nor even the mountain peaks around them, still lightly coated in snow like massive cakes with their white icing slowly thinning and melting as the temperature warmed.

No, his attention was not captured by any of that, but rather by the group of people who formed a tight semi-circle around the church, just as they had the day Wylla Nurmen had been put to death.

They carried no weapons and there was no stack of stones that Gellert could see, but he knew those things mattered not. He knew at once what was happening; knew that the worst of his nightmares since the girl's execution was coming to life right before his very eyes.

The atmosphere was unmistakably hostile; even young Gellert had no trouble deciphering that. The gathered crowd muttered indiscernibly, but Gellert did not need to hear their words to know what it was they were saying. Their tones spoke volumes --- it was like the buzzing of a hundred feral bees.

Gellert was not led to the wall of the church, like Wylla had been just weeks earlier. He was led out into the centre of the clearing enclosed by the group of blood-thirsty observers. In it, a stake taller than Gellert and made of a dark-looking wood stood; it gave off an oddly malevolent air all on its own. In front of it, more wood lay. A pile of logs, stacked and organized in a way that was clearly deliberate.

As Gellert came closer and closer to the stake, the crowd's muttering rose. His bare feet felt cold as a freshly fallen snowflake. The stone floors of the church had been one thing, but the snow covered grass outside was another. Just because it was warm for the time of year didn't mean that his feet did not feel as though they had been suddenly plunged in icy cold water.

The crowd's roaring neared a crescendo as Gellert was forced to stand atop the stack of logs. Somehow, he knew he was dreaming. He knew he was dreaming because otherwise, there was no way he would have stood still and let the two men bind him to the stake as the crowd's all too familiar chants filled his ears like the most warped and twisted song the birds had ever sung.

*"TOD! TOD! TOD!"*

His feet stung from the heat as soon as his skin made contact with the wood of the pyre. The logs were not just hot to the touch, it seemed as though there was a great fire lit just beneath them.

It took Gellert several moments to realize that exact analogy was, in fact, his reality.

One of the bottom-most logs caught ablaze and Gellert let out a yelp of pain as the heat surged and he could feel the skin on his feet begin to blister. By now, he was bound by his feet and his ankles to the stake against his back. The heat began to rise. The flames licked hungrily at the pyre of logs, slowly and steadily engulfing all the matter between it and Gellert. His heart raced as the flames drew nearer and nearer to his bare skin. He could already feel that some of the skin was burnt just from the heat alone; he could only imagine the damage that would be wrought by the wrath of direct contact with an open flame.

The fire came closer and closer as Gellert's heart beat faster and faster. The closer the fire came, the faster his heart raced. It was as though the flames were some sort of warped, crimson conductor, prompting his heart to beat with all the fury of a frantically played set of drums. Every beat rang through his body and seemed to reverberate off the walls of his chest and stomach. The frenzied thumping was so powerful and so intense that Gellert thought he might be sick, or that his chest would simply cave in at any moment. It didn't feel like his heart was beating. It felt much more like someone was beating furiously against his heart for all the muscle ached.

And then, the fire reached his feet.

It was pain not unlike a simple burn, but much more intense. Gellert had somehow expected it to burn deeper than the skin, but if it did, he was so distracted by the pain at his body's surface that he didn't notice. He tried desperately to shuffle his feet in an effort to gain any form of relief, but he couldn't --- he was tied too tightly to the stake behind him. Even if he wasn't bound, he had nowhere to go. The entire pile of logs was ablaze now and the flames were slithering their way up his legs, burning away at his flesh as they went; suddenly Gellert found he had no thoughts of being nervous or afraid. Even the glimpsed sight of his mother in the crowd meant nothing to him. All he knew was pain.

Yet it was not the sizzling of his skin that troubled him the most. That felt tame in comparison to the other horror brought upon him by the sudden rush of heat and fire.

Thick, grey plumes of smoke billowed up from the burning pyre, like the darkened steam of the great locomotive he had seen barrelling down the town's tracks time and time again.

The first cloud of it that reached his face caused a fit of coughing and a painful stinging in his eyes. The second brought those feelings to an unbearable intensity. Soon, there were no waves --- just a constant stream of acrid smoke that seemed intent on drowning him in its oppressive fumes.

His eyes no longer felt as if they were stinging. It was now as though someone had taken a red-hot skewer and used it to prod his corneas. He could not so much as open his eyes, and even that wasn't the worst of it. His throat had coiled and constricted like some great serpent. The muscles seemed to have been tied in a knot so tight that it allowed for not even the barest traces of air to slip past their tightly constructed wall of muscle and flesh. Gellert's chest heaved in want of air, but he inhaled nothing but even more smoke. He felt the horrible need to cough, and felt panic rise once more despite the pain when he could not will himself to do even that.

The fire had reached his chest now and it was no longer creeping. It seemed to be moving with a speed inspired by sadistic pleasure. Every part of him it touched burned like he could never have imagined. He chanced a glance down and managed to spy what must have been his skin, but it was blackened and certainly not solid. It was streaming down his body like spilt candle wax. Somehow even more horrifying was the fact that he could no longer feel pain in his lower limbs. It was as if he was looking at someone else's burning limbs, but the stabbing in his lungs painfully reminded him that the melting skin did indeed belong to him.

Bile rose in the back of his throat and he tried to expel it, but it was met with the constricted wall of flesh and muscle that was preventing air from entering his lungs. He wretched, trying to draw in air and force out bile, but he couldn't; black spots were dancing before his eyes now, growing larger and larger as the crowd's roaring turned from malicious to victorious...

And then he was awake with a gasp, shaking and gulping down air like a dying man who had been long deprived of water. Every part of his body shook as he glanced down towards his chest. His skin was there and intact, but Gellert had the strangest feeling it might not be that way for long.

Something about that dream had felt different. For all the fear he had felt, never had there been an overwhelming sense of panic. It had more so been that he was afraid to feel the pain. The strangest thing about the whole ordeal was that at no point during the dream had Gellert felt any urge to flee or escape. He had felt... resigned. He still felt resigned now, though to what he didn't know.

That dream had been days ago now and he had not slept since. It was hardly an experience he wanted to repeat. Nothing even remotely similar would be at all something he would want to go through, so he had stayed awake --- resigned to whatever would come --- not bothering to hope for a rescue from his mother or father.

A high and loud squeal filled Gellert's ears as the room's large door opened, causing the hinges to creak horribly.

Two men entered the room. Gellert felt his heart begin to quicken when he recognized them. They were the same men who had taken him away from his home, and they were the same men who had led him out to the pyre in his dream.

As they unbound him from the wall, dragged him to his feet, and began to march him out of the room without so much as a word, Gellert knew he should feel panic, but he didn't. He felt eerily calm and his mind was as clear as the water streaming beneath its icy confines far below in Lake Königssee. He scarcely felt more awake than when he had been dreaming. It was as though he was watching from the perspective of an observer for how detached he was.

It came as no surprise when he stepped outside to a cloudy sky, warm air undisturbed by wind, or the soft dripping brought forth by melting snow and its remains streaming down the side of the mountain. Nor even was he surprised by the tight semi-circle of ravenous observers watching his every move.

He did not look to the centre of the circle. He somehow knew the pyre would be there. Instead, he searched the crowd for his mother's face. He found her quickly enough. She had his bright blond hair, and many of his own facial features were recognizable on her as well. Her eyes seemed to be constantly drifting, but they never did quite find him until she must have felt his stare upon her.

The look in her eyes was one he had never seen before. The soft light that seemed to perpetually dance behind those eyes like the rays of the sun on smooth water seemed to have gone out. There seemed to be no life behind them. It was as though she was only half there, and Gellert knew all at once that she would be no help to him.

Something burned deep in the pit of his stomach. It was not fear --- his heart had not yet begun to beat with the ruthless intensity he had felt during the dream. It was a different feeling that he had never felt in this way before. Sometimes, late at night, he would think about Wylla Nurmen and how and why she had died. Those thoughts often caused a feeling that was not terribly dissimilar to this, but it was hardly comparable.

Tears suddenly threatened to leak from the corners of his eyes, but they were not born of fear, or pain, or even sadness. They were born of something more raw and vicious. He thought whatever this emotion he felt was very much like anger, but it was somehow more than that. He did not know the words, but he realized as he was being led to his death that he was angry with his mother. Angry with her for dooming him to this, and angry at her and all the others who had thrown stones at Wylla Nurmen just because they were nothing compared to her.

He hardly even realized he had stepped onto the pyre of logs until the familiar pain began ebbing its way into his feet. None of the logs had yet caught fire, but he knew it was but a matter of time. Thin swirls of smoke rose from beneath the stack of logs, rising and twisting in the air like demented steam. Not the sort that rose from enticing meals, Gellert knew. These swirls promised no salvation or comfort, only pain and death.

He thought he ought to be more nervous. His heart had well and truly begun to speed up now, but it was reaching nowhere near the levels of rapid pumping he had experienced during the dream. Though that was changing as the logs began to heat up beneath him. When the first tendrils of fire snaked their way up and lit one of the bottom-most logs ablaze, Gellert's mind and body seemed to catch up with the situation at hand and he felt a sudden weight in his bladder as his breathing became more ragged; unbidden thoughts and memories of choking in the impenetrable clouds of smoke rushed forth to the forefront of his mind.

A scream sounded, echoing off the mountain peaks all around them. For a moment, Gellert felt confused. The pain was building and his feet were beginning to blister, but despite that, he did not remember screaming. He couldn't imagine why anyone in the crowd would scream. They had all been so gleeful through his persecution, and he could not imagine what might change that.

Until he saw him.

Gellert's eyes were drawn to a break in the semi-circle where a number of figures had seemingly fallen. Through the divide in their ranks, he spotted a face he was sure he'd never see again. It was the opposite of looking at his mother in a great many ways. The man's brown hair was darker than Gellert's, but his blue eyes had the same silvery hue as his son's. Where his mother's eyes looked hollow, emotionless, and void of any light or life, his father's seemed to burn with the intensity of a hundred roaring fires.

He had a peculiar-looking stick of wood in his hand. It appeared to be about a foot long and was dark and well-carved. Gellert had never seen anything like it before in his life, but he had read about similar objects depicted in some of the tales he had read, oftentimes not long before going to bed. It reminded him of the wands from those tales and his jaw fell agape when the stick of wood was aimed at him, and suddenly, the blistering pain in his feet seemed to ease. Where the skin had already suffered damage, the pain did not waver, but the fire suddenly seemed incapable of consuming any more of him.

The crowd seemed as confused as Gellert until one of them cried out something the young boy did not understand. Suddenly, they were all turning to rush at his father. Gellert felt the urge to scream for the first time as fear for the man he loved more than any other rose within him like a helium balloon.

Yet there was no need for it.

His father spun on his heel before any could reach him and disappeared with a loud *CRACK!*

Gellert's mouth fell open despite his own predicament. The act proved an ill-thought one. Smoke had begun to billow upwards in thicker clouds and he inhaled a large mouthful of it. True panic surged inside of him for the first time that day. He remembered his dream, the way every muscle of his chest had seemed to contract and tighten, his body's fighting need for oxygen with the vigor of a charging bull as he suffocated on the smoke that surged from the burning pyre. Fear gripped him now and he began to thrash against his bindings for the first time. The exertion wasn't helping his cause. Black spots were dancing seductively at the corners of his eyes, but thankfully, he didn't have to endure for long.

As though in a dream or from far away, Gellert thought he felt his binds release. He knew he was falling forward, but he was too weak to catch himself. He just hoped that he fell off of the pyre and onto the melting snow all around it. Anything was better than kissing the flames still burning fiercely at his feet.

He wondered if the latter might indeed have happened when oxygen was deprived from him for a second time. He felt like he was being squeezed through a tube much too narrow to accommodate his body. Pressure seemed to close in on all sides and not an inch of him was safe from its tight grip. He wondered if his mother had been right about the afterlife after all, and whether or not this might have just been some great tube leading to the heaven he had never believed in, but he succumbed to the darkness before he could find out.

Harry awoke shivering and gasping in his bed, shaking like a leaf caught in a strong autumn wind.

Whilst taking deep, calming breaths, Harry reflected that the vision he just witnessed may have been the worst of all the dreams Grindelwald had thus far shared with him. The first vision concerning poor Wylla Nurmen had been by far the most gruesome, but this one had been different. Though Grindelwald had not been burnt at the stake, the dream he'd had about that very thing happening had been more vivid than any dream Harry could ever remember having.

Well, any dream not forced upon by the one-time dark lord.

Experiencing the panic and agony that dream had brought on had been something entirely different. It was not nauseating in the same way watching a little girl pummeled by a volley of stones was, but it was grim and terrifying on a level completely of its own.

Yet, for all the pain and horror Harry had witnessed, that was not the thing that scared him most.

The thing that most scared Harry was that after watching all he had seen thus far through Gellert Grindelwald's eyes, he was starting to see why the notorious dark lord might have thought starting a war against muggles to be a worthy cause.

***A Hidden Room***

***8:30 PM***

It had been more than a week since Ron and Cedric had discussed the idea of practicing defensive magic with their friends. All had agreed it was an idea worth pursuing; that had been the easy part. The hard part had been finding a place to do it.

It had been Susan who had put forth the idea. She apparently spent large periods of time exploring the castle, and had come across a hidden room. She said the way into the kitchens is what had given her the idea. She told Ron and Hermione that to enter them they needed to tickle a certain bit of fruit in a portrait hung on the wall, so she had started trying similar things with other portraits in the surrounding area. Her exploits had yielded nothing for some time, until she had come across a particular suit of armour by happenstance.

She had been looking all over the suit of armour for some kind of oddity that might indicate it was hiding something when she had accidentally knocked the sword from its hand. The loud clang of the steel colliding with the stone floor had been worrying, but it had not been what made her jump. What made her jump was when the depicted knight bowed to her, retrieved its sword, and stepped aside, revealing a passageway that Susan had never seen before.

It was dark and led to a room with no door. Since the room was protected by a secret passageway, she had supposed it didn't need one. The room was large, dark, and completely barren. No decor was in sight, nor were there any form of windows. A scarce few torches flickered in a conservative number of brackets hung along the wall. The room was a bit smaller than the ones they used for lessons, but when she showed it to Cedric, the older Hufflepuff had deemed it more than sufficient for their purposes.

Cedric had placed the small number of privacy spells and wards he knew upon the room that night when they all arrived. They fortunately did not need to send the knight's sword flattering deafeningly to the floor to gain entrance. Simply removing it from the suit's grasp sufficed, so they entered the room with little drama.

Ron and Hermione had been told of the room in advance, but the former realized immediately upon entering that Susan, Hannah, and Cedric had done some remodelling. There were more torches than he had expected, and even some spheres of magical light floated about the room. There was a couch along one wall and two armchairs nearby, as well as a small number of desks in the room's corner. Most of the space remained open, obviously intended as the space they would use to practice.

"Did you make those?" Hermione asked Cedric, gesturing to the furniture.

"I did, yes."

"Isn't that really advanced magic? I've heard they don't even teach conjuration until sixth year. Aren't you only in your fourth?"

"Well... yes, I am, but I do study hard and Transfiguration has always been my best subject. With enough work, it really isn't all that impressive."

Susan punched him in the arm. "Come off it, dork." She looked at the others with a roll of her eyes. "He conjured the magical lights, too. I'm not even sure if we get taught how to do that here."

"Cedric is a genius with Transfiguration," Hannah piped up. "Professor McGonagall says he's one of the most talented students she's ever had."

The boy in question was blushing to the roots of his hair now. Ron had always scoffed when people told him he blushed as bright as his hair. He had always doubted the possibility of such things, but Cedric was beginning to make him reconsider that assessment.

"I'm no Transfiguration prodigy," he argued. "Conjuring all of this took me days. We could have been in here last Sunday had I been able to pull it off earlier." Ron smirked when Cedric seemed to notice that none of them looked at all convinced by his act of modesty.

"Since he's such a genius," said Susan with a sharp grin, "how about he starts our first lesson, huh?"

"I'm *not* your professor," said Cedric. "This is a group effort. We'll all be doing as much as we can to help each other improve."

"Mate," said Ron, "we all appreciate the nice guy act, but can we get on with it? You promised to teach me spells. Can we skip this rubbish and get to the important bits?"

Their collective laughter broke the tension all at once and Cedric's uncomfortable air vanished as he drew his wand and straightened his posture, clearly ready to begin.

***October 26, 1992***

***The Great Hall***

***8:22 PM***

Harry watched Draco enter the hall with Theodore, Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle that morning and had to resist the urge to frown. He was sitting with Daphne, Tracey, Millicent, Lillian, and Blaise. The few days of awkwardness between him and everyone else in the group that wasn't Daphne had passed, but part of him still felt like an outsider. Hardly a surprise considering he had felt somewhat of an outsider among Draco's friends, too. The concept of friends was just not one he had yet become completely accustomed to.

He liked Daphne and her friends more than he had expected. Daphne herself was outgoing and charming. She seemed to possess a deadly amount of charisma and had an uncanny ability to make people like her. She was also probably the most intelligent person Harry had ever met. It was strange that her wandwork was actually subpar in Transfiguration and no better than average in Charms because she knew the theory in each of them as well as he did. Her best subjects --- outside of Potions --- were the ones they wouldn't start until next year; that being Ancient Runes and Arithmancy. She seemed to be a sort of prodigy in both. That coupled with her obscene ability to process information quickly and accurately was what had caught Harry's attention early on. The fact he could not for the life of him seem to beat her at chess only added to the air, though that bit annoyed him more than he would care to admit.

Tracey was much more introverted but, when she became comfortable, she had a dry, cutting sort of humour that Harry found both amusing and endearing. She was in many ways the opposite of Daphne. She had a respectable amount of talent with a wand, but her theoretical work was average at best. Though obviously intelligent, she seemed to Harry like the laziest of the bunch.

He didn't know the other three as well. Millicent and Lillian only sometimes hung around, and seemed to follow Daphne around like a pair of lost puppies; Blaise Zabini was extremely quiet. He was a tall, dark-skinned boy with dark slanted eyes and short-cropped black hair. He was very athletic-looking and seemed to always have the hints of a smirk playing at the corners of his lips. Tracey had mockingly reflected that Blaise must just be part of some kind of perpetual joke the rest of the world had not yet been made aware of.

Harry had eased slowly into the group over the past week and a half. Daphne had practically carried him through many conversations at the beginning, but the others had eventually warmed up to him. He was still very conflicted about the entire situation, but there was no doubt as to one benefit of it all. Since aligning himself with the Greengrass heiress, the older purebloods who had been targeting him had all seemed to cease their attempts. They clearly had no desire to make an enemy of House Greengrass. That part was nice, at least, but it made Harry think of the words Daphne had said to him at the end of that first Potions lesson during which they had worked together.

*"The Malfoys might view you as a tool, but that doesn't mean all of us do."*

The statement made Harry feel a bit guilty for the relief he felt at being, for all intents and purposes, sheltered by Daphne's name, as well as making him wonder whether her words had been true.

Did the Malfoys view him as a tool?

They had all been nothing but kind to him with the exception of his two major arguments with Draco. Even after each of them, Diana hadn't stopped speaking with him and it seemed like neither Lucius nor Narcissa bore him any ill will. He supposed it was possible. He didn't fail to remember the way Diana had stopped Draco from putting his foot in his mouth a number of times during that first meeting, but that could really just be chalked up to Draco being Draco and Diana being responsible.

Harry was conflicted about the whole thing. He never had understood why Diana was so willing to spend so much time and effort on him and his problems. If she were manipulating him, that would be a logical explanation. Yet at the same time, she had never given him any council he had not found immensely beneficial. She had even helped him in dealing with Draco. It was possible she had guided him down a path she wanted him to walk down, he supposed. He wouldn't discount the possibility --- especially not now, whilst Grindelwald was showing him exactly how powerful such guidance was --- but he didn't see a motive.

He didn't see what the Malfoys could possibly want with a halfblood from a family traditionally opposed to their own. His Wizengamot vote when he came of age, he supposed, but this seemed a disproportionately large amount of effort to spend on votes they could likely just buy elsewhere.

Now that Daphne had planted that treacherous weed deep in the soil of his mind, he could not help but overanalyze everything. The way Diana had spoken so carefully when discussing things like blood traitors and bigotry. Or the way Draco had needed to be saved in conversation by both his sister and Pansy on a number of occasions. Or even the way Lord Malfoy seemed to have taken to him with unnatural speed.

He could not decide yet, but he would be more watchful. Not that he was entirely certain Daphne didn't view him as a tool. She may have been intelligent enough to pull off some kind of manipulation, which only made him more wary; especially after the recent collapse of his relationship with Draco. But for now, she and her friends were the best he had and he was enjoying their company. He would proceed as he had been and would just be certain not to let his guard down.

The ceiling high above reflected an overcast sky. The clouds seemed to grow thicker for a moment, but they were not clouds at all. Just the many beating wings of dozens of owls flying into the hall and bearing all sorts of letters and parcels for their owners. Hedwig was among them this morning, easily distinguishable by her dazzling white plumage and the way it stood out against the dull greys and browns of her many feathered companions.

The envelope she delivered was unmarked. Frowning, Harry reached for it and broke the seal, only to withdraw his hand just in time to avoid it being covered in a thick, yellowish-green liquid that stank worse than the petting zoo he had visited years ago while attending his muggle primary school. The smell was difficult to describe, but it was vaguely reminiscent of petrol.

Daphne stood quickly. She grabbed both Harry and Tracey by the arm and hauled the both of them to their feet. Blaise had risen at once and Millicent and Lillian were now scrambling to avoid the thick, viscous flow of the horrid-smelling liquid. A couple of students nearby hadn't been nearly as lucky. Some of them were covered in the stuff. Wherever it touched them, their skin had blistered horribly and was now beginning to swell just as bad.

Harry's heart pounded in his ears as he watched the scene before him with a numb some sort of detachment. Whatever had been in that envelope had been meant for him.

His eyes searched the Slytherin table, seeking out all who were staring at him. There were many sets of eyes and Harry met each of them briefly before he felt... something and did a double take. Damian Travers's older brother was among the many who stared at him. Harry remembered the way he and his friends had tried to attack him last year, but they had been stopped by the then Head Girl, Gemma Fawley.

Merlin, it had been a while since Harry had thought of her. She'd helped him so much, but he could not say he held any love for her. Not after she had been the one to give him the portkey which transported him to Nurmengard and became the root of the horrible visions he saw most nights now.

When he looked at Travers, he felt... smug? It was strange because he had no reason to feel smug, yet he did. His eyes narrowed just as Travers looked away. He had a bad feeling about him... and just when he had thought the upper years might have finally decided to leave him alone.

"Bubotuber pus," Daphne hissed in a venomous whisper. "That stuff isn't something to play around with. Whoever sent that isn't exactly your secret admirer."

"I've noticed that, yeah." Harry looked from the screaming victims of the pus, to Snape --- who was swiftly striding towards the source of the commotion --- to Daphne, who stood beside him looking pensive. "What is that stuff, anyway? Bubo... whatever you called it."

"Bubotuber pus," she repeated. "When diluted, it's used for a few things, but one of the most common is to treat acne." She scowled; Harry thought the expression failed to suit her face. "When it isn't diluted..." she gestured vaguely in the direction of those covered in the stuff, not needing to go on.

"Aren't you just Mr. Popular," Blaise said softly. A smirk actually was on his lips now, though it was a thin and discrete one.

Harry made to quip back, but he became distracted by Daphne. She was very carefully wiping all traces of pus away from the envelope with a number of napkins. Harry quirked a brow, but she ignored him, pocketing the now safe envelope.

"There are things that can be done with this," she said, "ways we might actually find who sent it."

"Find who sent it?"

Daphne fixed him with a hard stare. "I'm not sure what it was like in Malfoy's little clique, but I take it personally when someone tries to hurt any of my friends. I plan on finding who sent this."

Harry glanced around to make sure no one was listening before leaning into Daphne's ear. "Maybe start with the older Travers."

It was a mark of her composure that she did not seem even a bit taken aback by the comment. Her eyes just briefly flicked towards the boy. Knowing Daphne, she was probably quickly and accurately committing his face to memory.

If it was the case, she nodded. "Leave it with me," she said. "I'll come up with something."

***October 31, 1992***

***The Great Hall***

***6:00 PM***

The hall was luridly decorated in the typical muggle fashion one might expect on the final day of October. Daphne did not look pleased about it, nor did Millicent and Lillian. With the exception of a few snarky comments by the Greengrass heiress and a number of very testy glares sent around the hall by Millicent, none of them outwardly complained about it. Harry wondered if Draco and Theodore were cursing it all just as vehemently as they had last year.

Dumbledore stood to his feet, drawing the attention of all in the hall. His robes were a deep black this year as opposed to the vibrant orange he had dawned exactly a year ago. It seemed the man was unable to wear normal robes as these ones were not only trimmed in the aforementioned colour, but they were covered in a number of pumpkins of that same colour. They were all jack o\'lanterns and they must have had the same magic as portraits. Their bright eyes roamed the hall in an amusing yet unnerving way. To complete the image, Dumbledore wore a tall, pointed wizard's hat the same colour as his robes.

"Happy Halloween to you all," said Dumbledore. "Or, for those of you who still stick steadfastly to the old ways, I hope Samhain has treated you well. Seeing as we do not seem to have any caretakers or trolls set to interrupt us this year, I think it is high time the feast begins!"

Dumbledore swept his hat from his head with a theatrical gesture, and food and drinks of all kinds appeared on every available bit of table. The man smiled and took his seat, and Harry too could not help but silently reflect how much more peaceful this Samhain seemed to the last.

***Meanwhile, in the dungeons...***

"Remind me why we're going to this... what's it called again?"

Hermione sighed. "A deathday party, Ronald."

"Right, that. Why are we going?"

"Because it would have been rude to say no."

On the way back from practicing with Cedric, Susan, and Hannah that first night, Ron and Hermione had been stopped by Nearly Headless Nick --- the Gryffindor ghost. He had invited them to his six-hundredth deathday party on the 31st of October. It would be taking place at the exact same time as the Hogwarts feast. Ron had been less than keen, but Hermione had graciously accepted before he could get so much as a word in.

"I think I'd rather a ghost think I'm rude than miss the feast," Ron muttered, mind full of all the mouth-watering that were doubtlessly sprawled across all of the house tables even as they spoke. "Why didn't you ask the Puffs to come, anyway? Would've been nice to have more living company."

"Oh, come on, Ron, isn't it obvious?" He just stared back at her blankly. "They're not Gryffindors and Nick didn't invite them. What right do we have inviting them to someone else's party?"

"What right do you have making me miss the feast," he muttered, but Hermione didn't respond, for the door loomed ahead of them.

Ron's stomach rumbled and he hoped that this 'deathday party' at least had some decent food for its guests.

***About two hours later...***

The Great Hall was filled with the cacophony of scraping benches as all the students took to their feet, some more easily than others. Many of them were happily weighed down by the copious amounts of food they had consumed. Harry was amongst them as he followed his housemates from the hall. When they exited, his brows rose as he saw Weasley and Granger clearly on their way... somewhere.

Harry heard the red-head curse colourfully as they passed him by. He was muttering something about how he couldn't believe he had missed the feast. Harry hadn't noticed his absence, but it was odd. Weasley was no Crabbe or Goyle, but he was well-known for his appetite. Him not being at the feast seemed strange somehow.

He and the other Slytherins were about to make their way down into the dungeons when a horrible scream pierced the air. It sounded like all the cries of the fabled Greek river Acheron had come to life and let forth their anguish in one unified cry of complete and total despair.

Everyone from all four houses froze all at once. The school stood collectively still for what must have been ten long seconds while they waited for any more noise from above. More screams came and as one, the school seemed to decide that they were all suddenly much too curious and no longer weighed down by food and drink.

Many of them took the stairs up two and three at a time, shoving past each other to try and get to the front of the queue. Harry saw Crabbe and Goyle buffeting people out of the way left and right and suddenly wished he was in their wake. Millicent wasn't doing too badly at that herself though, so Harry and his friends made good progress, even if they weren't the first into the hallway.

He noticed the water first. It was everywhere, covering the entire corridor in a liquid layer several inches deep. It seemed to come from nowhere, yet it was everywhere and it stunk unnaturally. The next thing Harry noticed was yet another pained wail.

He looked up towards the source of the sound and saw Filch on his knees in front of a strange-looking torch bracket. Harry could not ponder why the man had decided to kneel in the water, nor why he was screaming. At least not until Daphne gasped from beside him.

"Merlin," she muttered, sounding all of a sudden quite breathless.

Harry looked more closely, now confused, and his eyes widened once they saw what he had missed the first time. His blood ran cold at the sight. What he had thought to be a strange-looking torch bracket was far more sinister. Mrs. Norris, Filch's cat, hung limply from the bracket, looking as lifeless as a puppet with its strings having been cut. It was clear now why the cantankerous old man had been shouting bloody murder for the entire castle to hear, but that was not what most drew Harry's attention.

Upon the wall --- beneath the bracket and limp body of Mrs. Norris --- were sinister words written in a crimson smear that looked altogether too much like blood. Harry was sure it was indeed blood; he had seen enough of it in his dreams to identify it by now. The crimson writing spelled out an ominous message. Harry didn't understand a word of it, but it still somehow made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.

***October 31, 1992***

***The Second-Floor Corridor***

***8:19 PM***

Harry stared blankly at the wall as the crowd around him began to buzz. Muttered conversations broke out like hissing wildfires, rapidly rising in intensity as though their flames were being carefully stoked.

Enemies of the Heir, beware... 

What did it mean? Heir as in the heir of an Ancient and Most Noble House? Harry couldn't think of what other context made sense here, but that didn't seem quite right. Why would some rich pureblood be going around writing threats on a school wall? It seemed somehow beneath them. Draco might, if he had the motivation or the capabilities, but Harry doubted whatever had happened to Mrs. Norris had been Draco's doing. He had been at the feast with the rest of them.

That thought triggered another memory in his mind. The memory of Weasley and Granger hurrying towards the hall just as the rest of them made their exit. 

Harry's eyes swept the crowd and found them not far from the front. They must have made a mad dash for the stairs as soon as the sound of screaming had made its way down to the gathered crowd, or else they had already been among the students climbing when it had happened. They made sense as suspects, seeing as they hadn't been at the feast, but Harry couldn't see how anyone in the crowd could have done this and been seen coming from the floor below. 

The two of them were staring at the wall with expressions much like the one Harry thought he must have been wearing. Their eyes were wide and full of confusion and their jaws were slack. Harry tried to meet their eyes, but he couldn't. They may have been the most likely culprits, but somehow he doubted it. He didn't know all that much about Granger or Weasley, but he didn't think either of them to be good enough actors to pull off a performance like that, especially in the face of the stress they would be feeling if the whole school really had just come about their crime scene. Weasley certainly hadn't seemed a master of his emotions during Neville Longbottom's funeral.

He glanced to his other side where Daphne and the rest of his friends were standing. Most of them looked every bit as confused as Harry felt, but Blaise and Daphne served as the exceptions. Blaise's face looked perfectly blank and Daphne's looked as though she had just solved some great puzzle. There was a light behind her eyes that clashed strangely with the obvious worry and apprehension etched upon every inch of her face. 

"You'll be next, mudbloods!"

Harry's head whipped around the second he heard the call. He had recognized the voice at once, but part of him had hoped it wasn't Draco. It was. He --- or more likely Crabbe and Goyle --- had pushed to the front of the crowd. The look in the boy's eyes seemed almost deranged. The way the grey of his irises shimmered in the torchlight made them look like vengeful storm clouds.

Harry remembered what had happened the last time Draco had used that word. He had been so distracted by the chaos on the pitch that he had not considered how he had felt. He disliked the word. He was beginning to understand why many purebloods stood so strongly against those whom they considered to be blood traitors, but to condemn an entire demographic based on a small number choosing not to follow your ways, or whatever their reason was...

It also struck too close to home for him. He was a halfblood born to a muggleborn mother. He had never known her, nor did he feel all that attached to her, but it was still a consideration. He had spent a great many nights in his cupboard wishing for his parents to rescue him. Though they never had, the thought was there.

"What's going on here?"

The thick Scottish accent clearly belonged to McGonagall. She was among a procession of professors; Dumbledore led the way, but McGonagall trailed him alongside Snape, Flitwick, Sprout, and the headmaster's brother. Harry tried hard not to glare at Aberforth. The old bastard had not given him a reprieve. Harry had been hoping that if he refused to kill the lamb for long enough the codger would let him off, but he hadn't and Harry couldn't understand why the man was so needlessly cruel. 

"My cat!" screeched Filch. "One of the little bastards killed my cat! I know they did! I'll kill them, whoever did it, I'll string them up by their bloody ankles and rip the head from their shoulders. Every single one of them!"

"I do hope that will not be necessary, Argus," said Dumbledore, striding purposefully towards the torch from which the cat's lifeless body hung. 

The students parted before him and the other professors so he reached the cat in good time. He plucked her body delicately from the torch after running his wand over her lifeless form a number of times. 

"She is not dead." Though Dumbledore spoke softly and in a hushed tone, every student heard the words. The crowd had fallen silent as soon as the old man had reached the torch bracket.

"But-but," stammered Filch.

"I assure you, Argus, your companion is very much alive. Come, we shall discuss in more detail, but we shall do so in private." He turned to the gathered crowd. "Everyone is to return to their common rooms. Curfew will be called to order in fifteen minutes' time. Chop chop!"

"It was Weasley," yelled Draco. "Weasley did it! Him and Granger! They weren't in the Great Hall at dinner!"

Harry's jaw tightened. Draco still had not yet prevailed over his obsession with Ron Weasley, it seemed. He'd hoped that perhaps Neville Longbottom's death might have made his former friend grow up a bit in that regard. Between the incident on the Quidditch pitch and his behaviour tonight, it was painfully clear that Harry had done so in vain.

Dumbledore fixed Weasley and Granger with his blue-eyed stare. Harry could see the way Granger tensed and how Weasley's eyes grew wide and frantic. A pink flush was creeping up his body, too, but he seemed to hide it well. If Harry hadn't known Draco to be incapable of such a feat, he might have truly thought the blond responsible for the hanging of the cat. It was almost as though he was trying to frame Weasley and Granger. It might have seemed like an attempted cover-up had Harry not been all too aware of the boy's spiteful grudges.

"Is this true?" Dumbledore asked the pair of them. "Were you at the feast tonight?"

"It is, Albus," said Professor McGonagall. "They were reported missing to me. I thought not to trouble you with it during the feast."

Dumbledore's face was impassive. "Master Weasley, Miss Granger, do join us, if you would be so kind." He glanced back at the crowd. "Off with the rest of you. A good night to all."

Ron fidgeted uncomfortably as he followed Dumbledore and the other professors. They seemed to be moving in the opposite direction as the rest of the school. Hermione was a mess beside him. She was shaking like a panicked dog in the middle of a thunderstorm; Ron vividly remembered the breakdown she'd had last May when the muggleborn had thought the two of them, plus Neville, were going to be expelled.

"May we use your office, Aberforth?" Dumbledore asked. "It is closest, I believe."

"If you must," the man grunted. Ron liked Aberforth a great deal. He was miles better than Quirrell had been. He had arrived at the school at an ideal time for Ron, too; just as he took an interest in Defence Against the Dark Arts. 

Much as Ron liked Aberforth, he found his office to be unbearably dull. Malfoy might have mocked him for his place of residence, but the thing Ron had always liked about the Burrow was that it was never predictable. It was always interesting and the house was never dull, either in terms of the atmosphere or the aesthetic. His professor's office was almost completely void of any and all decor. Only two portraits ornamented the room, and the professor had stood in front of one and moved the other out of sight with his wand before Ron could get a clear view of it.

"They killed her!" Filch shrieked, pointing a gnarled finger towards Ron and Hermione. "You heard the boy in the corridor! They weren't at the feast, it must have been them, I want them punished, I want them hung, I want---"

"Argus, I must implore you to calm down or I will be forced to request you leave. Given the circumstances, I believe you deserve to be here for this meeting. Please do not force me to ensure you are not present." Filch snapped his mouth shut. Dumbledore laid Mrs. Norris down upon the desk and began examining her much more closely than he had in the hallway above. "It is as I said," Dumbledore turned his blue-eyed stare on Filch, "she is not dead, Argus."

"N-not dead?"

"It appears to me that Mrs. Norris has been petrified. By what, exactly, I'm afraid I cannot say." He looked to Snape, who had thus far not said so much as a word. "Would you care to have a look at her, Severus?"

Snape nodded curtly and stepped forward, drawing his wand like a sword as he did so. His long nose nearly touched the cat's fur as he ran his wand over her, muttering in strange and ancient tongues Ron would likely never know. 

He was at it for a number of minutes before he straightened. "This is nothing I have seen or heard of before." His voice was as impassive as the calm sea. "She has been touched by no curse that I can identify and I am certain that no poison was involved. I do not know what else could have done it, Headmaster."

"Nor do I," Dumbledore admitted. Ron noticed that the professors cast odd glances at each other when that was said. Flitwick, McGonagall, and Sprout seemed to fidget, too. "It is a most perplexing case."

"Ask them!" Filch exploded, glaring at the Gryffindors with the intensity of Medusa. "It was them; it must have been!"

"No second year could have done this," Dumbledore said softly. 

"Yet they are the only viable suspects we have." Snape's voice was smoother than silk and colder than the most biting of winds.

"You have examined her yourself, Severus. Surely you do not believe second years to be capable---"

"I have no doubt the fools never orchestrated the thing themselves. More likely, they carried out the instructions of another or acted indirectly. It may be that Weasley and Granger were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time," his lip curled in a way that made it clear how likely he thought that to be, "but they have been linked to a suspicious set of circumstances. If they are so innocent, I would ask why they were absent from the feast tonight?"

Hermione's mouth opened, but her tongue failed to form the words. She was frozen, just as she had been when the two of them and Neville had landed in the Devil's Snare. 

Ron cleared his throat. "We... uh, we were at Nick's deathday party?"

"Who the hell's what now?" Aberforth asked gruffly.

"Uh... Nearly-Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost?"

"Oh, him. Yes, I know the one. Now, what in the seven hells is a deathday party?"

"The celebration of the day a ghost passed on," squeaked Professor Flitwick. "Most of them don't celebrate, but some do for special occasions."

"This was his six-hundredth," Hermione piped up in a small voice much higher than usual. Ron thought it a miracle she had found her voice at all.

"I am most jealous," said Snape, "I'm sure such an illustrious occasion must have been... exhilarating. It must really have made you feel... alive." His lip curled once more. "Yet, despite the majesties of such a gathering, I doubt ghosts serve food fit for the living. Tell me, why is it you did not return to the feast in time to ensure the two of you did not go to bed hungry?"

Ron looked at the floor and he could feel the heat of his blush as he muttered something about losing track of time.

"Typical," drawled Snape. "I suppose the ghosts neglected to splurge on a clock for the occasion?"

"I don't care about some stupid ghost party!" Filch had found his voice again and his face was flushed so red that Ron thought steam might billow from his ears at any moment. "I want to hear about my cat!"

"Oh, shut it, you old fool!" snapped Aberforth, turning to his brother. "Can we heal the damn cat so he can shut his mouth and get out of our sight?"

"I believe we can, but it will not be tonight. Mandrake Draught should be sufficient but ours are still maturing and they are extremely rare. I doubt finding any will be a viable option, let alone affording them."

"Our Mandrakes won't be ready to harvest for months," said Sprout. "May or June, I would guess."

Filch looked catatonic and couldn't so much as speak. "I will make inquiries," Dumbledore promised, though Ron could tell he was not optimistic. "If I do manage to acquire the appropriate potion, I will ensure your precious Mrs. Norris is restored to you at once."

"What of Weasley and Granger?" asked Snape. "Guilty or not, they should have been present at the feast or at least informed their Head of House. Need I remind you, Headmaster, that they would likely have been arrested for their part in the dragon fiasco last May had you not begged the Department of Magical Law Enforcement for their pardon?"

"Would you have seen children judged by the same sword as men?" Snape's expression gave nothing away. "They are children, and like all children, they must learn." Dumbledore turned to the both of them. "You will each serve a detention for your poor communication. Professor Snape is most correct. Leave from the feast should have been requested. At the very least, you should have made Professor McGonagall aware of your absence."

"You-you don't think we hurt Mrs. Norris?" Hermione's voice trembled, but she just barely managed to lift her head enough to meet Dumbledore's eyes.

His expression was pensive as he met Hermione's gaze. "No, Miss Granger, I do not. Bright as you may be, I think this is leagues above your current set of capabilities. The same goes for Master Weasley. I will make an announcement on the morrow clearing you both of any accusations so that the school might not give you such a hard time. I fear it may not completely subvert the undeserved blame, but it is the best I can offer. I apologize if this causes you any problems." He glanced at the clock on the wall. "Your house will doubtlessly be waiting. Minerva, do escort them and make the Gryffindors aware of their innocence."

"Of course, Albus," said McGonagall, leading the both of them from the room. Ron could only breathe a silent sigh of relief as soon as the door closed behind them.

***November 1, 1992***

***An Abandoned Classroom ***

***10:32 PM***

The night the writing had appeared on the wall had been a very tense one in Slytherin House. Harry had watched the way that many of the older students cast veiled glances around at one another and wondered what they all meant. He had contemplated seeking out Diana. Despite his divide with Draco, she had remained all too willing to answer his questions. He couldn't find her though, nor could he see her brother anywhere. He wondered if the two of them were off somewhere. Perhaps Diana was criticizing him for the mudblood comment. Many of the older Slytherins were mocking him for it in quiet whispers --- Daphne had done likewise. Harry couldn't disagree that it made him look extremely suspicious, but he still didn't think Draco was capable of such a feat.

Most in the house went to bed early that night, though Harry suspected many didn't fall asleep for quite some time. The next morning was a Saturday and curfew was lifted, leaving the students to go about their days as normal. Dumbledore absolved Weasley and Granger of any guilt at breakfast and announced a full sweep of the castle had been carried out. Nothing at all out of the ordinary had been found, and things would proceed as normal.

Harry spent much of the day in the library, though he did practice combat magic with Cassie as well. He couldn't wait for the day when their Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor might finally give up their detentions. He often went straight from lessons with Cassie to the detentions and Harry was just plain sick of them by now.

He let out all of his pent up frustration at Aberforth and the situation in one long, deep breath as he stepped from the man's office and began making his way down into the dungeons. Instead of heading to the common room, Harry stopped a bit short in a corridor full of serpentine decor not far from the room where Slytherin dwelled. He glanced quickly around to make sure no one was nearby before he leant into the wall and whispered a command that escaped from his mouth in a rasping hiss.

**"Open."**

The wall slid noiselessly aside, allowing him to step into the hidden passage before it closed just as silently behind him. 

Since coming to the revelation at Malfoy Manor that speaking Parseltongue was a very unique gift, Harry's imagination had wandered. There were a plentiful number of snakes in the dungeons. Carvings, portraits, implements in the shape of them, and even the occasional living one dwelling in the cracks of the ancient stone walls and floors. His curiosity had been piqued when he'd thought back to the London Zoo. The boa constrictor had not just heard him, it had listened. He had wondered whether or not all these snakes would do the same. Thus far, the results had been very much to his satisfaction.

Some of the decor was indeed enchanted, it seemed, to hide hidden passages that only Parselmouths could access. Harry had found three so far, but he wondered whether or not there were more. All three of them had been found in the dead of night whilst he crept around under his invisibility cloak. He wouldn't be risking speaking to snakes in broad daylight. Not without a very good reason, at least. Between Slytherin himself and people like Voldemort long after him, the language had a dark and despised reputation in Magical Britain.

This passage was a shortcut that led much deeper into the dungeons. There were actually a couple of exits from the hidden tunnel he had not yet explored, but it ended in a wall that would slide open just like the entrance on the other side. It allowed the user to traverse a great distance of the dungeons in a very short amount of time. When Harry came out on the other side, he strode towards the nearest classroom and knocked twelve times.

Millicent opened the door almost at once and stepped aside, allowing Harry in. It was a simple abandoned classroom. A number of desks had been pulled back into the middle of the room from where they had been stacked along the walls to allow Daphne, Blaise, Tracey, and Lillian to sit, with spots open for Harry and Millicent.

"How was detention?" Tracey asked with a sly smirk. Harry hadn't told any of them what Aberforth had him do in those detentions, but they all knew how poor a mood they left him in.

"Like the rest of them," he spat, looking at Daphne. "What's up, Daphne? I usually just call it a night after these detentions. What had you so hung up on a meeting?"

"Last night." Harry grew curious at once. He remembered the look in her eyes when they had seen the writing. As though she had solved some great puzzle, but also full of wariness and apprehension. 

"You know what it means?"

"I know what whoever wrote on the wall was getting at. They might be bluffing. It seems a bit too much to believe from someone still in school, but I suppose it's not impossible."

"You know what is impossible?" Tracey asked no one in particular. "Any of us knowing what you're on about unless you get to the point."

A smile played at the corner of Daphne's lips. "Patience is important, Tracey. You should learn it at some point." She turned to the rest of them. "Do you all remember what was written on the wall?"

"Hard not to," said Lillian. "I've heard the professors still haven't figured out how to remove it."

"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened," Harry quoted. "Enemies of the Heir, beware."

"Have you ever read *Hogwarts, A History*, Harry?" asked Daphne.

"Some of it," he answered. He had read a bit of it before his first year, and then some more of the book as the year went on. He had become altogether distracted by learning magic, however, so he had never finished it. 

"How much do you know about the Hogwarts founders?"

He shrugged. "Not a lot. Slytherin was a Parselmouth and the first in Britain who could speak to snakes. Gryffindor was bold and used to duel wizards with wands and muggles with a sword for the fun of it. Hufflepuff was kind and I think she was the one who brought house elves to Hogwarts. Ravenclaw was brilliant and the rumour is that her tiara, or whatever it's called, makes the person who wears it smarter."

"Diadem, but yes," said Daphne, "that's basically all correct. There's a lot more, but only one bit is really relevant."

Harry looked around to see if anyone else knew what she was talking about. It was hard to tell, but he thought Bulstrode might have. The rest seemed as clueless as he felt. 

"After a few years of working in peace," Daphne began, "Gryffindor and Slytherin started to argue. They argued over muggleborns; whether or not they should be allowed at Hogwarts. Gryffindor said everyone should have the chance to learn magic, and Slytherin said the risks were too high."

"The risks?" asked Harry.

"Muggle religion was on the rise in England," said Daphne. "The muggles were starting to do horrible things to the witches and wizards they found. Things I doubt any of us can imagine."

Harry shuddered involuntarily and hoped that none of them could spot it. He could see blood running over snow like a fast-flowing river filled to the brim with crimson water. He could see a frail body lying lifeless and somehow flat, and he could see the horrible ooze pouring from Wylla Nurmen's skull; like a thick and chunky soup. He could imagine what the muggles might do better than Daphne could ever hope to realize.

"Is this where the blood supremacy stuff comes from?"

Daphne exchanged looks with Millicent and Lillian. "It's... a big part of it, yes. Muggles didn't exactly treat wizards well. We were stoned, burnt alive, hung, tortured, and all kinds of things for centuries. The Statute of Secrecy put a stop to it, but before that, it wasn't easy for witches and wizards to walk around freely without a muggle trying to persecute them. It's not the only reason blood supremacy exists, but it's definitely a part of it."

Harry managed to suppress the shudder this time. The words rang true with him. All he had been through and all Grindelwald had been through spoke the same horrible truth. Even Voldemort's monologue in the third-floor corridor lined up. He had spoken passionately about muggles and their inherent need to destroy anything they failed to understand.

"We're off-topic, though," Daphne continued. "Eventually, the argument between Gryffindor and Slytherin got so bad that Salazar left the school." She paused. "That's where it gets interesting. That much is known fact, but rumours have been floating around for centuries about Slytherin. All kinds of them, actually, but one of them claims he left a monster somewhere in a hidden chamber at Hogwarts. Some people say only his true heir can find the chamber and unleash the monster. Most seem to think, if it exists, that Salazar hoped his heir would find it and use it to kill all of the school's muggleborns. I find that part to be ridiculous, but the monster isn't totally out of the question."

"It's... not?" asked Harry. "Isn't that a little... far-fetched?"

"Slytherin was paranoid," said Lillian. "We don't know much about him, but we know that. Also spiteful... he didn't like losing."

"There's a reason one of Slytherin's key traits is ambition," Daphne said with a smile that stretched to her eyes.

"But... surely it would have been found by now, right?" 

"Who knows?" asked Millicent. "Maybe only Slytherin's family can get into it. Maybe you need to prove you're related. There are doors and stuff that won't happen without blood."

"Blood magic, yes," said Daphne. "One of the most complicated and powerful branches of magic that exist. It is extremely illegal, but it wasn't at that time."

Blaise snorted. "I'm sure Salazar kept a pamphlet of all the laws of the world beside his bed at all times. It was his easy reading material before bed, I would wager."

Daphne was trying and failing to look annoyed at the interruption. She was laughing just like the rest of them. "The point is, there are ways it could have been done. That's what whoever wrote on the wall meant by the Chamber of Secrets. Enemies of the Heir must mean the muggleborns --- and maybe the blood traitors, too."

That was an interesting point, Harry realized. He had no idea as to Daphne's stance on blood supremacy or traditionalism. Her family was one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight and a Founding House to boot. That and her casual usage of the term blood traitor made him think she was at least a traditionalist. On the other hand, Davis was not a noble family --- though Tracey had said she was a pureblood --- and Harry himself was only a halfblood. If she did prescribe to the blood supremacist agenda, she was definitely one of the cause's more reasonable and less radical patrons. 

Harry found himself extremely curious. He thought about the ways Parseltongue caused some of the snake carvings and the like to obey him. What if that was the way to find the Chamber of Secrets? What if one of those doors in the passage he had used to speed up the trek here led right into it? Or what if it was just hidden behind another passage he had yet to find? 

He was almost curious enough to go looking, but two things stopped him.

The last time he had recklessly given into his curiosity had been the night after his final exam last year. The night he had waited for Weasley, Granger, and Longbottom to return from their trek down the third-floor corridor. That had been the night he had come face-to-face with the Dark Lord, and it was the night that Neville Longbottom had died because of his actions. He had promised himself he would be more careful after that, and even more so after he had been portkeyed straight into Nurmengard. 

There was another thing, too.

*"There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year. Dobby has known it for months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is too important, sir!"*

The elf's warning rang through his hair like the clattering of bells as he frowned deeply. 

Had Dobby known about the Chamber of Secrets? It seemed impossible, but it made sense. A petrification that not even Dumbledore could explain certainly fit the bill. Dobby had even said that there were powers even Dumbledore didn't possess.

That was enough to discourage Harry. If Dobby had known the right of it, even back on the first of September, then he likely knew more. If he thought Harry shouldn't put himself in harm's way, Harry was inclined to listen --- especially after the incidents that capped off his first year at Hogwarts.

Though all of this did raise an interesting question and a worrying possibility.

How had Dobby known about the Chamber of Secrets and did this mean Draco really could be responsible for the whole thing? Had his loud proclamation been a frame job after all? Harry couldn't see how the boy might have acted whilst feasting in the Great hall, but there were many things he didn't know. Perhaps he could have summoned Dobby and had him do it. Or paid an older student --- the Malfoys had no shortage of disposable gold. It fit with his vicious mood, too; a mood that had only worsened since Harry's split from him and his group.

Harry shivered as he remembered Daphne's words about how the Malfoys had used him as a tool. He remembered all the suspicious things that pointed to the fact she may well have been right and suddenly, Harry wondered exactly what he may or may not have gotten himself into. Merlin, this was all so confusing. He hated every bit of it.

***November 7, 1992***

***The Slytherin Changing Room***

***8:56 AM***

Waves of noise seemed to crash against the changing room's outer walls like water slamming against a rocky shore. It reminded Harry of the night Hagrid had found him and the storm that had raged outside all the while.

The walls suppressed the noise enough that none inside could hear anything that was being said. Or perhaps that had less to do with the walls and more to do with the fact that there were just so many voices. It was a constant, indiscernible drone that the walls barely quieted.

Harry was grateful for that at least. It was to be his first-ever Quidditch match and he could not remember a time he had felt so sick. The day he had sat atop a spindle-legged stool and been sorted into Slytherin House was the closest comparison that he could come up with offhandedly. There was just so much riding on this game.

Tensions had been at an all-time high within the castle; it was like the very halls were at war. One wearing either green or silver robes never knew what might await them around each and every corner. Harry was told that the week or so leading up to any Quidditch match between the two rival houses was wrought with tension and conflict, but the horrors of Samhain had added another depth to this particular clash.

The school was in a state of disarray and Harry had never seen the houses so divided. Almost the whole of Slytherin House had been loudly parading around the castle preaching to anyone who would listen that it had been the blood traitor Weasley and the mudblood Granger who had petrified Filch's cat. They had not been at the feast, Slytherins would say, and the two of them had valid reasons to detest the house of the snake. Especially considering the way Draco had gotten them into such trouble last May and the incident on the Quidditch pitch earlier that year. If you asked any Slytherin worth their green and silver robes, they would tell you that it was a poorly attempted frame job in the hopes of tarnishing Slytherin's reputation or maybe even getting one of its members falsely expelled.

The Gryffindors saw things quite differently. They all seemed to universally defend Weasley and Granger. Weasley was scarcely seen without some sort of honour guard nowadays. It appeared that Oliver Wood had put many of the older students up to following the red-headed second year like preying vultures.

Yet the Gryffindors went beyond simply protecting their own. They seemed to have taken Slytherin's accusations as an open challenge. More duels had broken out that week in the halls than Harry could count. The Weasley twins had been especially vicious. Their various antics had left no less than eight Slytherins in the hospital wing. Of course, no one had proven they had been involved in any of them thus far, but Harry thought it was glaringly obvious to anyone with a working brain and a set of eyes.

Flint had seen the way Weasley was guarded so carefully and mimicked the gesture with the younger players of the Slytherin team. This had led to a number of very awkward walks to classes and the like during which Harry and Draco had stood scant metres apart. Neither of them had said a word on any of these occasions, but Harry felt as though he was suffocating each and every time.

The Hufflepuffs and the Ravenclaws were as divided as ever, but neither house seemed to want anything to do with the mess. Harry couldn't blame them. He wanted nothing to do with it himself. He hoped the match was going to be fun, but it surely wouldn't be worth needing to glance over his shoulder at all hours of the day.

The bitter rivalry had elevated this particular match's importance. As the seeker, Harry knew that better than anyone. He had lost count of the number of Slytherins who had approached him over the week. Most of them had told him, in one way or another, that he had better win the match. Some of them were much kinder about it than others --- some went as far as to make outright threats.

Not only would losing the match give Gryffindor an edge in the ruthless back and forth their houses were locked in, but Harry feared it may put him right back into a compromising position. He had enjoyed his peace ever since falling in with Daphne and her group of friends, except for the morning when someone had decided to send him an envelope full of bubotuber pus. Daphne still vowed that she would find the culprit, for she was sure it had been a Hogwarts student. Unfortunately, she had been unsuccessful.

Her presence in particular offered him a certain degree of protection against the bigots in the upper years. He hoped that through his gruelling nights practicing with Cassie, he would be able to defend himself from any upper year in the school before too long, but he wasn't unrealistic in his expectations. Harry hoped that day would come soon, but he knew its arrival was still a long time away. Worse was the worry that Daphne's presence would not be enough to dissuade the upper years if Harry allowed Ron Weasley to beat him to the snitch.

And if all of that had not been enough, Snape had apparently seen fit to add to his stress the day before.

***The previous day, in the Potions Classroom...***

The class had been a complete and total disaster. Many in the dungeon were still choking. Horrid purple smoke had flowed through the room fast as a swiftly blowing wind not seconds earlier, but Snape had vanished it soon after it had appeared. Harry had seen how it had happened and was only grateful it had not been him on the receiving end of Weasley's sabotage. The boy had thrown... something into Draco's cauldron. There had been an explosion that had caused a violent reaction that melted the cauldron into a twisted glob of molten pewter on the floor while the toxic-smelling fumes wafted into the air like columns of billowing steam.

Harry had been glaring at Weasley in the beginning, but something nagged at him. He felt... something. A gentle nudge at the corners of his mind. It was not unlike how Dumbledore had described a Legilimency attack. Not that Harry would know for himself. He was not yet adept enough for Dumbledore to truly test him with those attacks, but the time would come soon enough.

He turned his head to the right on instinct alone and saw it. The hem of robes disappearing as their owner stepped into Snape's office. His eyes narrowed as he carefully watched the door until Hermione Granger stepped out a few minutes later, unnoticed by most of the class.

"What is she up to?" Daphne muttered from beside him. Whether she had spotted Granger herself or simply noticed where her partner had been looking, Harry did not know.

"No idea," he answered. "It was definitely set up, though."

Daphne looked at him as though he were a slow child. "I'm not Crabbe or Goyle," she told him. "You don't need to lay out things to me that are as obvious as the sun rising in the east and setting in the west."

Harry fought against the flush that rose to his cheeks as Snape finished vanishing whatever Weasley had sent up into the air from Draco's cauldron. Harry and Daphne were about as far as they could get from Draco whilst still remaining on the Slytherin's side of the classroom, so they were mostly unaffected.

"Potter!" Snape called minutes later and right before the class was set to end. "Stay behind!"

Harry almost sighed aloud. Snape had been far from pleasant last year. He had showered every Slytherin not named Harry Potter with points every time they so much as breathed, it seemed, yet Harry had not been awarded a point all year. It was true that Potions was not his best subject, but he had always been adequate. He had brewed many potions better than others who were awarded points for their efforts, but Snape had ignored him each and every time. After that first day, that seemed to have been his policy regarding Harry in general. It was better than outright torment, but it had left a bitter taste in the then first year's mouth.

This year, things had only become worse. Snape seemed to have developed a vendetta against Harry over the summer. He could not imagine why. He didn't know why Snape had disliked him in the first place, but this was a whole different thing altogether. And why? He had never done anything to anger Snape. He had done his best to keep his head down around the man, if anything, and his reward had been venomous glares, poisoned words, and a partnership with a boy who had been meant to be his undoing before Daphne had basically rescued him from that predicament.

Harry felt apprehension rise within him once the bell rang and the room began to thin. It was the first time he had been alone with Snape since the Potion Master's sudden change of heart towards him.

"You asked me to stay behind, sir?"

Snape looked up from the vial he was studying and sneered at him. "Do not ask me questions you already know the answer to, Potter. You may be plagued by a countless number of personal flaws, but you are no half-wit and I believe your hearing is perfectly adequate."

Harry ground his teeth together. "Yes, sir."

Snape studied him. "How do you feel, Potter?"

Harry startled at the question, nearly losing the grip he had on his school bag. "Sir?"

"I said, how do you feel, Potter?"

"I'm... all right, sir."

"Tomorrow, you will need to be more than all right. I will not have you embarrassing Slytherin House out on the Quidditch pitch." His expression darkened. "Your father was a pathetic braggart with a head bigger than Hagrid, but Quidditch was the one area in which James Potter lived up to his boasting. I expect you to be every bit as magnificent tomorrow as he ever was." Their eyes met. "I will be... most displeased if you do not live up to my expectations."

Harry resisted the urge to gulp. "I understand, sir."

"Dismissed," said the Potions Master, waving his hand and returning to the vial he had been studying before Harry had drawn his attention.

***Back in the present...***

All of it was a weight on his shoulders so heavy that Harry felt like his knees would buckle the second he rose to his feet. Most around him looked every bit as anxious as he was. Draco had not raised his stare from the floor since he had entered the room. He was running a hand up and down his Nimbus 2001 in a way that was almost rhythmic. Cassius's foot was tapping faster and faster on the changing room's floor as the game drew closer and his eyes were fixed upon the wall in front of him. Derrick and Bole were both stretching, but as they did, Harry noticed a great deal of tension within them. Flint was stone-faced but resolute, and Miles Bletchley was pacing about the room like a caged animal itching to be loosed.

The oppressive tension hanging in the air like precipitation was such that Harry could hardly believe it had not blasted the changing room's door from its hinges yet. Surely this room could not contain all of it.

And then, they heard it.

"WELCOME, EVERYONE, TO THE OPENING MATCH OF THE 1992--1993 HOGWARTS QUIDDITCH SEASON BETWEEN GRYFFINDOR AND SLYTHERIN!"

Lee Jordan's magically amplified voice was muffled by the walls, like the rest of the noise, but they had no trouble making out every word. The unanimous roar of approval from the crowd penetrated the room just as effectively and Harry could feel his heart begin to quicken. It was as though his heart was but a drum and the cry of the audience had been the cue for the drummer to begin playing a song that required an unreasonably fast cadence as he beat upon the instrument.

"Everybody up." Flint's voice was as unyielding as iron. He might not have been one for pre-match speeches, but when Marcus Flint spoke, people listened.

The team took to their feet and arranged themselves in a single-file line facing the changing room's exit, which Flint opened with a wave of his wand. Jordan was introducing the Gryffindor team. Harry saw the looks of twisted bitterness and poorly masked fury on many of his teammates' faces when the lions were introduced as the defending champions. Last year had been the first in more than half a decade in which Slytherin had not captured the Quidditch cup.

The lions' team was unchanged from the previous year. Their captain would still man the goals, the Weasley twins were still the most terrifying pair of beaters Hogwarts had seen in years, Johnson, Bell, and Spinnet were presumably still the well-oiled machine Harry had remembered, and Ron Weasley was still the boy who had been the youngest seeker in a century. It was going to take a Herculean effort to take down the Gryffindors --- Nimbus 2001s or not.

"AND NOW," called Lee Jordan, "I PRESENT TO YOU THE SLYTHERIN QUIDDITCH TEAM! BLETCHLEY, BOLE, DERRICK, MALFOY, WARRINGTON, FLINT, AND POTTER!"

The wind slammed into Harry with enough force to snap his head back as he soared out the changing room. The feeling of acceleration on a broomstick was among his favourite sensations in the world. There was a moment when his stomach seemed to fall from his body and his heart leaped up to his throat. It was one of the things Harry enjoyed the most and he no longer found himself nervous about the game to come.

The teams were lined up at centrefield in short order. Harry watched as Wood and Flint seemed to try and break the other's hand. He never understood why captains bothered exerting the energy for such things. If one of them ever actually managed the feat, Harry thought he may reconsider his stance.

The whistle's blast cut through the morning air like a sharp-edged sword. Harry rocketed skywards once more and immediately realized he had the advantage over Weasley --- who had been glaring at him as though Harry had done something personally offensive to his mother or some nonsense. He and Weasley didn't even particularly dislike each other; best as Harry could tell, the boy was just a Gryffindor who had the house's typical competitive streak.

His broom rose faster than Weasley's, but he had to dodge a bludger almost immediately . The dodge wasn't difficult, but it did divert his path. Harry was grateful for it. Being struck by a bludger at high speeds had been one of the things Harry had been most worried about when he had begun to properly practice Quidditch. To have the first dodge out of the way so early was nice; he knew that he could avoid them now.

He heard something whistling through the air towards him and rolled on instinct alone. The same bludger sped past him. Harry saw it invert in the air this time before rocketing back towards him. His eyes widened. What in Merlin's name was going on?

He dodged once more and flew towards his beaters at top speed. Derrick and Bole had seen him by now and knew what he was doing. Harry flew straight past them, leading the bludger into a well-placed strike with the bat. Harry sighed, happy to finally have a break.

"What in the hell?" he heard Derrick shout and all of a sudden, he was dodging again.

"Somebody's fucked with the bludger!" called Bole.

Harry knew at once that it was true. Bludgers weren't supposed to focus on any one player. They were not supposed to hone in on a target, but try and unseat any player within striking range. Harry was not the most well-read player on the pitch in regards to Quidditch, but he had never heard of anything like this happening. He wondered whether or not it might be some sort of plot by one of the upper years. Perhaps it was even the same student who had sent him the bubotuber pus. He had no idea how hard it was to enchant something like a bludger. He imagined it was a bit above fourth-year level magic or he might have suspected the Weasley twins. Something so outlandish and ill-thought would have perfectly matched the tone of all their other antics during the past week or so since Mrs. Norris had turned up petrified.

Harry jerked his broom up and shot skywards. He flew high above the pitch, dodging the bludger at each and every turn as he scanned for any sign of the elusive golden snitch. He was a good flyer, he knew, but he was beginning to see how this game would play out. The bludger would follow him at all costs and eventually, he would tire. Fatigue tended to lead to mistakes, and Harry could not afford to make one.

Derrick and Bole were both pursuing the bludger and doing their best to keep it away from Harry, but they were only partially successful. They did manage to knock it away for a moment, which gave Harry time to scan the pitch. It was a bright and cloudless morning. The sun shone down and caused the dew far below to sparkle on the grass like liquid diamonds. It reflected the sunlight in all sorts of ways that would make finding the snitch an absolute bitch if it was too close to the ground. Harry would have to hope it flew high, especially because Weasley seemed to be playing as something like a fourth chaser. The Gryffindors probably suspected his chances of catching the snitch with his beaters and the bludger impeding his path to be slim at best. Why not run up the score before their own seeker made the easiest catch of his life? It made too much sense --- enough that Harry signalled to Flint at the first available opportunity. The captain mercifully heeded his plea and called for a time out.

Harry had been the highest in the sky and had to avoid the bludger on his way down, so he was the last to land. The thing tried to behead him even when Harry stepped off of his broom, but Bole tackled it out of the air. He was grunting and Harry could hear him scrambling every few seconds as he tried his best to pin the bludger down.

They were drawing attention from the crowd now. Those who had not yet realized the bludger seemed to be in a murderous rage were seeing it now.

Flint seemed unphased. "What is it, Potter?"

"The bludger is trying to kill me."

"Make it work," said Flint. "I won't have us losing this match. Not when we have better brooms and not with everything that's at stake. If we lose this after all that's happened, it's going to be a nightmare."

Harry didn't know why the words stung so fiercely. It was like Flint had slapped him across the face on the coldest day of winter. He should not have been surprised. Marcus Flint was not known for his kindness, especially to those born of anything less than the purest of unions.

"If you want me to win the damn match, tell Derrick and Bole to leave me alone. I'm wasting my time trying to catch the snitch if they just keep getting in the way."

"Don't be an idiot," snapped Cassius, "that thing will kill you."

"Not if I can catch the stupid snitch quickly."

"With a bludger chasing you the whole game?"

Harry stuck up his chin in his best imitation of Draco. The blond watched him interact with the rest quietly. His expression gave nothing away and he made no move to speak.

"You're the one who told me I would be good enough to make the team," Harry reminded Cassius. "I'm either good enough, or I'm not."

"Or you can just stop this madness!"

"Are you suggesting we forfeit, Warrington?" Flint's eyes sparkled with something deadly as he stared down Cassius.

Harry's older friend did not so much as flinch. "Look, I like Harry more than anyone on this team. If he manages to prove me wrong, all the more power to him, but I don't see how he can catch the snitch with the bludger trying to kill him. That just lets Weasley play chaser and our brooms don't make up for being a man down. We're already down by thirty, Flint, and we both know it's going to get worse if something doesn't change fast. Better to give it up now and keep all of our players alive."

"Where's your ambition, Warrington?"

Cassius ground his teeth together. "You want to lecture me about Slytherin traits, Flint? Use that brain of yours and stop acting like a Gryffindor. There's more to being in Slytherin and living life than not losing. It's called a tactical retreat for a reason."

"No!" Both boys looked sharply at Harry; Cassius looked as though he might burst with frustration at any moment. "I'm not forfeiting." He worried what would happen in Slytherin if he lost the match. He did not want to imagine what might become of him and his status if they *forfeited* because of *him*. That would be an entirely different level of vitriol; one he wasn't sure he was equipped to deal with. "Call off Derrick and Bole," he told Flint. "At least let me try and win this."

"And don't worry about Weasley." It was Draco who had spoken. Harry looked at him properly for the first time that day. He recognized that look in his former friend's eyes; it was the same look he had worn before goading Weasley into the midnight duel and the same look he had worn the morning after Hagrid had been caught smuggling the dragon. "I have a plan for him."

"Gentlemen!" Madam Hooch's voice brought them all back to the present. "Are you all ready to resume?"

"We are," said Flint before Cassius could get in another word. He cast glances towards both Derrick and Bole. "Leave Potter alone. Deal with the chasers and Weasley the best you can."

Cassius was seething by the time they took to the air again. Harry wondered what his friends thought of what was going on from their view in the stands but he had no time to consider the matter --- the bludger was on him again.

Harry evaded once, twice, three times as he shot skywards. He wondered if this was how the birds near the Black Lake felt in the warmer months of the year when students pelted them with any number of things to make them go away.

It was more exhausting now than it had been before. Flying a broom may not have taken great deals of energy, but the constant leaning from one side to the other while maintaining his grip was beginning to wear on Harry. His fingers were growing sore from how hard he had been clutching the broom not to fall off and his back was beginning to stiffen. Probably from throwing his body from one side to the other so recklessly and so often.

Weasley dove back down towards the cluster of chasers below, clearly intent on rejoining the play. Harry saw Draco waving at the crowd while he passed the quaffle to Cassius. Harry seethed for a moment. He could not imagine why Draco was gloating while Slytherin was trailing the lions, but he didn't have much time to dwell on his annoyance; the bludger was coming again.

A din of noise began to rise from the crowd as he evaded another attempt at his life. The sound wafted up into the air, but it didn't quite reach Harry, so far he was above the stands. He debated diving down, but the bludger was coming in again and the chant was rising. It must have been started by a smaller contingent and picked up by others, for soon, Harry could hear every word of it without fail.

"Weasley cannot catch the snitch

He flies all round and round the pitch

As good a seeker as he's rich,

Weasley is our favourite witch!

Weasley was born in a bin,

He doesn't let the riff-raff in,

Weasley will make sure we win,

Weasley is our King!

Weasley is our King!

Weasley is our King!

He doesn't let the riff-raff in,

Weasley is our King!"

His jaw nearly fell agape.

The first few choruses of the song were sung mostly by the younger Slytherins. First, second, and third years screamed every syllable as though they were using their dying breath, but many of the upper years clearly hadn't heard it yet. After a certain number of rounds, however, each and every single member of Slytherin House seemed to be screaming the words for all to hear.

"Weasley cannot catch the snitch

He flies all round and round the pitch

As good a seeker as he's rich,

Weasley is our favourite witch!

Weasley was born in a bin,

He doesn't let the riff-raff in,

Weasley will make sure we win,

Weasley is our King!

Weasley is our King!

Weasley is our King!

He doesn't let the riff-raff in,

Weasley is our King!"

This was Draco's work, Harry knew. The bit about Weasley being born in a bin was straight from the youngest Malfoy's playbook and the line about being a witch was much too juvenile to have been devised by an upper year.

But there was some cunning hidden behind the childish jabs.

He doesn't let the riff-raff in...

It was brilliant, in its own way. Many at the school thought Weasley the culprit from Samhain and it bothered both him and his house immensely. Anybody who knew the story of the Chamber of Secrets would know exactly what was being implied.

It was clear that Weasley knew, for the quaffle flew amiss when he tried to pass to Katie Bell. Seekers could handle the quaffle without issue; most of them just chose not to because of the risks. Seeing as Harry had spent the better part of the match trying not to die, he could hardly blame Weasley for thinking it an opportune game to play as offensively as he wished.

Weasley tried to intercept a pass from Draco to Flint, but he hadn't been watching Angelina Johnson try to do the same thing. The two of them collided hard. Harry could see a thin trickle of blood flowing from Weasley's nose as he disentangled himself from his chaser. The blood seemed to paint a line of crimson in the air as it flowed towards the ground below. Weasley had seen it, too. He froze at the sight of it, and that was when Harry saw the sparkle of gold.

It was closer to Weasley than it was to him, but he could not afford to wait. He had been moving through the air as though he was performing some sort of choreographed dance on his broomstick. It had been the only way to avoid the bludger and fatigue was well and truly setting in now. He needed to catch the snitch or he would not be staying on his broom for long.

He dove, adding a line of green and silver to the world's morning canvas as he shot towards the ground like an emerald arrow with a black tip where his hair fanned out in the wind. Weasley only saw him diving when the distance between Harry and the snitch had closed. Harry saw out of the corner of his eye Weasley wheel his broom about and fly towards the snitch. It was going to be close; Weasley was closer but Harry had the faster broom. He was closing fast, but not fast enough. Weasley was going to get it, he was about to reach for it, the match would be over at any moment...

"Weasley cannot catch the snitch

He flies all round and round the pitch

As good a seeker as he's rich,

Weasley is our favourite witch!

Weasley was born in a bin,

He doesn't let the riff-raff in,

Weasley will make sure we win,

Weasley is our King!

Weasley is our King!

Weasley is our King!

He doesn't let the riff-raff in,

Weasley is our King!"

The snitch floated through Weasley's fumbling fingers and Harry leant so far forward on his broom, he feared he might fall.

His fears proved themselves well founded.

The bludger slammed into his shoulder from behind. Harry heard the crunch of bone giving way against the flying ball's concussive force and he felt weightless as he fell, but there had been another sensation just seconds before. The feeling of metal against his palm and the rush of victory as his fingers had snatched the snitch from right under Weasley's nose as he fumbled aimlessly, desperately trying to remedy the mistake that would cost him his first-ever loss out on the Quidditch pitch.

Harry hit the ground so hard that he felt other things give way. His ribs seemed to ripple beneath his skin as though they weren't held in place and his lungs contracted as air was torn ruthlessly from his body. Everything ached as black spots danced before his eyes. The last thought Harry had before falling to unconsciousness was that he wasn't sure which bothered him more --- the searing pain in his ribs, shoulder, arm, and chest, or the mousy-haired boy running forward and taking pictures so fast that Harry thought the camera might explode.

***That night, in the hospital wing...***

All was dark when Harry next woke. He cast his eyes around the room, but he wore no glasses. They had been removed at some point whilst he was sleeping. His whole body did not just ache, but it burned and the skin itched. He reached over to scratch his arm, but he recoiled his hand at once. The bones under his skin felt... wrong. It was not a solid mass, but separate and disjointed pieces that moved under his skin at the barest touch. His mind flashed back to the bits of bone floating inside the soup-like substance contained within Wylla Nurmen's skull after the stoning and he very nearly vomited.

Fortunately he didn't, for footsteps could be heard within seconds of his waking. He thought at first that it must be Madam Pomfrey coming to check on him. He fumbled quietly for his glasses and found them before the footsteps drew too near. Jamming them onto his face, he rolled over so he could act as though he was sleeping, but his eyes were open just enough to see what was going on.

Even in the dark, there was no mistaking Dumbledore's silvery beard. It shone nearly as brightly as the castle ghosts and there was a certain air about the Headmaster that was just impossible to ignore. It was hard to see whilst squinting, but Harry thought the figure who followed him into the room was Professor McGonagall.

Then, he saw the other body. It was floating in the air as if it was on an invisible stretcher. Harry had to try hard not to gasp --- he could not tell whether the motionless figure was alive or dead.

"Get Madam Pomfrey," Dumbledore whispered and the other made off towards the matron's office.

The body had been levitated onto one of the other beds by the time McGonagall and Pomfrey returned. "Dear Merlin," breathed the matron, "what happened?"

"We think he was sneaking up to see Potter," said McGonagall, holding up a small basket of sweets. "These were beside him and he was seen trying to follow Potter up to the hospital wing. The boy was unconscious, but still he wanted to take his pictures and say his words."

"Let us not forget about this." Dumbledore spoke softly as he held up Colin Creevey's camera, but Harry could hear the note of tension in the old man's voice. He opened the camera but almost immediately dropped it. A thick cloud of billowing smoke rose from it. It filled the room and seemed to thicken the very air. Breathing was altogether more difficult for a moment before the smoke had been dispersed.

"Merlin's beard," said McGonagall, her voice nearly impossible to hear. "It's... melted." Harry could not see from his vantage point, but he could only assume she was talking about the film. "Albus... what does this mean?"

Dumbledore did not answer for a moment. Harry thought he could feel the Headmaster's eyes on him, but he was now looking in the other direction and very much hoped he was imagining it.

"It means," said Dumbledore, "that the Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened once again."

Harry found sleep did not come easily after that revelation. Much of the school had outright dismissed the possibility of the Chamber of Secrets actually being open once more, but Harry felt more inclined to believe Dumbledore than any of them. It made him uneasy to think that it could well be one of his housemates. The type to do such things seemed exactly like those who had been trying to make his life a living hell before he had befriended Daphne. For all he knew, whatever the boy's name had been had only been petrified on the way to the hospital because the Heir of Slytherin had sent the monster after Harry and the young, mousy-haired Gryffindor had gotten in the way.

It took some time before he was anywhere near ready to sleep. He had drifted in and out of the strange place between waking and sleeping since the professors had left the hospital wing. The sound of shuffling near his bed jolted him to alertness and he took special care to not move a muscle and give away his wakeful state. He listened for a minute before deciding to gather more information.

He slowly rolled over and opened his eyes. This time, his visitor did not fail to notice. A loud squeak pierced the air and the sound of running feet echoed through the hospital wing before a resounding *CRACK* took its place and all was silent.

Harry heard the matron stir in her office and rolled over once more, hoping for sleep and safety, but he was much less unaware than she would be once she reached him. He had seen the ears flap as the creature ran from the room, he had seen the battered pillowcase it wore, and he had seen its large, tennis-ball like eyes that were familiar to him.

After all, this was not the first time the Malfoys' elf had visited him before the sun had risen.

**Author's Endnote:**

**The pace of this story is going to pick up now that most of the pieces are on the board. The start of each school year can be quite cumbersome, but I am ready to begin speeding through the timeline a little bit. I did promise years with reasonable word counts, after all. This will be longer than CoS, quite obviously, but I do promise you all it won't border on anything like OotP.**

**Also, apologies for the excess of Quidditch for those who are not fans. It won't come up much, but this match was important. Also, regarding Ron, I think this should put some of your guys' fears at ease. He is not a different person in this story; he is just different because Harry isn't around him at all hours of the day. He can still crack under pressure and all the rest; the only reason he hadn't yet in Quidditch is because an eleven or twelve-year-old doesn't tend to overthink things the same way a fifteen or sixteen-year-old does.**

**Anyway, I hope you all enjoyed it.**

***March 29, 1893***

***Kirchdorf, Upper Bavaria, Germany***

***9:22 PM***

The fire crackled merrily in the corner of a small, dark room. Its warmth flowed through the space and had a calming sort of air about it. Gellert was huddled under his blanket, enjoying its warmth along with the fire. It was an unusually cold March, though the snow was finally beginning to melt. The fire and blankets offered him some reprieve from the biting chill. His father often coated the house in Warming Charms, but they only helped so much against the bitter winds that sought to slice across one's skin like a freezing razor.

Gellert had just come inside with his father. He had spent most of the day reading, but the two of them had enjoyed their time in the snow whilst they still could. It was why Gellert was so grateful for the stifling heat of the room and it was why he still shivered against his blanket.

His father, Johan, sat in a chair near his bed. The man seemed to have aged a decade in the years since he and his son had fled what was supposed to have been the site of Gellert's execution.

Gellert could understand why his father looked the way he did --- it had been a long four years. Gellert remembered nothing for several hours after the near-death experience at the church. He had fainted whilst his father apparated him away, but he had woken up in a small hut somewhere he hadn't known. Johan had taken a few of his most prized possessions from their old family home, but not many. One of which was the chair he now sat in; which he had shrunk down and later enlarged for easy carrying.

That first night had been a whirlwind. Johan had explained everything to Gellert. He had explained how he himself was a wizard capable of performing feats of magic Gellert would never have been able to dream of. He told of how Gellert also had the ability to wield magic; it had even been why the muggles had tried to execute him.

None of that had been the most painful part. The part which had torn at him was the knowledge that it had been his mother who had sold the secret to the church. She had been willing to watch him die just because he could do things she would never be capable of doing. The thought had made him sick. Bile used to rise in his throat at the very memory, conjoining sickeningly with the stabs of pain he had often felt in his chest, as if his heart was being pierced by a hundred sharpened daggers.

That pain had lessened over time and now, the memory of his mother meant almost nothing to him. She was just one of many muggles who had tried to wrong him because of their jealousy and their spite. He had been no different than Wylla Nurmen and hundreds or thousands of other unnamed victims. This was the only fact that still bothered him.

All of his personal demons had been long since executed, but the idea of the muggles treating wizards like vile criminals... it was one of the only things that made him angry every time he thought of it. It was like his stomach acid heated up and morphed into scalding lava at the very thought. The flush of heat and anger even rose up his body and tinged his face with its mark.

He had promised himself then that he would never trust a muggle again. Not after they had betrayed him and so many others so utterly. He hated all of them and had not so much as spoken to one since that day out of anything other than obligation. He and his father lived on the outskirts of a small German settlement nestled in the centre of vast flatlands carpeted in a thick expanse of trees. It was a muggle settlement. It was unfortunate, but his father said that Germany just didn't have the type of wizarding population needed to support entirely wizarding settlements. Gellert wished that was not the case; he wished for it above most other things.

He had spoken to several wizards over the years who were not his father. There were a few of them who lived not too far away from them and there had been the men who had come the day after his father had rescued him. They had been representatives of the German Ministry of Magic coming to inform his father that he had violated the International Statute of Secrecy. Gellert had been as worried for his father as he had been for himself whilst standing atop the pyre, but the following trial had passed with little drama. It had been unanimously agreed that Johan's use of magic was in defence of himself and his son and it had been deemed an exceptional circumstance. Gellert certainly thought that was one way of summarizing a horde of muggles trying to burn an innocent child alive.

The two of them had settled down after the trial. His father did random jobs here and there to financially support both of them. Gellert suspected that magic had done most of it, or that he used magic to supplement what it was they had at their disposal. The home they lived in was small, but comfortable and well-furnished. There was a fireplace in each of their bedrooms and one in the living room, though the walls were a touch drafty and the house could grow cold when assaulted by the chill of winter.

It had been the best four years of Gellert's life. He had wanted to learn everything he could about magic. His father was not a rich man who owned many books, nor was he a brilliant sorcerer who could tutor him in all branches of the overarching art of magic itself. Johan was patient and committed though, and those things counted for something. Gellert had been to see Mr. Gregorovich and get his wand at the age of eight. He hadn't been able to perform many spells, but just being able to feel the wand and practice moving it had been a big help.

He was now ten and his father seemed to think that when he entered Durmstrang later this year, he would have a leg up on the rest of the children. All the wizards Gellert knew were adults, so he couldn't say, but he knew he was more intelligent than a boy his age had any right to be. He was curious, observant, and he had a strange knack for remembering things. It had always come easily to him, as had grasping new concepts and just casting magic in general. Hyper-fixating on his interests hadn't hurt him, either. He was just excited to go off to Durmstrang, one way or the other.

"Do I have to sleep?" Gellert asked. "I'm not tired --- I still feel full of energy."

"You just spent two hours running around in the freezing cold. Of course you're full of energy. All the more reason to stay in bed and let yourself calm down. With the heat of this place, it shouldn't take long."

Gellert glanced around restlessly. "But I don't want to sleep."

Johan cast his own eyes about the room as though looking for the thing that would win him this argument. "What if I read you a story?"

Gellert scrunched up his face. "I've read all the books in this room. There's nothing in here that would be new to me."

"I'm not talking about a book in this room." Gellert felt interest fill him despite himself. He found himself sitting up and leaning towards his father. "There are some books I don't let you touch," he said with a smile.

"I thought you said you didn't have many books before we moved here?"

"Only a few. You've never touched any of them."

"Are they dangerous?" Gellert had heard of dangerous magics. Curses and dark spells that most people feared to mention. It quickened his pulse just thinking about it; it made him feel much like he had in the heat of the snowball fight he'd just had with his father.

"Not dangerous, no," said Johan. "They're just old, expensive, or precious."

Gellert frowned. "What's the difference between expensive and precious? Aren't they just synonyms?"

"Sometimes," his father admitted. "If something is expensive, that just means that somebody will pay you lots of money for it. If something is precious... that can mean all sorts of things. The book I'm talking about now is precious to me. It's one of the first I remember reading and I've kept it ever since."

"And you were worried I would damage it?"

"Worried about the possibility, yes." That was a thing Gellert liked about his father. He never lied to him; though maybe that was because Gellert picked up on things that most children his age would have no hope of picking up on.

"And that's also why you'll read it to me but you won't let me read it on my own?"

"Correct again."

Gellert's interest was piqued. "What is this book?"

"A book of stories. Would you like to hear one of them?" Gellert nodded; he was hardly one to turn down such things. "If I read you one of the stories, you have to promise me you'll sleep."

Gellert made a face but waved his hand. "Yes, yes, I'll sleep."

His father left the room, leaving Gellert alone with the crackling sound of the fire and the soft patches of shadow it cast around the room. The way they moved as the fire flickered almost made them look alive from where Gellert was lying on the bed, though he wasn't alone with them for long.

His father was carrying a small, leather-bound book when he returned. It looked entirely unremarkable but for its title. Gellert squinted at its cover, but he couldn't read it. It was written in runes. His father had started to teach him some basic runes several months ago, but it was slow going. Johan had never been strong in the subject and books on such magics were expensive. His father did seem to know enough to read this book though, so that was at least something.

"What's it called?" asked Gellert.

"The Tales of Beedle the Bard."

"The... what?"

His father smiled. "It's a collection of old stories. It won't teach you magic, but there are things to learn from it."

Gellert's patience was waning --- it had never been something he had been good at maintaining. "So, you're going to read one of them?"

"I am." His father paged through the ancient-looking book. Gellert could see the delicate care with which his father handled the tome and only became more interested. "What about a story about three exceptionally powerful wizards and Death?"

"And... Death?"

"Death as in the being, not the thing." Gellert could tell Johan was trying to resist smirking. "Well, there's a good deal of the thing, too." The man looked back down to the pages. "Or I can find a different one if you'd like?"

"No," said Gellert, "I want that one." He wanted to be a powerful wizard in his own right, and the idea of Death sounded interesting enough. His father had effectively managed to capture his attention.

Johan paged back to the story and cleared his throat. Gellert looked down at the page as he did. He knew almost none of the runes, but there was one symbol that caught his eye. It was no Rune he knew of and it didn't resemble what he thought a rune ought to look like. It was a roughly sketched triangular symbol with some sort of circle and line enclosed within it. He tried to look closer, but there wasn't much to see. Yet somehow, Gellert felt drawn to it, as if there was more at play here than simple shapes.

Before he could ask about the mark, his father began to read.

Harry sat slowly up in bed. These visions did not jolt him now the way they had when he had seen Wylla Nurmen put to death. He had not experienced one for a while now, but he found himself unsurprised when he had appeared in a room he had never known. It was just a thing he had to deal with now. Something that he could not escape and something that weighed on him every bit as heavily as Aberforth's cruelty, Draco's betrayal, and the mystery of Dobby and the Chamber of Secrets.

Yet he did not despise them as he once had. The first vision had caused him to vomit more violently than ever before. It had felt like his very stomach was trying to force its way up his throat to no avail and he had hated every single second of it. He still had his own nightmares about what Grindelwald had felt whilst dreaming of being burnt alive. He was sure he would never forget the burning pain. The fact it had not been his own was of no consequence; he still often woke and had to fumble his hands over his chest just to make sure his skin wasn't running down his body like fallen droplets of water.

He found that the more of Grindelwald's memories he saw, the more conflicted he became, yet he did not hate them, nor could he find it within himself to hate the boy. Harry couldn\'t imagine that boy doing all of the things Grindelwald had done, though he was starting to understand exactly why the one-time dark lord may have done all of those things. The motivations were there and Harry found he couldn't begrudge him for the way he thought and the way he felt. He didn't know if it made him just as evil as Grindelwald, or just a child sympathizing with a man he had never known.

He leant more towards the latter, for now, as he found himself almost hoping to see more of these visions. They were an escape from his own problems, even if they did burden him in an entirely different way. They were a way for him to see a world he would never see and live a life he would never live. They taught him history --- of muggles and of magic --- and they interested him more than any of his classes. Only his lessons with Cassie on duelling and with Dumbledore on Occlumency rivalled the visions on the front of intrigue.

It scared Harry. He was terrified that these thoughts came to him. It horrified him every time he went to sleep at night and he wished, even in the back of his mind, to see another excerpt of Grindelwald's life. Cold fingers seemed to run up his spine every time the desire prodded seductively at the corners of his mind, making him shiver more effectively than any Scottish winter could ever dream of doing.

It was all too much, yet he wanted more. He should not want anything more on his plate and he worried he might soon crack under the pressure of it all. Yet still, he craved more information and more experiences. He wondered then --- as he laid in his hospital bed and tried to get back to sleep; doing his best to ignore the way his very bone seemed to have broken apart into a hundred jagged rocks all seeking to pierce his skin at every opportunity --- whether or not Grindelwald had meant for this all to happen and whether or not breaking Harry was exactly what the former dark lord wanted to accomplish.

***Later that day...***

Having the bones in one's arm regrown via Skelegro was hell. That was the only thing Harry could definitively say he had learned from his most recent stay in the hospital wing. There were many pieces he had been presented with pertaining to the Chamber of Secrets, but he felt as though that puzzle was far too complicated to even consider solving. Dobby had seemed to be worried for him, for some strange reason, but until those worries found any grounding in reality, Harry was staying well away from the entire thing. Everything had been going so well during his first year until he had tried to get involved in the year's mystery. That had led to the death of his fellow student as well as a hospital stay of his own. He had no interest in repeating the incident this year, and he had more than enough on his plate without dealing with something as dangerous and complicated as Salazar Slytherin's fabled chamber.

He kept glancing over his shoulder as he left the hospital wing and edged his way towards the dungeons. He wasn't sure the end of the Quidditch match had ended the heated encounters between Gryffindors and Slytherins. Perhaps it had, but it was a chance he wasn't going to take. Not after seeing what the likes of the Weasley twins had done to some of the more vocal upper-year Slytherins. Not that he was complaining. A few of them had been among the number who had given him hell earlier in the school year, but he doubted the red-headed demons would know that Harry didn't get along with them. He didn't suspect the twins, or most other Gryffindors, discriminated. If they saw green robes, that was likely all the proof of an enemy they needed.

He neared the marble staircase before he heard footsteps. His ears pricked up. He had been exploring the castle as of late to find any other passages that could be accessed via Parseltongue. He had found one in an alcove under the staircase he was now approaching that led him quite close to the Slytherin common room. He could perhaps slip into the passage before whoever was coming drew too near, just in case it was an unfriendly lion. If he misjudged the timing and they saw him though... it was a risk he could not take.

His fingers twitched and he reached for his wand as he turned, but he had no need for it. "Thank Merlin I found you."

Diana looked slightly more disheveled than usual. That was still relatively close to immaculate, but it was less so than Harry was accustomed to. Her chest rose and fell rhythmically as she breathed a touch faster than was necessary and several locks of her platinum-blonde hair were out of place.

"Why were you looking for me?" Harry asked, eyeing the older girl up and down.

"Not here," she said, glancing around the hall. "Come on, we can talk outside."

Autumn was aging in Scotland. As its time to dwell drew shorter, so did the days. The season seemed to wane as the temperature fell, and with it went the last vestiges of what had been a smouldering hot summer. The leaves were still strewn across the grounds like splatters of vibrant paint upon a lush green canvas, but that canvas was dotted with white now. It had yet to snow properly, but frost coated what appeared to be each and every blade of grass in Harry's field of vision. He shivered against the frigid air, though there appeared to be no wind today. He had not been dressed for such weather.

"You couldn't have picked a warmer time to drag me outside? Or at least let me grab my cloak?"

Diana's lips twitched as she led him off towards the lake. "You're a wizard, are you not? If Draco knows how to cast a Warming Charm, I'm sure you do too."

His face suddenly felt a touch less cold as colour rose to his cheeks, but he withdrew his wand nonetheless and cast the aforementioned charm. Casting it felt like the first few seconds after one sat in a bath of perfectly warm water. The warmth, unfortunately, fled as fast as that of water once one took to their feet and stepped out of a tub, so it needed to be applied more often than Harry would like. He had heard some of the older students talk about tying the spell into their clothes, but he knew such magic was currently leagues beyond him.

Harry watched Draco's sister carefully. Diana had always moved with a sort of grace that couldn't be taught, but she seemed to move more stiffly today. Where normally she flowed from one movement to the next, now every shift of her body seemed rigid, forced, and tentative, as though she was unsure what might come next.

"You wanted to talk to me?"

"I wanted to warn you, but I guess talking is one word for it."

Harry's heart quickened its beat. He actually fought down a sigh; what the hell had happened now? "Warn me? About what?"

"A student was found petrified last night."

Harry considered telling her that he knew about Colin Creevey, but he thought better of it. He would have to come up with a slightly altered story convincing enough to fool the extremely perceptive Malfoy heiress, else he would need to explain to her all the other things he thought best kept to himself. He could tell her about Dobby... he had deduced whilst lying awake the night before that it had likely been the elf who had cursed the bludger if it wasn't one of the Weasley twins, but he wasn't sure how he wanted to handle that quite yet. He wanted to make sure it wasn't one of the twins, first, for one thing, and then he would decide what to do.

"It was a student this time?"

"A Gryffindor first year." She was watching him very closely, he realized. Her grey eyes seemed locked onto his green and there was an intensity there Harry had never seen before. "Colin Creevey --- he was the mousy-haired muggleborn boy who was trying to take photos of you after the game."

She waited for something, but Harry didn't know what. He frowned as the gears began turning inside his mind. What in Merlin's name was she waiting for? The way she watched him carefully... nervously...

Oh... no, surely not.

"You can't mean... nobody thinks---"

"That you did it?" Diana finished. "Nobody with a brain, no. The problem is, most people here don't seem to have one." Harry opened his mouth to speak, but Diana raised a hand to forestall him. "Most people don't think you're the Heir of Slytherin, to be clear. I don't really think anyone actually believes it, but a bunch of the Gryffindors have practically been shouting it from the rooftops."

"Why?" Harry struggled to keep his voice steady, but even he could hear the way it wavered with a note of anger he failed to suppress. "How could anyone think it's---"

"I don't think that most of them actually think it's you---"

"Okay, then pretending to, or whatever. Why? I haven't done anything to any of them---"

"You beat them at Quidditch."

He spluttered. "But that's... that's..."

"Ridiculous?" Diana asked. "Childish? Petty? Yes, it's all of those, but I don't think it's the only reason. Turnabout is fair play. Every Slytherin worth their green tie has been prancing about the school calling Weasley the Heir for the last week. I don't think *anyone* actually believes he's the Heir, but we still all went around saying it. I think it's the same thing here."

"Some people really do believe Weasley is the Heir, though. I heard some of the first years talking about it the other night. A couple of Hufflepuffs were doing a horrible job of whispering about it in the library, too."

Diana frowned. "I wonder how thick a human can get sometimes. Then I remember that Hufflepuffs exist."

Harry tried to suppress a snort, but he was only partially successful and the endeavour ended with him hiding a half variant behind his hand. "Didn't you tell Draco not to talk down to the badgers back in Madam Malkin's?"

"Oh, come on, Harry, you're smarter than that. I was telling Draco not to come off like an arrogant toerag the first time he met you; I just didn't say it in those words."

A tense silence stretched between them. The cold air seemed to rush down Harry's throat all at once and solidify into a frozen block of ice in the back of his throat. He found that words would not rise to his mouth or form on his tongue. The mention of Draco had imposed a gag seemingly formed from the manifestation of awkwardness itself.

"Anyway," said Diana, "the point is that the Gryffindors are trying to tell everyone that you're the Heir of Slytherin. None of us are going to stand for it. I've heard the chasers scheming all day; I think they're trying to decide the best way to send Wood, or Weasley, or both to the infirmary. If people really are thick enough to believe that Weasley is the Heir though, they might actually start listening to the idiots in red."

Harry reeled with the injustice of it all. He found there was no need to cast the Warming Charm now. His blood felt as though it was steaming beneath his skin now. Cold seemed to dissipate as soon as it touched him; he was surprised he wasn't surrounded by thick clouds of dense, misty steam.

"So, I'm going to have to deal with every Gryffindor and any gullible idiot without a brain coming for my head? Is that what you're saying?"

"That's the right of it, I think, yes."

Harry ran a hand through his hair. He thought about bringing up Draco and the upper years. Whether the latter would take this chance to come after Harry again, and whether the former would perhaps use this as a bridge to cross and start rebuilding their friendship. He knew that thought was wishful even as it formed, but he could not help hoping.

"Is there anything else?"

"Nothing that you can't figure out on your own. The rivalry has gotten even worse since the match. The Weasley twins set up some sort of rune cluster trap outside the Slytherin common room last night. A group of fifth years leaving to go and get more food from the kitchens for the party ended up in the infirmary with horrible burns. The runes on the floor lit their robes on fire as soon as they stepped on the floor outside the common room."

That... was an escalation. All the cases of students in the infirmary so far had been relatively minor. A couple of concussions had been the worst of it, but this... this was taking the conflict to an entirely new level.

"So, the Gryffindors want to frame me for a crime and probably make my life a living hell. Some people might actually be stupid enough to believe them and try and curse me in the back, and the Weasley twins might want to actually kill me just because I'm wearing green?"

Diana shrugged. "I'm not sure if they actually wanted to kill or if they're just careless idiots, but it all works out to the same point, I suppose."

"Right," Harry said bitterly, making a conscious effort not to scowl. "Is there any good news?"

Diana smiled. "That the bad news is over and we can just spend some time out here before Scotland decides that going out onto the grounds is an offence punishable by frostbite?"

Harry could not help but laugh. Draco might be a childish prat, but he still liked Diana.

***That night, in the hidden room...***

Ron was breathing heavily by the time Cedric's voice rang through the hidden room and called for a stop to their spell casting. They had focused on casting jinxes and hexes whilst moving tonight. It had actually been Susan's idea. Her aunt was the Head of the DMLE and had been an auror for a brief time. She had seen many aurors through training so Susan had written her for basic ideas to start improving as a duellist. This had been one of the drills she had suggested.

Ron thought the woman either needed to be given an Order of Merlin or be beaten over the head with a broomstick. He had noticed marginal improvements already, but his legs felt like lead and his lungs as if they were full of smoke. His chest heaved with the effort of breathing and he felt as if he would throw up at any moment.

He had spent several months working on spells and all the rest, but he had never realized how bloody tiring any of this could be. Perhaps he should have been running instead of reading... or maybe that was just the part of his brain that wanted to be on a broomstick every time he opened a book. It was persistent, but pretty easy to shut up. Calling forth the image of Neville's grave usually did the trick quite effectively.

"Good practice, everyone," said Cedric, turning to the auburn-haired Bones heiress. "Thanks again for the help, Susan. Write your aunt and tell her the same, if you don't mind." Susan smiled and nodded. Cedric raised his wand and caused the time to display in front of him. "A few minutes before we need to worry about curfew," he said, turning to Ron. "How are you feeling after yesterday's game?"

Ron scowled. "Like a bumbling troll," he spat. "Potter had a bludger after him the whole bloody game and the git still beat me to the snitch."

"You looked like you were going to beat him to it," said Susan, "what happened?"

Ron's face flushed as he turned away. He didn't want to look at them as he recalled the emotions rushing through him as the bastards in green and silver chanted about him from the stands. When the song had begun, he had first thought it was coming from the Gryffindor section, but as the lyrics grew more and more incendiary, he quickly realized that was not the case. The wankers even had the nerve to chant about him being the Heir of Slytherin! Sure, they might not have said it in those words, but Ron knew he was no genius and even he had figured that part out.

"I... I fumbled it," he said after a moment. He turned back to them all, looking to the floor. His cheeks were still warm, but his skin no longer felt like it would melt off of his face from the heat of his blush. "I... it was that stupid song! I got distracted and... and..."

Cedric rested a hand on his shoulder. "It's just one match," he said kindly. "You almost had him, too. You beat seekers much older than you last year." He grinned. "I would say you could win the Quidditch Cup if Slytherin loses, but you would have to beat me to the snitch."

Ron shoved him back, hard, and the older boy laughed. Even the youngest male Weasley was grinning now. "Prat," he said, hiding his own laughter behind his hand as it rose up within him.

"What do you think about what they're saying about him?" asked Hannah. She sounded nervous, but she often did. She was definitely the shyest of the group.

"It's more likely than Ron," said Hermione with some disdain.

"It's rubbish," said Cedric. "The rest of your house just want to get back at Slytherin for the match."

"Do they, though?" asked Susan. "That boy goes and tries to take photos of Potter while he's embarrassed and injured, and then he just shows up petrified that night?"

"He is also a Slytherin," Hannah muttered darkly.

"That doesn't mean he's some kind of child dark lord," argued Cedric. "Just because You-Know-Who was a Slytherin doesn't mean they're all bad."

"Haven't met many good ones," said Ron. He had nothing against Slytherin as a general rule, but most of them had treated him like rubbish ever since the first day he had arrived at the castle.

"Sirius Black was a Gryffindor." Ron grimaced at Cedric's words, but nodded. The boy had a point there that could not be disputed. "There's no way Potter's the Heir. No second year could do any of what's happened."

"They thought nobody could survive the curse You-Know-Who hit him with either," Hermione reminded them all. "Some people say that Potter must have had some sort of power that even *he* didn't have."

"Don't be ridiculous," said Cedric, "he was a baby."

"A baby who destroyed the most powerful dark sorcerer of all time."

Cedric sighed. "Look, believe what you want, but don't go spreading this nonsense about Potter around. If you believe it, then fine, but don't go spreading it."

"I'm not saying I believe it," Hermione said quickly, "just that it seems silly to just pretend it isn't possible."

"Do what you like," said Cedric. "I'm confident that it isn't Potter. If I'm wrong, I'll eat my words."

***The Library***

***8:43 PM***

Harry's neck ached as he straightened up in his chair. He had been leaning over a book on intermediate Transfiguration for hours and every muscle from his shoulders up seemed to have tied themselves in a painfully throbbing knot. Every time Harry moved his neck, it felt as though his muscles collided and entangled with one another, ripping and tearing as they went.

He enjoyed Daphne, Tracey, Blaise, and the others, but the group was rarely all together in one place. They would more often break off into smaller groups and do their own individual things. Harry went to the library any time this happened. Those times had been more frequent this month and he had gone off on his own more than ever before --- whether it be to explore the library, practice spells in abandoned classrooms, or to explore the castle, Harry seemed to be off doing his own thing more often than not these days.

It was probably because there were just so many things plaguing his thoughts. The whole moral dilemma involving Grindelwald, his detentions with Aberforth, and the fact that a good third of the school was set so vehemently against him. He could scarcely walk down a corridor without having some form of magic hurled at his back.

Some of the older students were even bold enough to do it to his face, but none of the younger ones. Not after he had sent a large third-year boy to the hospital wing and a second-year scampering when he had tried to attack him after the fact. That had earned him some respect, but the respect had manifested as wariness, not admiration. It had strengthened the idiots' case against him, if anything, and it just meant that people planned their strikes more carefully now.

He was sick and tired of all of it and it was weighing on him too heavily. He felt like fresh iron twisted to its breaking point. He was stubborn and unwavering, but eventually, he would break. If he wanted to avoid that, he was going to have to do something, but he would not get involved this year... not directly.

He had put a great deal of thought into the matter of the Chamber of Secrets over the past number of weeks. If he wanted to go back to not living a hellacious existence at Hogwarts, he was going to have to somehow prove he was innocent. He was also going to have to do that without putting himself in the line of fire this time, and the easiest way to start was by figuring out what the hell was going on.

He planned to ask Dumbledore about the Chamber of Secrets the next time they practiced Occlumency. He doubted the Headmaster would be all that forthcoming, but he had always encouraged Harry's questions and they had now reached the state of practice at which Dumbledore was launching actual probes into his mind. They were weak and blunt, easy to detect and easy to deflect, but it was a start. If he seemed particularly fatigued after one of these lessons and Dumbledore was in a good enough mood... well, the old man was known for his generosity. It wasn't out of the question that he might allow his tongue to loosen for a brief bit of time.

But that was far from a sure bet and Harry needed to know what was going on. If not Dumbledore, he needed someone else who knew anything. McGonagall had sounded every bit as confused as Harry when she'd spoken with the Headmaster in the hospital wing that night, and Harry would never have gone to her anyway. The same went for the rest of the staff, which left him with only one option.

Dobby had known something. Perhaps at Malfoy Manor, Harry might have thought the elf was bluffing, but not now. The bludger had been examined and the staff had concluded that the ball had not been tampered with by any means that they knew of. The Weasley twins were good, but not that good. Daphne had told him once when discussing house elves that their magic worked differently than that of witches and wizards. It would explain why none of the professors had been able to unearth anything and it would explain why Dobby had been watching him that night in the hospital wing.

He could have told Diana, but something held him back. There would just be a lot to explain and it felt... outside of their current dynamic. He would have told Draco at the school year's start, but that was now firmly out of the question. Lord Malfoy had always encouraged Harry to write, but he was the member of the family Harry thought most likely to have been manipulating him the whole time. Daphne's words had struck home with him and there really were a startling number of coincidences. Most of them were absolutely well within Lucius Malfoy's capabilities to engineer.

But he had not been the only member of the Malfoy family to encourage Harry to write.

He rolled his head to work out the cramp in his neck as he reached down and withdrew a sheet of parchment from his bag. A quill followed and he pressed its tip to the parchment.

*Lady Malfoy...*

***August 25, 1893***

***Durmstrang Institute ***

***8:37 PM***

Gellert's feet slammed into the ground with more force than he had been expecting. Summer was still in full bloom back in his native homeland of Germany. The grass was still a lush green and the ground was softened by the sun's warm glow. 

None of that was true here.

There was no give to the Earth that his feet slammed into. He might as well have landed on solid concrete for how tightly packed the ground was beneath him. 

That was the first thing he noticed. The next was the biting cold. September had not yet spread its wings and flown into prominence, yet the air was as frigid as one would expect in a German winter. The wind seemed dormant, but it was a small mercy. Even bundled up in so much fur that Gellert thought his legs would buckle from the weight, he shivered.

It was dark, too. Much darker than it would have been in Germany. It appeared to be the middle of the night and he thought he would have been lost had it not been for the thin layer of shining white snow that coated the ground all around him and the splendid sight laid out before him.

He had landed a ways up what appeared to be one of many mountains that formed a perfect ring around a vast expanse of frozen land. The mountain he found himself on had a path carved roughly into its side. The path led down the mountain and continued all the way across the grounds, leading for some time until it reached the building Gellert knew he was here for.

It was a great castle, though not in the way many castles of myths were great. It was squat compared to most of them and it was not made of any bright and shiny stones. It was comprised completely of hard grey rock and had only four floors, though the ceilings of each did not seem high. There was not a great deal to say of the structure. It was solid and seemed as though it had stood forever and would endure forevermore. It looked ready to withstand a siege at any moment, though it was perhaps unfit to hold great and splendid banquets for men and women of the highest esteem.

The only reason Gellert could make it out in such detail at all was because of the vantage point he had thanks to the mountain, for the castle itself was surrounded by a high wall of the same solid grey stone that it was crafted from. The wall was about half as high as the castle and there appeared only to be one gated entrance through the impenetrable wall of stone. 

Yet the defences did not end there. He could hear rushing water from all around him. It seemed to roar like a lion and clap against the shore like a hundred thunderbolts in the relative silence of the night. It was everywhere; he could see four lakes spread across the grounds from here alone and there was a great moat that enclosed both the castle and its wall. There were a number of bridges across that were all lowered, as far as Gellert could see, but he doubted that was often the case.

The castle itself might not have been the most dazzling sight in the world, but the path that led to it was positively enchanting. 

The entire path was lined by knights made completely from ice on both sides. They stood nearly ten-feet tall and held the largest torches that Gellert had ever seen. Yet the mechanisms in their hands did not flicker with the orange glow of fire. They shone with a pale magical light that was almost as bright as the snow. The snow and light seemed to try and outshine one another, painting the long, straight path in a pale halo of magical light that took Gellert's breath away. The lakes on either side of the path shone ghostly in their light. If not for their restless churning, Gellert suspected the light would have rendered them every bit as transparent as the shining surface of Lake Königssee all the times he had peered down from atop the mountain and looked wondrously into its depths.

There were sounds all around him as his fellow classmates landed. Their feet hit the ground every bit as hard as his and they all wore the same uniform that he himself was adorned in. They all looked at one another but did not say so much as a word as more and more of them appeared.

When the constant bluish blurs of portkeys finally ceased, the lot of them were left huddled together at the mouth of the path and shivering against the biting cold. Gellert wondered why none of them moved towards the castle, but he found he did not have the impulse to do it. He was frozen by the cold and the air of such a place. Magic seemed to hum all around him and the way the light shone made the entire thing feel completely and totally surreal.

A noise from below drew their collective attention and they all turned. The two nearest knights had moved forward as if they were alive. They held their magical torches aloft in one hand and hefted long, great swords in the other. It was with these that they beckoned all of the first years forward. No one moved for a moment until Gellert took a deep breath and became the first to step forward. Once he moved, the others followed all at once and the icy figures turned. They stood side by side and walked in perfect unison, marching the new crop of students like a procession of well-trained soldiers down towards the castle nestled in the centre of this frozen expanse of land.

The walk was long and cold. They had to walk past many of the lakes along their trek. It had seemed windless on their perch high on one of the mountains, but the air seemed to slash across their faces like whips of ice as they passed by the water. It left Gellert's cheeks stinging and his nose running, but he did not react. His father had told him to stay strong and vigilant.

The descent to the castle felt as though it took forever, but they had eventually crossed the moat and passed through the gate. There were two more knights of ice standing guard at the castle's front entrance, but they swiftly moved aside to allow the first years and their enchanted escorts to pass. 

Torch brackets hung along the walls of a long and narrow corridor that greeted the first years as soon as they stepped into the castle. The brackets shone with the same magical light held by their escorts. Gellert thought the corridor would be nearly pitch-black if not for the light, but he wasn't sure he wouldn't have preferred that. It cast strange, leaping shadows about the walls. They seemed to lurk just out of sight before lunging forth. Several times during the walk down the hall, Gellert had taken them for sudden movement out of the corner of his eye.

Finally, the corridor ended. There was another to the left and right, but before them was a massive room that they were led into by their two guards of honour. 

This room was lit more scarcely than the corridor outside, though perhaps it only seemed that way because of its size. There were no windows, but it was a very long room. At its front was a table of rich, dark wood, at which sat men who must have been the professors. Less comfortable tables spread across the rest of the hall. They were longer than the professors' and lined up one behind the other like rows of desks in a classroom. There were seven of them in total and he knew at once that each of them were for a separate year. Gellert and the rest of the first years were led to the back of the hall. Only then did their guards of ice march to the front of the professors' table, bow in perfect unison to an old, hard-looking man who sat in a black, throne-like chair, and leave the hall. There were a number of other knights of ice all throughout the room; it seemed that the service of these two was no longer required.

Gellert's eyes seemed to devour the room as the man who sat the black throne took to his feet. Gellert hardly noticed. His eyes darted from one knight of ice, to a magical sphere of light, and back again. He watched the older students, too. Some of them watched the first years and others still conversed in low voices, but these students were scarce. Most of them sat with straight backs and polite expressions, their complete and undivided attention fixated upon the tall, old man who had taken to his feet.

Gellert cared naught for old men. Gellert cared for the castle and the magic and all he would learn. Gellert cared for all of the dreams he would fulfill. Gellert cared for one, undeniable truth. He was finally at the place he had belonged for all of his years.

***The Headmaster's Office***

***9:56 PM***

Harry resisted the urge to groan as he sat back in his chair. His head felt as though someone had stabbed him behind the eyes with something sharp and scalding. He often felt like this nowadays after he completed a lesson in Occlumency with the Headmaster. They had progressed to the point at which Dumbledore was actively deploying Legilimency probes against him. He was becoming more and more proficient at fending off his attacks. Harry knew they were deliberately weak and blunt, but it was a start.

"You are doing well," Dumbledore said as though still reading his thoughts. "Your progression is exponential. Your leaps grow further and your bounds higher the longer these lessons progress. It is really quite astonishing."

"Thank you, sir." Harry couldn't help but feel warm at the sentiment. He wasn't usually one to allow compliments like this to touch him. Compliments about him as a person were one thing --- those had been non-existent whilst on Privet Drive and were still nearly as alien to him as Diagon Alley had been that first day with Hagrid. He had been praised enough in the last year by professors to take academic compliments for what they were. When they came from the greatest wizard alive, however, and referred to something he was genuinely passionate about... "Thank you again for the help."

"I owed you that much," said Dumbledore. "I could hardly refuse you after what you went through last June."

Harry allowed a deep frown to spread across his face. He would need to tread carefully through this bit of the conversation. "I was hoping that would be the last thing like that to happen at Hogwarts."

The light behind Dumbledore's eyes seemed to dim by a margin. "As did I, Harry, as did I." He cast his eyes about the room. "It is interesting the patterns that befall this school."

"Patterns, sir?"

"Yes, indeed." The man's fingers tapped rhythmically upon the surface of his desk as his lips pulled tightly together. It appeared to Harry as though he was pondering something very deeply. "Hogwarts has been a safe haven for many years. Its reputation as being one of the safest places in Britain is well-founded. Yet you and I both know all that transpired last year and we are just as painfully aware of what is currently taking place within our very walls."

"Is there a reason, sir? You said that Hogwarts was safe for a long time. Is there a reason that this is the second year in a row that it isn't? One could have just been a coincidence, but two in a row seems a bit off for a place that's supposed to be so safe."

"It does, yes. I have my suspicions, but I am afraid I cannot present any true evidence for any of them beyond the patterns I spoke of earlier."

"Can you explain those, sir?"

"I can, though some would argue doing so would be unwise." His fingers tapped upon the desk once more. "The last time Hogwarts experienced anything like the last two years was half a century ago. There was a year much like this, but it was not the only thing of note. There were... troubling things taking place for a number of years. Troubling things that all seemed to happen around a young, brilliant boy."

Harry's frown deepened. "I'm not seeing the pattern, sir?"

"Aren't you?" Dumbledore smiled thinly. "You are the pattern, Harry." 

Harry's mouth went dry. "Me?"

"You are the closest thing Hogwarts has seen to this boy in all of those years. Both halfbloods, both Slytherins, why, even both orphans. There are other things, too. This boy displayed an aptitude for magic the likes of which I had not seen for many years. You have a similar gift. A natural ease with which you wield the force and bend it to your will. It is a rare talent, but one that cannot bloom truly without the proper mind to give it fuel."

"Professor Flitwick said something like that last year," Harry remembered. "We talked about it in the library. He said I was by far the most talented student in the year but that I needed to focus more on magical theory."

"I do remember Filius mentioning a conversation of the like. Tell me, Harry, did you focus more on the more subtle facets of magic?"

"Yes, sir --- I've been doing all I can to get ahead."

"Very good. Do feel free to come to me with any questions if you find yourself stuck. I understand if you don't wish to trouble your professors with more advanced material --- though any of them would be glad to assist you. I do so love magic, just as I really do miss teaching. Alas, my schedule is quite full these days and time makes fools of even the greatest of men."

Harry found that his mouth felt dry again. He wanted something from this conversation, but that had not been it. It had not been what he had expected, but it was a resource he would most certainly be leaning on in the future. He would be foolish not to --- what kind of idiot would turn down help from the most brilliant magician alive?

"Thank you, sir. I... appreciate it. I'll think of some things you might be able to help with." 

"Splendid," said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling once more, "now, where were we?"

"You were talking about me and the boy from fifty years ago."

"Ah, yes. There was much that happened at Hogwarts during his time here, yet the castle grew quite quiet once he left." His lips twitched. "Well, it was far from quiet whilst your father and his marauding group of friends and admirers dwelled here, but it was never truly dangerous in the way it is now. The castle remained perfectly safe until your first year, and I am afraid it has not grown safer since."

"So... you're saying that when students with higher potential come to Hogwarts, it gets more dangerous?"

"Something like that, yes. Great men attract greater things. People fair and foul flock to them like moths to an open flame. It can lead to prosperity, but it can also lead to danger. The fact that you are the defeater of Voldemort and the most famous student to ever walk the halls only makes you even more sought after."

Harry remembered the way Dobby had spoken of the plot at Hogwarts and he remembered the way the elf had specifically wanted him to stay far away from the great castle. Was it possible that something about the Chamber of Secrets being opened had something to do with him?

"Sir... is me being here causing these things to happen?"

"Perhaps, though it is through no fault of your own if that is the case. You certainly had nothing to do with the petrification of poor Master Creevey."

Well, at least Dumbledore wasn't blinded by the Gryffindors' baseless accusations. That much was obvious, but part of him had still been holding tension throughout the entire meeting. That small part of him that wondered whether Dumbledore thought him the Heir of Slytherin.

"Sir... have you or any of the other teachers found anything about the Chamber of Secrets?"

"I am afraid not," said Dumbledore. The lines etched upon his aged face suddenly seemed deeper and more pronounced. "I am hopeful that will change, but not entirely optimistic."

"Are you worried you and the professors might not be able to stop whatever's happening?"

Dumbledore sighed. "I will not be the first Headmaster who has looked for Salazar's fabled chamber, nor will I be the last. It will not even be the first time I go looking for such a place. Let us hope that I am more successful than I was all those years ago."

"Is this the first time the Chamber of Secrets has been opened?"

Dumbledore watched him very carefully. "It is not," he said at last. "I did say that dangerous things happened at Hogwarts all those years ago, did I not?" 

Harry's eyes widened. "One of those things was the chamber being opened?"

"Indeed." Dumbledore looked up towards the clock upon the wall. "Goodness me, the time grows late and curfew draws near. You'd best be off to bed, Harry. I would not wish for you to be late on my account."

Harry made for the door, recognizing his dismissal, his thoughts whirling. He had gotten more than he had bargained for in this meeting. 

***November 21, 1992***

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***10:34 PM***

Harry's body ached with every step he took. He was grateful for Cassie walking alongside him as they neared the smooth stone steps that led down into the Hogwarts dungeons. He thought it unlikely he would topple down them, but he would not completely discount the possibility. Tonight had been one of their more taxing practices. There had been a great deal of mock duelling. Harry was still a very long way off from even competing with Cassie, but he was improving greatly. The older Slytherin was confident she was the best duelist in the school, so she wasn't exactly who Harry should be comparing himself against. Not to say that he wasn't doing that, but it did make the bruises sting less and the aches of his muscles felt a touch more bearable. 

"Unitatis," said Cassie as they reached the common room minutes later, causing the stone wall to slide aside with its usual groan that for some reason seemed unusually ominous. 

The air in the common room was tense. Harry knew something was amiss as soon as he stepped inside. His eyes swept around the room and did not immediately recognize what exactly had created such tension.

Most students were lounging in chairs as usual. The first thing he noticed was that none of them seemed buried in their homework, or books, or other pursuits that necessitated their eyes to be cast downwards. Their heads were all raised and tilted in the same direction. Only when Harry followed the pattern did he see the commotion, though it was hard to make out exactly what was happening, for a larger cluster of students enclosed the action so tightly that seeing through their ranks was nearly impossible.

Cassie --- who was years older and much taller than Harry --- must have seen. She strode forward without a seconds' hesitation, flicking her wand back into her hand. Harry followed curiously behind her, drawing his own wand in the process. He wasn't sure whether it was the older girl's status as a prefect or reputation as a duelist that encouraged the crowd to move aside, but they did so with no complaints.

When they parted, Harry wasn't sure what he had expected to see, but what he saw was not it. Two first years had been enclosed by the circle, but one was standing and one was lying face down. His robes were torn and blood pooled around him like a dark crimson puddle as he tried to rise. The one standing over him had the same golden-blond hair as Cassie and his wand was raised. He was halfway through another slash when Cassie grabbed his arm.

The boy whirled and tried to bring his wand up to fire a spell, but he was frozen in place by his older sister's stare before an incantation could form on his tongue. 

"And what exactly have you been doing?" Cassie's voice was soft, but dangerous. It was a stark contrast to her usually outgoing and borderline bubbly persona. It took Harry aback, but her brother did not waver.

"Putting this prat in his place." He gestured towards the fallen boy who was still struggling to rise. Judging by the way his leg kept buckling, the gaping wound just below his shoulder blades wasn't the only damage he had taken in the conflict. Harry would be remiss to call it a duel; it had been much too one-sided by the look of it. 

He remembered what Lucius had said about the Yaxleys and what Lord Corbin had then affirmed. They were a family renowned for duelling. It was a sort of tradition for members of House Yaxley to spend several years post Hogwarts on the duelling circuit. They were trained in the art from an early age and Harry knew first-hand that both Corban and Cassandra were excellent instructors. It was no surprise that the youngest of them, Cadmus, was the better of the two first years, but this had not been a victory --- it had been a bloody massacre. 

"There is a time and a place." Cassie spoke in the same tone of voice she had before, but still her brother remained far from cowed. "You could have killed him, you idiot." She glanced around at the gathered crowd. Most of them were first years, though a few were in the second or third year; Harry even thought he saw a few older students gathered among them. "Why did none of you stop this?"

Every pair of eyes in the gathered crowd seemed to fall to the floor when Cassie spoke. The only exception Harry saw were two pairs of dark brown eyes belonging to girls who looked startlingly identical to one another. The Carrow twins, he remembered. He wondered not for the first time if witches and wizards were somehow more likely to have twins than muggles, but he was a touch more distracted by the way Cadmus Yaxley was glaring at him as though he had done the boy a great personal disservice. 

He met his stare unflinchingly and raised an eyebrow. Yaxley's eyes narrowed as he turned back to his sister. "I wasn't going to kill him," he spat. "I know what I'm doing. I don't need you to teach me or lecture me on how to do things." 

He wrenched his arm from his sister's grip and threw one last disdainful look at Harry before storming off. Harry watched him leave warily, his hand not far from his wand. He wasn't sure what he had done to draw the younger boy's ire, but he was not going to be attacked by him whilst unaware. It was typical that he would have to watch for yet another viper lurking in the shadows.

Cassie dispersed the crowd and ordered the other first year --- a slight boy named Martin Harper --- to be taken off to the hospital wing.

"So," Harry asked Daphne and the others when he took his seat alongside them, "what exactly did I miss?"

"Children being children," answered Daphne. "Harper said something about how Yaxley's father was overrated at the ministry. Yaxley said something about how at least his wasn't in Azkaban and things spiralled."

"Charming," said Harry. "Any idea why the younger Yaxley was looking at me like I had just tried to curse him in the back?"

"Probably because you walked in with the older one," said Daphne.

Harry frowned. "Why would that make him want to curse me?"

"Jealousy, spite, all kinds of childish things." She shrugged. "Don't ask me to explain how a normal eleven-year-old's mind works. It's kind of depressing and I try not to think about it."

Harry snorted. "Naturally." He glanced around at the rest of his friends and wondered whether Cadmus Yaxley's outburst had been the only thing of note to happen whilst he was gone. All of them were looking between him and Daphne as though they were waiting for something to happen. "Did I miss anything else interesting?" 

Daphne's lips curved up into a cruel smile as she leant forward, a gleam dancing in her sapphire eyes. "As it happens, you did..."

***November 25, 1992***

***The Great Hall ***

***8:54 AM***

*Harry,*

*Thank you for writing to me about the elf. The creature should never have been at Hogwarts. I'm sorry for all the trouble it caused you. He has been dealt with, but not before he was questioned. It was him who enchanted that wretched bludger, so you don't need to worry about anyone else having done it. *

*I'm afraid he didn't know anything about what's going on at Hogwarts. He was a mad and ill creature who hadn't been right in the head for years. There wasn't much he had to offer beyond paranoia, I'm afraid. *

*I'm glad that you wrote to me and hope you would consider continuing to do so. I've heard even less of you lately because of your argument with Draco, but it's lovely speaking with you again.*

*Write soon and enjoy the rest of your term.*

*Sincerely,*

*Narcissa*

Harry put down the letter and tried to force down his disappointment. He had been hoping that Dobby might know something about the Chamber of Secrets. Especially now that Dumbledore's cryptic history lesson had given him pause as to whether or not the whole fiasco might be somehow linked to him. He was happy the elf wouldn't be trying to kill him with any other enchanted bludgers, but he'd had other hopes for writing to Narcissa.

And the bit about writing more often...

Harry wasn't sure how to feel. Much of what the Malfoys had done screamed of manipulation. Could he trust Narcissa? He had continued to trust Diana and she had not led him astray. She had always counselled him well and he still counted her among his closest friends. She was his oldest friend now that Draco and he were no longer speaking with each other. Harry distrusted Lord Malfoy most of all. He was the one who pulled the strings in the Malfoy family. If they had manipulated him, he at least was a part of it.

But Narcissa...

He thought back to every time he had spoken with her and the memory of their first interaction floated to the forefront of his mind. It had been on Platform Nine and Three Quarters. His stomach had been filled with excitement despite the dreary and monotonous weather, for that had been the day he'd been set to travel to Hogwarts. 

She had mentioned how the two of them were family and she had encouraged him to write her about that. Harry had never taken her up on it, but why not now? It wasn't really something she could use to manipulate him and it might allow him to get to know her better.

He nodded silently to himself and leant over to reach into his bag and pull out a piece of parchment, but a horrible sound from someone near the centre of the table drew his attention.

Glass shattered and sprayed everywhere. Several students cried out as it pierced their legs and coloured the hems of their robes crimson. Others manage to scramble out of the way as Damian Travers's older brother swung a knife this way and that. People practically dove for cover as he batted more silverware aside. He used one hand to slash at the air with the knife whilst he clawed at his own face with the other. Blood was blossoming on his cheeks and running down his face. 

Harry would have thought that the boy might claw his own eyes out if he wasn't careful, but nothing about this screamed of caution. It was clear that Travers was out of his mind. He must have been bewitched, or poisoned, or influenced in some other way.

Poisoned... 

His posture straightened so fast it was as though he had been subjected to an eletric shock. He remembered suspecting Travers of sending him bubotuber pus all those weeks ago and he remembered the few people he had told. 

He doubted it was a coincidence this had happened after last night, either. Suddenly, Harry knew exactly who had poisoned the elder Travers brother.

***Four days earlier, in the Slytherin common room...***

"Oh?" asked Harry, eyeing Daphne with a mixture of interest and suspicion.

"You remember telling us that you thought Travers was the one to send you the pus?" He nodded --- it had not been long after he'd seen the boy staring at him the day the foul substance had been sent. "Well, I told you that I would be finding out who did it, and I have."

He blinked. "How?"

"Ancient Runes," she answered. "I... convinced one of his friends to draw a very specific set of runes onto a random page in one of his textbooks that he wasn't likely to look at. I carved a corresponding set and had them tied together. It lets me listen into anything he says so long as the book is nearby." Her expression turned predatory. "Today, he finally slipped."

***Back in the present...***

Harry watched as the boy writhed and clawed at his own face. Professors were rushing over now and he knew it would end at any moment, but he could not help but be transfixed by the grotesque spectacle. 

Two thoughts crashed over him as swiftly as the poison must have flowed through Travers's veins.

The first was that he *really* needed to start putting much more time and effort into Ancient Runes, and the second was far more pressing and a touch more disturbing.

He felt no desire to look away from the sight before him. On the contrary, he could feel nothing as he watched. There was no pleasure, it was true, but nor was there any empathy or regret. There was only cold indifference. Conjoined with all of the other questions Harry had been asking about himself as of late, he was unsure how to feel.

***November 28, 1992***

***The Slytherin Common Room***

***9:58 PM***

A sense of déjà vu washed over Harry as he stepped into the Slytherin common room. He had finished yet another night of practice with Cassie. He was less battered this time, as the practice had consisted mostly of honing spells and techniques. The girl was also absent from him. She had gone off on her own to find something in the library before calling it a night. She had hoped to beat curfew, but Harry doubted she was worried about being caught if she wasn't fast enough.

When he re-entered the common room after the practice, it was tense once more. He wondered whether the same sort of thing had happened for a moment, but he quickly realized that it was not the same. Similar, perhaps, but there were noticeable differences.

Nobody's eyes were cast towards an ongoing spectacle. Everyone was either looking down quietly or their heads were together as they conversed in low whispers. Harry cast his gaze about the dimly-lit room. This time, he failed to identify exactly what was causing the problem, which only made him tense all the more.

He looked for his friends but found only one of them. Blaise was seated in his usual spot in the room, but Daphne, Tracey, Millicent, and Lilian were all absent. Harry's heart quickened as he made his way towards the quietest of their group. The very air seemed so thick that his movements felt impeded as he tried to close the distance between them. Something was undoubtedly wrong, but he had no idea what it might be.

"Blaise," he asked in a low whisper when he took the seat to the boy's left, "what's happened? What's going on?"

Blaise gave him a long, hard look. "You might want to go and see our Head of House." His voice was as pensive as the smooth surface of the sea. It gave away nothing as to what might dwell beneath. A chill ran up Harry's spine. Blaise was always guarded, but never had he spoken so carefully or with such clinical coolness. 

But then, all confusion and worry over Blaise was wiped swiftly away when the boy uttered his next words.

"Tracey's been attacked and Snape is looking for you."

***Severus Snape's Office***

***10:24 PM***

Snape's office was as dark and ominous as Harry remembered. The low, ghostly light of the place contrasted with the floating jars and vials of things Harry didn't even have names for. Some of the things gleamed within whatever liquids they were drenched in, whilst others practically dripped with thick and colourful slime.

Harry was focusing on none of this. He had eyes only for the man sitting across the desk from him. Snape had started watching him the moment he had stepped across his threshold and his eyes had not left Harry since. It made the youth uneasy. He wanted to fidget, but he resisted the urge. Snape was exactly the kind of man who would take such movements for guilt or weakness. The last thing Harry wanted was to be falsely accused of something he had never done. If anyone in the castle was likely to do that, it was probably his own Head of House. The irony of that fact was not lost on him, but he took amusement in the sick truth of his situation.

"My, my, Potter, you have found yourself in quite the predicament, haven't you?"

A year ago, Harry thought he might have spouted off about how he had never done it and where he had been during the attack. He would have reeled off how much he liked Tracey and how he had no wish to see her hurt. A year ago, he might have made a blustering idiot of himself, but not now. Snape would ask for only what he wanted to hear. Giving more than that would make Harry seem desperate, so he resisted the urge to spew forth every single thought that flitted chaotically across his mind.

"Yes, sir," he answered instead.

"Why is it you were unaccounted for during the window of time the attack might have been carried out, Potter?"

"I was practicing, sir."

"Practicing what?"

"Practicing duelling, sir."

Snape's expression did not shift, but Harry could sense a change in him. "And why does the infamous defeater of the Dark Lord believe he needs to learn to duel?"

Because said Dark Lord wasn't dead? Because half of the house would love to see him made a fool of in front of the entire school? Because he had seen three corpses in the past year, not counting poor Wylla Nurmen via Grindelwald's visions? He could tell almost none of this to Snape.

Dumbledore had made him swear back in the hospital wing that the secret of Voldemort's return needed to be kept between the two of them. As for Grindelwald... that was an entirely different situation that troubled him more at this point than Britain's own Dark Lord or even the fate of Neville Longbottom. The way he felt while watching some of those memories... it scared him. The last thing he wanted was for a man like Snape to glean any of the reasons why it troubled him so much. Best if he had no notion about any of that.

"It's my housemates, Professor," he decided to answer. "Ever since my argument with Draco, the upper years have been hexing me in the hallways and the common room."

"Can anyone attest to this, Potter? Or am I to believe the son of a man who would tell his professors the world was ending if it would win him a moment of their attention?"

Harry felt a blush threaten to rise, but he tried hard to fight it down. Something about that comment had cut him and he could not explain why. He should have no connection to his father, yet the remark had hit home. He knew little of the man beyond his prowess at Quidditch, aptitude in Transfiguration and that he had fought against Voldemort. Narcissa was slowly revealing tidbits about the man over her letters, but they had begun coming only recently. Harry had no idea whether the insinuations Snape was hurling at his father were true. He hoped not, but he did not dare to speak up. Both because he feared the validity of his doubts and because of all the professors at Hogwarts, Snape was the one he wanted to anger least.

"I don't want attention, sir." Harry forced himself to look at Snape as he made his voice come out as polite as he could possibly manage. "I want the opposite. I wish they would leave me alone. They won't listen to me, so I want to learn to protect myself."

Snape watched him intently. Harry sensed that the man was looking for any reason to doubt him or trying to find an opening to cast aspersions, but evidently, he could find none.

"Very well. Can anyone vouch that you were indeed where you claimed to be tonight?"

"Cassandra Yaxley, sir. She's been helping me practice."

Harry thought he saw surprise flash in Snape's eyes, but it was gone so fast he was sure he'd imagined it. The Potions Master had always been as impassive as a wall made of solid stone.

"I will be speaking with Miss Yaxley next. We shall see if her word supports your tale." He leant forward and now his eyes seemed to be doing their best to burn a hole straight through Harry's face. "Can you think of anyone who would have liked to see Miss Davis petrified, Potter?"

He couldn't. If Travers had known that Daphne was the one who had poisoned him, then maybe. Perhaps he might have thought the Greengrass heiress too risky a target and settled for her halfblood friend. That would have made sense, but Travers had not yet left the care of Madam Pomfrey. They had considered sending the boy to St. Mungo's, but the school's matron had been confident she would be able to see that the boy returned to full health

Harry doubted Travers had orchestrated the attack from a hospital bed and he had no way of knowing that Daphne had been behind his own recent bout of trouble. Beyond that... Tracey was a halfblood, so there were doubtlessly some hostile upper years, but most of them largely ignored halfbloods as a general rule. They would sneer at them or shove them out of the way, but rarely would they scorn them openly. Harry was an exception --- not every halfblood had been the downfall of a man whom many of their parents had once sworn fealty to. Maybe if Tracey was a muggleborn then they may have had the desire, but outside of that...

He bit his lip as he remembered the way the house had been so willing to let Weasley take the blame. "Not specifically, sir."

Snape's eyes narrowed. "Explain."

"Well... I don't know why anyone might have attacked Tracey specifically. If it's a Slytherin behind the attacks though... well, attacking another Slytherin might pin the blame on different house."

"A... very well-reasoned hypothesis," Snape said after a time. "Do you have any other brilliant suggestions to narrow down the field of suspects?" Harry shook his head. "Very well," said Snape.

Harry expected to be dismissed, but Snape did not immediately grant him leave. "I am aware that you were present the night Neville Longbottom met his demise."

Harry felt as though somebody had injected icy water straight into his veins. It seemed to flow through him and cool his blood by twenty degrees.

"Do calm down," Snape continued, "I have no intention of spreading the fact to the public." He sneered. "If you fear my suspicion, I think your involvement in Longbottom's death about as likely as your involvement in this fiasco. Which, for your information, I deem to be about as possible as either of your parents rising up from their graves."

"Then why are you questioning me, sir?" Harry wasn't sure what made him ask the question. It was bold and probably foolish, but it sprang to his tongue and he could not help but part his lips and allow it to flow free.

Snape's lip curled. "Because as much as I often despise the fact, my job description necessitates I do more than brew potions in this dungeon and pretend that the insufferable occupants of this castle do not exist." The man's expression hardened. "If you plan to ask why I am making a point of informing you of all I know, it is because I wish to warn you, Potter. Rushing headlong into every situation will get you killed much faster than your hair-brained father." There was a pause during which Snape seemed to wait for a reaction, but Harry did not grant him one. "And when you put yourself into situations which make it *look* as though you have done so, you may see yourself on the wrong side of a prison cell door faster than your good-for-nothing godfather."

***A Balcony Overlooking the Hogwarts Grounds***

***4:34 PM***

The past twenty-four hours had been the most trying of the year for Harry. He had dealt with the scorn of the Gryffindors ever since Colin Creevey had turned up petrified, but this was an entirely new level.

News of his absence from the common room around the time of the attack on Tracey had somehow spread throughout the school. Harry wasn't sure who exactly had snitched, but he supposed it didn't really matter. There were a whole myriad of upper year students who would gladly have spread the news around in hopes that his life would become a living hell.

There was a significant portion of the school that had been skeptical of his involvement before Tracey went missing, but now many of them seemed convinced that Harry's innocence was merely a facade. He already missed the days when he could walk through the corridors unaccosted, but he now found himself missing the days when the only spells flung towards him were ones without intent to cause long-term harm.

It was all quite exhausting, and that was to say nothing of what was going on inside of Slytherin House.

Daphne had not spoken a word all day. The usually outgoing girl seemed to have drawn into herself. She had even been quiet all throughout classes. Harry wanted to talk to her, but he had no idea how. He liked Tracey and was disappointed she had been attacked, but Daphne was much closer to her. Harry had never had a friend that close, so he had no idea how it must feel. Blaise was as stoic as ever whilst Millicent and Lillian seemed to be in similar headspaces to Daphne.

Classes had just wrapped up and Harry had practically fled from the common room. The tense dynamic was driving him mad and he needed some air after the day he had been having.

He donned his invisibility cloak and slipped through the hall unimpeded. It was a nice feeling to avoid the spells for the first time in weeks, though he had to move slowly. He couldn't risk bumping into anyone --- the cloak was the most useful tool he had in his admittedly limited arsenal. The last thing he wanted was for someone to discover he had the tool in the first place. That would only mean the tool would become much less practical for him to use.

His feet carried him through a hidden passage and up a set of stairs concealed behind an ancient tapestry. He had put no thought into the matter, but he was standing atop the same balcony he had spoken with Diana several times.

The already cloudy sky was growing darker far above. It seemed as though a dark cloud of grey was spreading outwards and consuming the light of the sky. Harry felt something wet run down his face and nearly jumped before he realized what it was. The first snowfall of the year had arrived in the Scottish highlands. The flakes fell slowly, but they were thick and seemed like a white veil as they fell. Harry knew that that next morning he would wake to at least a light dusting of snow painting the grass white, even if it didn't last.

"I've always liked snow."

Some time ago, Harry might have jumped, but he was becoming much more comfortable with other people and much harder to scare. "How is it we always seem to end up talking up here?"

Diana laughed lightly as she stepped up beside him and peered down at the grounds sprawled out far below. "Because we're both human beings who need breaks. It just so happens that we like to take them in the same place."

Harry snorted. "It was either this or go and explore the castle."

"You do that a lot, don't you?"

He shrugged. "More during the last few weeks, but yeah. It's a hobby of mine."

"I imagine *that* makes it easy." Harry wondered what she meant for a moment before she gestured to the silvery cloak pooled at his feet.

Oh... bollocks!

He had been so careful whilst moving through the halls, only to allow the cloak to slide off of him and lay at his feet and in plain sight. He had become so distracted by the scenery that he had allowed his concentration to lapse. This was bad. He hadn't even told Draco about the cloak during the peak of their friendship. He wanted to trust Diana --- she seemed the most trustworthy person he had met so far in the magical world --- but he was unsure if he could.

*"The Malfoys might view you as a tool, but that doesn't mean all of us do."*

Harry needed to get to the bottom of his situation with the Malfoys. He had decided by now that Lucius had probably been manipulating him and Draco, but what of Diana and Narcissa? He wanted to trust both of them, but he wasn't sure he could. It was something he needed to figure out at some point in the near future. Living with the uncertainty was not only massively inconvenient, it was also exceedingly stressful.

"Don't worry," said Diana, looking at him closely. Harry realized some of his inner conflict must have shown on his face. Diana had clearly interpreted it as him being worried about the cloak. She wasn't wrong, he supposed, she was just less right than she suspected. "I won't tell anyone about the cloak. This explains a lot, actually. How you seem to know the castle better than almost anyone I know, how you just slip away sometimes, how you manage to come back to the common room ages after curfew without being caught." Her eyes drifted back down towards the cloak. "May I ask where you got it?"

"It was my father's," Harry answered. He supposed that there was really no point in lying now. If Diana knew he had it, it hardly mattered if she knew how he had come by the cloak in the first place. He would leave out the bit about Dumbledore sending it to him, but the rest...

Diana was looking at him strangely. "It was... your father's?" He nodded. "Harry... invisibility cloaks aren't supposed---"

"Aren't supposed to last for more than five or so years? Yeah, I know; I looked them up in the library ages ago. I don't get it either, but the cloak is perfect. It's never not worked the way it's supposed to."

Better than it was supposed to, maybe. He thought back to the way Voldemort had tried to detect him and failed until he had blown off Harry's cloak with some sort of magical wind. Whether invisibility cloaks were supposed to prevent detection charms from working or not, Harry had no idea. If they weren't... well, that only added to the mystery and it was at least one ace he could keep up his sleeve for a little bit longer.

"I've never heard of anything like it," Diana admitted. "I've heard of especially powerful cloaks lasting close to a decade, but if that was your father's... it's at least **twelve-**years-old."

"It's definitely older. He had it while he was at Hogwarts. It's at least fifteen-years-old, I'd say."

"That shouldn't be possible." Diana's fingers were drumming rhythmically on the balcony's railing as she stared up into the steadily darkening sky. Flakes of snow were nestling themselves in her long blonde hair, but she seemed to neither notice nor care.

Harry had not put a great deal of thought into his cloak as of late. It had been a mystery he had spent some time researching in his first year, but that had been before he had been traumatized by the collective efforts of two dark lords. He had been a touch distracted ever since.

It actually sounded like an interesting project to distract himself with again, though he knew it would require him to sneak into the Restricted Section. This time, he would be much more careful not to anger any of the books that could scream so loud it made his eardrums want to burst. Finding the Mirror of Erised had been interesting, but he did not cherish the idea of sprinting through the halls to escape the horrible screams again. He wondered what happened to the mirror after Neville's death, but he quickly made up his mind to move on.

*"It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live,\"* Dumbledore had said. They were words Harry was taking seriously. If he didn't, he might well and truly be mad by now.

Diana shook her head slowly as if to clear it. "I guess the cloak doesn't really matter. It's just... strange. Anyway, how are you handling everything?"

"I'm handling it," said Harry. "It's really just more of the same. The curses are more brutal and there are more of them, but it's the same thing I've been dealing with ever since Creevey got attacked."

"Is it still mostly the Gryffindors?"

"Mostly, but there are some Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws, too. No Slytherins in public, obviously, but some of the upper years would still love to curse me in the back. They probably would if not for Daphne and maybe my spot on the Quidditch team."

"They would still curse you even with you being on the team," said Diana. "They would just make sure their spell was reversed before the next match."

Harry laughed despite himself. It was a painfully apt description of the house of cunning. "Lovely. Well, here's to hoping none of them actually try it."

"Just spend more time under that cloak. If I had one of those, I'd probably spend most of the day under it. I've been meaning to try and learn the Disillusionment Charm, but it's not as solid as an actual invisibility cloak."

Harry tilted his head. "The... what charm?"

"Disillusionment Charm. It's a sort of camouflage spell. It lets you blend in so seamlessly with your surroundings that if you're standing still, you might as well be invisible."

*"If you will forgive my lack of modesty for a moment, I do not need a cloak to become invisible."*

Harry wondered whether or not this had been the spell Dumbledore had cast over himself that night or whether he had used something completely different. If it was this, he had exaggerated things. The spell seemed useful, but it was far from true, unimpeded invisibility. Harry would be sticking to his cloak for the foreseeable future.

"Maybe I'll take your advice on that," he said thoughtfully. Spending more of his day invisible really didn't sound unappealing. "I'm all right, though. I just needed a bit of air."

Diana smiled. "It does help, doesn't it?" She looked back towards the castle. "Have you had enough of it?" Harry nodded and followed her back inside.

***November 30, 1991***

***The Dungeons***

***9:09 AM***

Harry had taken Diana's advice and spent much of the day hidden under the cloak. Daphne was still strangely distant with him, so he had felt no real need to spend much time with the group. He'd spent the week wandering the castle and exploring the Restricted Section. He had yet to find any explanation regarding his cloak, but he had found a number of interesting tomes that contained spells the likes of which he had never imagined before. Some he had seen in some of the more recent memories Grindelwald was feeding him. He had been witnessing his first few years at Durmstrang recently and near the end of his second year, Grindelwald had begun looking into some... interesting bits of magic.

Today was the final day of classes for the week and the Slytherins and Gryffindors were congregated outside the Potions Classroom, waiting. Weasley was conversing in a low voice with Granger, but Harry could see Draco making his way towards them and knew things could get ugly fast.

"Drop the act, Weasley," drawled Draco. "Why bother pretending that you don't know who the Heir is? You're embarrassing yourself."

Weasley's face turned red as a fierce blush rose up his cheeks. "Stuff it, Malfoy. I know you and the rest of your group of gits were the ones who came up with that stupid song."

Draco staggered back, clasping his chest as though it had been pierced by a dagger. "Don't you like it, Weasley? We all spent so much time making sure it was perfect. I can try and make it better, if you'd like? Anything for a man doing good and honest work." He sneered at Granger. "I'll let you write the thing yourself if I don't have to see her stupid teeth any time---"

Draco's sentence was cut off when Weasley flung himself forward. Draco reached for his wand, but Weasley was on top of him before he could draw it. Crabbe and Goyle stepped forward to take hold of Weasley, but Thomas and Finnigan had drawn their wands. Harry gripped his, but hesitated. He remembered the Cutting Curse he'd struck Weasley with earlier in the year. The problem was that he also remembered the numerous nights he had spent in detention with the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor as the man tried and failed to goad Harry into killing the lamb each night. Every time his wand would raise, he would remember the horrible voice he'd heard inside his own head that first night and the way it had screamed for blood.

A spell blasted Weasley and Draco apart. They went rolling away from each other with each of their robes having been ruffled. Weasley was the first to his feet. Blood was trickling from his nose as he glared hatefully towards Draco, whose lip was split and who looked every bit as livid.

"What is going on here?"

Everyone looked around to see the very unimpressed visage of Professor Snape as he glared at the lot of them.

"Weasley attacked me, sir," said Draco.

"You bloody---"

"Ten points from Gryffindor, Weasley." Snape waved his wand twice and healed both boys' injuries. "Now, everyone, inside. Despite your exhaustive efforts to disrupt each and every single one of your peers, there is still a class to attend."

As they all stepped inside the room, Harry couldn't help but notice that the way Weasley and Granger whispered back and forth seemed much more animated than it had been before. What was even stranger were the odd glances that Granger occasionally threw in his direction before flicking her eyes towards Draco and then averting her stare altogether.

***December 7, 1992***

***The Great Hall***

***8:37 AM***

Snow had officially taken up its annual residency upon the grounds of Hogwarts. The ground was solid and it gleamed with the sparkle of the white powder that coated it. It was a bright and sunny day and the rays of sun shining down from the ceiling high above sparkled off of the plates and made the spoons, forks, and knives glitter like strangely shaped gemstones.

Harry wanted to glare up at the sky for daring to mock him. Many around the hall were in high spirits, but not Harry. Today was the day the heads of house went around to their pupils and collected the names of everyone who would be staying at Hogwarts over the winter holidays. It was a reminder for many that soon they would be back home with their families. For Harry, it was a reminder that the blasted Dursleys still lorded power over him. Lucius Malfoy had promised him during the summer that would change, but he had heard nothing on that front. Perhaps it had been another one of the manipulations Daphne had accused him of.

He glanced towards Daphne now, but little had changed since Tracey's petrification. She seemed to speak only when spoken to. The charisma that seemed to ooze from her at all hours of the day appeared to have dried up or else leaked out of her. It was still odd seeing her this way and Harry didn't like it, but he did not dare get involved in this mess. Not after how poorly his first year had ended when he had tried to do too much.

Vast, dense clouds temporarily blocked the sunlight as hundreds of owls streamed into the hall with the morning's post. Hedwig was easily visible among them since she shone every bit as white as the snow outside.

She greeted Harry with a hoot when she landed in front of him. She nipped his finger briefly before fixing her beady eyes intently on a plate of bacon not far down the table. Harry allowed his lips to curve upwards as he snatched a piece and fed it to his bird. He glanced down at his bit of mail and saw that it was from Narcissa. He would read it later, he decided. Their letters had become more personal. The last thing he wanted was some older Slytherin to see what it was they were writing about. They take it for a weakness. If they did, they might be stupid enough to think they could use it against him.

Harry turned back towards his cup of pumpkin juice only to find that someone had taken it. Hardly surprising, he supposed. It had still been full and he had become distracted. Some older Slytherin had probably just swiped it on their way past. It was likely that they hadn't even realized who it was they were taking it from.

"Here, Harry, take this one." It was strange to hear Daphne talk so willingly. It had happened so scarcely that Harry was startled for half a heartbeat before he reached out and took the glass of pumpkin juice from her.

"Thanks, Daph---"

His eyes widened as his hand almost went slack. It took a conscious effort to keep a hold on the glass as he peered down at it as though it was some kind of artifact that had fallen from outer space.

He cast his eyes numbly from the glass in his hands to the chain that hung about his neck --- the very chain that Regulus Black had given him for his twelfth birthday... the chain that had heated up and that was glowing a faint red colour.

*"So long as you're wearing it, it will detect any poisons before you drink. It's never been known to be wrong and it's not stingy about what it classifies as a poison. If it can cause you harm, the chain will warn you."*

Shock washed over Harry.

Poison?! Daphne had tried to poison him?!

It had to be Daphne. She had handed him the cup and she had already proven herself more than capable of it in the past.

But... why?

Complete and total disbelief clung to Harry like perspiration as he stared towards Daphne and met her eyes. Her expression was blank as she looked back at him, her eyes devoid of any and all emotion.

The fingers Harry had wrapped around the glass began to tremble. He had been so sure he'd found a friend in Daphne, and then this of all things had happened. Was he destined to never have a friend? Dudley had seen to that whilst he lived on Privet Drive, but even in the magical world, he had known nothing but betrayal.

No, he thought, that wasn't true; he was making things out to be a touch worse than they were. Diana had never betrayed him... or had she?

The plates and goblets around Harry began to shake as though a tremor had run through the rock cliff that the castle sat atop. Harry knew he would explode if he stayed. The shock was beginning to wane now and give way to other emotions. There was so much hurt, anger, and betrayal rising up within him that he wasn't sure he wouldn't use the Cutting Curse again... or worse --- he had learned worse since. Yet if he did this time... he wasn't sure his aim would be to create a simple cut.

If Harry sat in a chair instead of resting upon the wooden benches all students occupied, the force with which he stood would have sent it careening backwards. As it was, he was on his feet and storming out the door as a red sort of haze seemed to cloud his vision as a similar-coloured tinge of anger seemed to touch every inch of his skin as he began to shake. He hardly noticed that he was still holding the goblet in his hand, though he noticed her stare. He felt it as he left the hall and knew without turning around that Daphne had not taken her eyes off of him since Harry had laid a hand on the goblet.

***Durmstrang Institute***

***8:44 PM***

Gellert absentmindedly cast yet another Warming Charm as he glanced back down at the sheet of parchment he held. He was seated in his years' barracks, located in one of the castle's many towers. The tower itself was made from rough grey stone, but the wind had weathered the walls over time, smoothing over harsh, jutting edges. It seemed as though the rock had thinned, for the biting cold managed to seep through cracks and permeate the air inside. There had been a period of time during his first year when Gellert had spent hours each day huddled under the thin and ragged blanket the school provided, but those days had passed the second the Warming Charm had become nearly as instinctual to him as breathing.

There were no windows in the barracks, but he could hear the wind whistling outside and picture the snow blowing in pale drifts across the expansive grounds. Sometimes, the wind kicked up so much of it that it appeared like a shimmering white fog.

He glanced back down at the parchments and read once more. He was nearly through his third year at Durmstrang and things were about to change.

*Herr Grindelwald,*

*Congratulations on completing your first three years at Durmstrang Institute. Fourth-year students enter into an altered, more specialized curriculum with branching classes for each of the major subjects. You may take as many classes as you would like. Attendance at every class is not mandatory, but please note that it is the responsibility of the student to keep their in-class performance at an acceptable standard. It is not the obligation of the professor to ensure students keep up to date in their classes.*

*Please send in your choices by the end of this school year.*

*Regards,*

*Ilyn Shevchenko*

*Highmaster*

Gellert's eyes gleamed as they scanned over some of his potential options. He was already taking a few of them, having tested ahead in several of his classes, but he had been limited in which branches of magic the school would allow him to study before the end of his third year.

Now though... Now he was free. Not only could he choose his standard electives, but he would be able to test out of less challenging classes more freely and pursue the magic he was most interested in.

Now was when the true beginning of his education would arrive and when he would start taking real strides for the first time.

All the cold that had filled him to the brim was gone now. It had been purged from his body by the warm glow of excitement and anticipation. It had consumed the cold as though it was little more than a well-prepared pyre laid bare before an open flame.

This was what being a wizard was really about. It was all of this that made all those years in the muggle world worth it. It was all of this that made the hell they had put him through worth it. It was all of this that might one day allow him to set everything right.

Harry barely even flinched anymore after being exposed to another of Grindelwald's memories. Ever since he had witnessed his arrival at Durmstrang, the memories had drastically increased in regularity. He had lived through much of Grindelwald's first three years of school. Not through every class, but he saw the significant events. He had seen him jump a year ahead in his Dark Arts class from the onset and now that his electives had opened up, Harry was sure Grindelwald would skip yet another year. The boy was nearly as talented in Transfiguration as he was in the Dark Arts. Watching his work made Harry realize he needed to put more time into that branch of magic himself. He had grown this year by leaps and bounds in his combat ability, but he needed to make sure he progressed at the same rate in other classes.

In a strange way, the memories were helping with that. He may not have been sitting through the classes with Grindelwald, but he did see him work from time to time. There had been some transfigurations Harry had never seen before that he now at least knew the incantation, wand movement, and necessary process for. Whether he could perform them or not remained to be seen, but he had the necessary pieces.

And curses... he had picked up a startling number of curses.

Grindelwald had made few friends at Durmstrang so far, but he was revered by some of the students in his Dark Arts class. They may have been a year older, but it was clear who the top student was. Many of them flocked to Grindelwald and the boy had taken full advantage of it. He and his companions had worked with some older students to arrange for a sort of duelling circuit at the school outside of classes. It took place out on the grounds in the dead of night and was brutal. Durmstrang in general was lax in terms of enforcing its rules, but these duels... the only rule, as far as Harry could tell, was to avoid killing each other if at all possible.

Harry had found himself wishing more than once he had gone to Durmstrang. Hogwarts was his first home and any time he really thought about it, he knew he wouldn't trade the ancient castle for anything, but by Merlin did Durmstrang have its merits.

The curriculum was demanding, but the way they encouraged excellence and allowed students to test ahead... it was something he thought would have been a boon to him. It would almost certainly have sped him along in the wanded subjects even more so than he was already. He wished Hogwarts taught like Durmstrang every time he watched the memories. He had seen through the dreams that many students failed to keep up with the classes and ended up dropping out of the school altogether, but Harry wouldn't have cared. If students couldn't keep up, that was their own problem. It wasn't something he would ever have to worry about, so he wouldn't have been troubled by such things.

He ran a hand through his hair as he sat up in bed. He wondered for what must have been the thousandth time why Grindelwald was showing him all of this. He suspected there was a motive, yet nothing seemed fabricated. Everything Harry had been shown seemed authentic and he wondered what the former dark lord was playing at. Perhaps to turn him against muggles and sway Harry towards his cause?

If that was his goal... was it working?

Harry shook his head --- it was best not to think about such things. He could instinctually tell that the time at which he normally rose was drawing near, so he stood from his bed and reached for his clothes. Better to get an early start on the day than to wallow in thoughts that worried him more than any others.

***The Out of Order Girls' Bathroom on the Second Floor***

***6:56 PM***

Ron wrinkled his nose the second Hermione led him across the bathroom's threshold. It had been out of order for a great deal of time and did not suffer from the kind of stench one might expect. Instead, moisture floated thickly in the air --- like it had polluted the place instead of the foulness of human waste.

The lower portions of the walls looked weathered and as though they had bore the brunt of a hundred mighty storms. The room smelled of mold and algae; Ron had no doubt he would find it growing in the cracks on the walls if he cared to look. A thin sheet of water blanketed the floor. It was as undisturbed as the smooth surface of a lake on a warm summer's day until the two second-year Gryffindors stepped into the room and sent ripples cascading through the shallow layer of water.

"Bloody hell," cursed Ron. "Hermione, why in Merlin's name would you take me here? We have the Knight's Room, and... this is a *girl's* bathroom." The Knight's Room was what their little practice group had taken to calling the room hidden behind the suit of armour that they all used to practice and meet up. "This place is a ruin."

"Which is exactly why no one will think to check it." Hermione wrinkled her nose. "Well... that and Moaning Myrtle."

"Come again?"

"She's a horrible ghost. She spends most of her time shrieking like she's died again --- I've never seen anyone so miserable. She haunts this bathroom, but she sometimes floats down into some of the others. It's an awful scare any time Myrtle just floats in and starts wailing."

"Right," said Ron. "Remind me why we're here again? Nobody's ever found us in the Knight's Room."

"You told me that you thought Malfoy might be behind the petrifications, remember?"

Ron's expression darkened. "Yeah, I do. The git's been trying to blame me all year and he was the first to go shouting off about it when Mrs. Norris showed up petrified. Same thing when Colin was attacked."

"Exactly," said Hermione. "I don't disagree with you, like I said, but the problem is proving it. Nobody is just going to expel the son of Lucius Malfoy without proof."

"I get it, but what does this place have to do with proving Malfoy's going around petrifying people?"

"You remember earlier today when I asked you to make a distraction in Potions so I could grab a few things?" Ron nodded. "Well, I was doing that because I found out a way for us to work out if Malfoy's up to something." She bit her bottom lip and seemed all of a sudden reluctant to meet Ron's eyes. "It's... risky and against the rules. If we get caught, we'll be in horrible trouble---"

"Oh, get to the point."

Hermione huffed. "Fine. The point is that I found a recipe for a potion that might help. It's called Polyjuice Potion."

Ron's eyes went so wide one might think they were fit to burst from their sockets. "Polyjuice Potion? You're sure?" She nodded. "Blimey, that's supposed to be super complicated. Rare, too, and\... well, really expensive."

"It is," Hermione admitted meekly.

A wave of raw reality slammed into Ron with the force of a cyclone. "Hold on, Hermione, where the hell did you find a recipe for Polyjuice Potion? It's really illegal, Percy's said as much loads of times; I doubt anyone would just leave it lying around."

Her cheeks flushed so red that Ron thought they were beginning to resemble his Quidditch jersey. She was looking anywhere but at him and he was all at once certain she was hiding something.

"I don't know," she finally answered. "I just... did."

She wasn't going to provide him with any more clarity on the matter; Ron was certain of that much, at least. "Fine," he said. "How do you plan to make Polyjuice? The ingredients are supposed to be really rare and---"

Hermione reached into her pockets and withdrew a number of vials, cutting Ron short. "We're at Hogwarts, Ron. I doubt there's a larger store of potion ingredients anywhere in Britain other than some of the top apothecaries. I wasn't sure Professor Snape would have all of the ingredients, but he did. This might be the only place in the country where I could find all of them."

Something in the back of Ron's mind was nudging at him. It was whispering things to him, singing about exactly how convenient this all was. It really did seem too easy and it bordered on unnatural, but Ron decided to let it go. After the nightmares that had befallen them last year and the horrors of this one so far, he supposed the world had just finally decided it owed the both of them a break.

***December 12, 1992***

***Aberforth Dumbledore's Office***

***9:37 PM***

Harry stared blankly at the lamb lying before him. He would have grown bored long ago had waves of frustration not been crashing inside of him since the moment he'd stepped foot in the room. It happened every time he had one of these detentions. Frustration, anger, bitterness, loathing --- it all boiled up inside of him and threatened to spew forth in one vicious bout every time he felt his restraint begin to waver.

This detention had been like many others, but worse. Just like all that had come before it, Harry had entered the room, curtly greeted Aberforth, turned towards the lamb, and refused to do anything whilst the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor marked essays or did whatever the hell the old codger was doing whilst Harry stared dully at a lamb.

What had made this night more agonizing was the fact that all of the negative feelings were so much stronger. He had been in a piss-poor mood ever since Daphne had tried to poison him. Harry had made it back to the dormitory that morning before he'd realized he was still holding the poisoned glass of pumpkin juice. He had poured it into potion vials and hid them in his trunk. He still wasn't entirely sure he wouldn't take them to Professor Snape for examination, but he didn't trust the man in the slightest. Had that fact been untrue, he might well have marched to the man's office that very morning.

He had hidden under the cloak for most of the time since and spent a vast majority of it in the library. The Restricted Section, in particular, had been where he had dwelled most often whilst he wallowed in this most recent betrayal.

Harry was really getting sick of people doing that. First it had been his own family. They were supposed to care for him, yet they had abused and neglected Harry ever since he was a child. All of his teachers growing up were no better. If he were to count them, he would be sitting in this old goat's office all night. He'd thought he had finally made friends when his first year at Hogwarts had commenced, but he had been proven mostly wrong once again. Draco had betrayed him not once, but twice. Theodore still occasionally snuck into the library to catch up with Harry, but he was the only one in his old group of friends who did. He had caught Pansy stealing sad glances towards him on more days than not, but they meant nothing without action.

Daphne had been the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel of darkness and despair he'd trudged through after his relationship with Draco had crumbled. She had helped him in Potions, been someone he was genuinely fond of, welcomed him into an enjoyable group of friends, protected him from the upper years via her name alone, and even led him to realize what at least one of the Malfoys had likely been doing all along. She had even taken revenge on Darren Travers for him. It had been nothing but a long string of positive experiences with Daphne... until Tracey had gone missing.

She had been quiet and withdrawn after that, but Harry had thought it was natural. Daphne was the most intelligent person he had ever met and he had assumed she was quietly calculating exactly who was behind everything, or else how best to strike back at them, or maybe even both. He had expected anything along those lines and maybe even something different.

What he had not expected was for her to slip him a goblet full of poison. Exactly what was in the pumpkin juice, he still had no idea. A part of him didn't want to find out. She had betrayed him and irrevocably shattered the trust they'd once had. It didn't matter how badly she had betrayed him; it was the principle that mattered.

He had isolated himself alongside his sorrow and misery ever since and it had not helped his mood. He could feel that tonight, his patience was thinner than the frail sheet of ice that was beginning to creep its way across the surface of the great Black Lake.

He heard the rustling of parchment from behind him. It sounded like a long cloak brushing against fallen autumn leaves. He turned; usually, Aberforth did not so much as look up from his work until the hour had grown late and curfew had long-since passed.

The professor was looking at him. Perhaps Harry should have averted his eyes, but he met the old man's stare with steadfast spite. "Sir?"

Aberforth snorted. "Don't sir me, boy." He glanced about the room before letting his stare find Harry once more. "We've been at this long enough. The both of us know you're capable of killing the thing. Get it over with, will you? I'm tired of this; it's lasted long enough."

Harry felt as though he had just fallen and smacked his head against the floor. The words of his professor reached him, but it was as though they were distorted and came from far away. He was having a difficult time processing exactly what the words meant.

"Sir, I don't---"

"Don't tell me you don't understand." Aberforth's expression was as hard and unyielding as unforged iron. "What's the matter, boy? You'll petrify a cat but you won't attack a lamb?"

Pain seemed to flare into being inside Harry's chest. It was like someone had stabbed him in the heart with a dagger and then lit it ablaze and let the flames spread outwards, burning through muscle and flesh with no regard as they went.

The fire appeared to have risen to his eyes --- that same, reddish haze that had been present after Daphne had tried to poison him was tinging the corners of his vision.

"Sir," Harry said, using his limited Occlumency the best he could to keep all emotions in check, "I never petrified Mrs. Norris."

"Of course not. The same way you definitely didn't attack the boy who was harassing you hours before he went missing."

Harry couldn't believe what he was hearing. "So what then, Professor?" His voice dripped with venom as he hurled Aberforth's title at him as if it was a poisoned arrow. "Do you think I attacked one of my best friends right after?"

The professor's answer was a shrug. "Good way to throw everyone off your trail." He leant forward and seemed to watch Harry closely. "I also don't see you hanging about with Greengrass and her posse anymore. Might be that they think the same as me."

Harry almost staggered. The blow was more impactful than any physical spell ever could have been.

Was that why Daphne had tried to poison him? Did she think he had attacked Tracey? How the hell could she ever believe he had attacked Tracey? And this man? Albus Dumbledore's brother --- the man who had been tormenting Harry with these sick, twisted detentions for months? He was so sick of them, so sick of it, so sick of everything.

He had just enough restraint left to spin on his heel before the curse formed fully on his tongue and his wand took aim at Aberforth. The old prick would have made for a more satisfying target, but it also would have caused many more problems.

"Lacero!"

A jagged jet of purple light careened from the tip of Harry's wand. It was a dark curse according to many people and Harry had never cast it before. He had seen Grindelwald use it in duels at Durmstrang to great effect after learning it in a book in the school's library. Harry had tracked down the same book in English in the Hogwarts library and studied the spell for himself. He had never imagined he would be using it so soon.

The lamb had not been looking at Harry, but it must have sensed the reaper's fingers stretching out towards it, for it looked up at the last possible second with wide and innocent eyes. They were a deep brown colour that practically cried of kindness and love. They reminded Harry so painful of Longbottom's panicked eyes in that corridor last June. Harry wondered if Aberforth had made sure the creature was as innocent-looking as he possibly could. It seemed exactly the sort of sadistic trick the man would play.

The majestic scene of innocence was ruined not a second later when the spell found its mark. Harry's aim was true and the lamb was halfway through a long and curious bleat when the purple light found its target. The sound escaping from its mouth became raspy and choked as Harry's spell tore through wool, skin, flesh, and bone. The choked, gurgling sound that had become the creature's final lament was cut short by a dull thud as its severed head hit the floor and rolled to lay unmoving at Harry's feet.

Its eyes were still open, but the warmth and colour was gone. They were like glass now and Harry could not help but think of how the creature was now broken. He thought it a mockery; nothing so broken should have eyes so smooth and whole, even if they were lifeless. He thought it would have been more apt if they had resembled a shattered sheet of glass, but the sight did not hold his attention long.

His gaze fell upon the lamb's body and his heart nearly skipped a beat. Something about it was sickly familiar. It made bile rise in the back of his throat, but he knew it would not come up. He felt like Grindelwald had felt in his dream all those years ago while the smoke rose up in great plumes all around him. Every muscle in his throat seemed to have contracted. The last thing it appeared to desire was air. Perhaps karma truly was real, Harry thought. Maybe this was the world starving him of oxygen for killing something so pure and defenceless.

Blood was running from the gaping chasm where the creature's head had once rested. It was flowing fast in all directions. It was stretching out this way and that like a crimson web of woven silk or cracked rock spreading outwards as more and more of its surface gave way. Much of the blood was flowing onto the stone floor. The grey rock was darkening rapidly. It was as though the blood was a dark-red dye meant to add some flavour to the dull grey stone.

None of that held Harry's attention.

What held him captive was the blood that flowed in the other direction.

It ran swiftly over the creature's woollen coat. The red was so vivid against the pale wool that Harry could see every droplet as it flowed across its surface. The imagery was familiar. He had seen something similar once through the eyes of another. The day Wylla Nurmen had been put to death... the way her blood had stained the pale white snow. It was the same here. It was too much the same... it made Harry want to gag and vomit but his throat would not allow it.

"Got there in the end, didn't we?" Harry whirled to face the professor. He was no longer seeing red. He felt nothing at all as he turned, which was dangerous. If the anger returned to him, he wasn't sure he would have the restraint necessary to not curse this monster of a man. Yet he somehow knew anger would not rise --- not yet. That would come soon but for now, there was nothing. "Three bloody months we spent at this," the man grumbled. "If I knew all it would take was some goading, I'd have done it ages ago."

Harry had been wrong --- the anger was there. It was rising again and he was shaking. This man had accused him of attacking one of his best friends and made him question everything just to goad him into firing that damned curse?

Harry spun and made for the door, but the professor's voice called after him. "Not yet, Potter; I haven't told you to leave. Walk out now and you'll be in this room every Saturday until the day I die." Harry took a deep breath and exerted every bit of his Occlumency to keep himself calm as he turned. Even so, he was still shaking.

"It doesn't feel nice, does it?" asked Aberforth. "That was a lamb, Potter. Now imagine if that curse had hit a boy." He left the obvious unsaid. "However awful you feel now, it would be a hundred times worse. There are consequences to your actions and you need to consider them. Next time you want to curse a fellow student, think about how it felt when that spell tore through the lamb's throat. Maybe that will give you pause." The man's face was impassive as he asked his next question. "Where exactly did you learn that spell?"

"In a book." Aberforth continued to watch him closely for a moment before nodding towards the door. Harry left at once. Perhaps the man thought he was shaking from the horror of what he had just done, but Harry knew it was from anger.

He had been disturbed for a moment. When the image had been so reminiscent of Wylla Nurmen's death... it had disturbed him. But when anger had taken over, that image meant something different --- something terrifying.

Harry had not felt horror at killing the lamb. Until he had imagined Wylla's blood, it hadn't even bothered him. And once he had and put thought into it, he realized her blood did not make him regret speaking the incantation and moving his wand. It simply made him furious that no one had done the same thing to every single person who had thrown a stone that winter's day all those years ago.

Harry's legs were still shaking by the time the wall parted and admitted him back into the Slytherin common room. After all that had just happened, he almost expected there to be another attack. It would be so typical for everything to happen all at once. Naturally, he would somehow be blamed again, which at this point might lead him to become homicidal.

Looking at Daphne might have given that same feeling cause to arise, so he avoided doing that. It had become a habit since the attempted poisoning, but he looked at nobody as he crossed the common room, his eyes staring unblinkingly at the dark tunnel leading to the dormitories on the room's other side. The air was no more tense than usual, so Harry took comfort in the fact that the stress of the night was at its end. Except for dreams, he supposed... that might well prove to be another matter altogether.

"Harry! Watch out!"

He reacted instinctively. Pansy's voice sounded through the room and he didn't think twice. He threw himself forward and to the floor. With his head down, he didn't see the spell miss him, but he could hear it crackling through the air. He rolled and avoided another spell as he took to his feet. His eyes widened when he saw the third. It was the same spell that he had just used on the lamb... and it was aimed at his chest.

Harry hardly realized he was moving as he sidestepped the curse and slid his wand into his hand. He was too lost to the haze of red that had not entirely receded by the time he had entered the common room. There was a small part of him that realized he could suppress the pent-up wave of fury, stress, frustration, and whatever the hell else he was dealing with. Or, keep it at bay, at the very least, but he made yet another decision that he would later look back upon with a great deal of uncertainty.

He chose to let it rule him. It flowed through every part of him and filled him like the warmth one experiences after a deep gulp of wine.

The spell sailed past him and Harry countered with a Stunner and a Cutting Curse. His opponent dodged the first and shielded the second. Only when he was forced to shield and pause momentarily beneath one of the magical spheres of light did Harry recognize him. His blond hair gleamed like ghostly fire in the magical light and his eyes seemed paler than usual.

It was Cadmus Yaxley, Cassie's younger brother.

If Harry was thinking more rationally, several things might have sprung to mind. The way the boy had seemed to wish him harm the last time they had been this close to each other, the fact that he probably shouldn't do too much harm to Cassie's younger brother, or even the fact that the Yaxleys were all renowned duellists and despite being a first year, Cadmus may be more trouble than Harry was anticipating.

He thought none of these things.

He thought almost nothing at all as he dodged, shielded, countered, and advanced. Yaxley's eyes had gleamed with a malevolent sort of cruelty when the duel had begun, but they were dimming fast and growing wider and wider as spell after spell accosted him. They were coming with the frequency of rain drops caught up in a ruthless wind and hurled against the nearest set of walls. The boy was stumbling back under Harry's assault, clearly unprepared for the task before him. Harry felt a small amount of pleasure and amusement as the boy backed up. It was muted and trapped beneath everything else he was feeling, but he could only guess that the boy had suspected he would be easy prey for a Yaxley.

He was a good duellist, Harry had to admit. Cadmus was miles better than any first year had any right to be. He would have beaten Harry a year ago, he was sure, but time had passed and Harry had not been idle. Cadmus would likely have beaten any other second year, but Harry was not just a talented second year. If McGonagall and Flitwick were to be believed, he was much more than that and Cadmus was learning it first-hand whilst Harry enjoyed every second of it.

Duelling with Theodore, Draco, and the others had been fun in a way, but those exchanges had always been so light. Duelling with Cassie was riveting, but frustrating. This... this was different. There was no holding back, no honour code, and Harry wasn't duelling someone years older than him or whom he liked. He could take satisfaction at every inch of worry upon the boy's face without guilt as he rained spell after spell down upon him.

Yaxley lunged to the side and snarled as he fired a white spell towards Harry that he recognized at once, though only from seeing it in one of Grindelwald's memories. It was a spell that would leave the victim completely blind until the counter curse was cast, yet even that was not its true evil. It was said that the burning behind the eyes was so intense that those afflicted were known to rip their own eyes from their skulls.

And just like that, the duel was no longer fun. It was no longer a duel at all, but a fight, and Harry was going to use everything at his disposal --- secrets and consequences be damned. He was not thinking about what would happen if he resorted to the idea that had taken shape in his mind. He was not thinking about what it would mean or of what would stem from it. He would think later and perhaps regret, but for now, he saw only red and desired only victory.

As a jet of red light that Harry recognized as a Stunner flew near, he sidestepped and lashed out with his wand. His projected tendril of magic caught the stunner just as it came in range and sent it spinning back towards Yaxley. Spell deflection was something Harry had only pulled off a couple of times in practice with Cassie. It had been a risk to try it, but he knew it would lead to his victory if it worked, which was all that mattered.

Cadmus tried to dive out of the way of the spell, but Harry's Knockback Jinx caught him in mid-flight and sent him sailing through the air like a lost child's kite. His head slammed into the back of one of the couches near the fire and sent it toppling over on top of Yaxley, who struggled dazedly to get to his feet.

Harry's eyes were not fixed on the boy, but on the images etched so vividly into the sofa's leather. He squinted his eyes and tilted his head from side to side and suddenly, it was like every last depiction was moving.

**"Attack!"**

The couch came alive in a violent blur of motion as a sudden, unified hiss tore through what had been silence a moment before, yet it was drowned out by other noises that had replaced the quiet at the same time.

Screaming... half the room was screaming.

There were mutters, too, and jaws dropped so far they looked to be in danger of dislocating, but Harry paid no mind to any of them, though he heard and saw them all.

He advanced on Cadmus with his wand in hand. His expression was as blank as the common room's stone walls and it did not waver when several of the animated serpents coiled around the boy as others sank teeth into his arms, back, and shoulders.

"Enough!"

It was only because of months of conditioning and listening to that voice that Harry turned to face Cassie. Her cry alone had managed to reach him, though the haze had not yet cleared. Worry flickered at the corner of the haze for a moment. Had he gone too far? Had he ruined one of the only friendships he had left? The word *freak* seemed to hiss inside his head as he remembered the way Dudley told him he would never have a friend, but all those thoughts died when he met Cassie's eyes.

She did not look angry, just steadfast. "That's enough," she repeated. "He's had enough... you've made your point. Let it end."

Harry glanced from Cadmus, to Cassie, and back again. "I'm doing this for her," he said in a voice just loud enough for the boy to hear. **"Rest."** The snakes seemed to melt back into the couch all at once and become nothing more than depictions. Harry had crossed the room by the time the transformation had been made.

The room behind him was so quiet as he left it that every one of his footsteps echoed ominously against the floor as he went. No one moved to touch him, nor to check on his fallen victim. Harry found this odd for a moment before he realized why. As far as they all were concerned, no one dared attack the Heir of Slytherin.

**Chapter 1: Dangerous Secrets**

***July 8, 1899***

***Godric's Hollow***

***3:14 PM***

Godric's Hollow was a quaint little place that reminded Gellert of Kirchdorf. A squat town square made up the village's centre, surrounded by dense thickets of trees. Muggles dwelled here just like back home. Gellert's lip curled. *Their taint is everywhere.*

Britain was just as bad as Germany. Gellert had arrived here just last night and asked his aunt whether or not Godric's Hollow was made up only of witches and wizards. She had laughed and told him that the nearest purely wizarding settlement was miles away in a place called Hogsmeade. *Disgusting.*

This was the first time Gellert had been so close to muggles in years. How he craved to draw his wand and dole out justice. He could use one of them. The experiment that had him thrown from Durmstrang need not have been wasted. It would be merciful --- better that than to live without magic.

Gellert turned off the cobblestone walkway and up to the front door of a small home surrounded by a high fence whose wood was peeling. It looked a sorry sight, but he could feel the magic saturating every inch. *These people have sense keeping the muggles away. Aunt Bathilda keeps decent company.*

Gellert knocked thrice upon the door, then waited. No sound came but it soon opened, revealing a thin boy who brushed auburn hair away from piercing blue eyes. *There's a sharpness in his stare*.

"Good afternoon."

"Good afternoon. You are Albus Dumbledore?"

"I am, yes. Who might you be?"

"My name is Gellert Grindelwald. I believe you know my Aunt Bathilda?"

"I do. She's been a good friend of the family. Has she sent you?"

"She offers your family invitations to join us tonight." Keeping his voice level became difficult. "She believes the two of us will get on well."

The first thing his aunt said upon his arrival was how much he reminded her of this Albus Dumbledore. No one had ever been like Gellert. Why his aunt thought differently now, he knew not.

Dumbledore's face twitched. He looked bitter, but only for a heartbeat.

"Is something the matter?"

"There are just things that might make attending more difficult than it ought to be."

*This boy's not like me at all. Nothing would stop me from doing as I wanted.* The longer he watched, the more he thought he was missing something. Dumbledore looked wary. *Does he know of me? Has my reputation spread, or is my aunt a blabbermouth?*

Gellert looked up and met those eyes again. A small girl wept beneath a canopy of bright green leaves. The leaves began changing --- green, then orange, then brown --- and tumbled from the trees, dead by the time they reached the ground.

Sharp pain stabbed behind his eyes. He caught it and twisted, reaching out for another strand of memory. His psychic fingers were brushed aside. *An occlumens.*

Those blue eyes widened, but then Dumbledore's expression smoothed. "Tell your aunt that I, at least, will attend. My sister is sick and I'm unsure whether she or my brother will make it."

Gellert bowed his head. *He is more than I expected.* "Good day to you, Dumbledore."

"Grindelwald," Gellert tilted his head to the side. "I expect you won't treat my family so invasively if and when you meet them."

A thin smile crested his lips. "I would never dream of it."

"I'm surprised you waited as long as you did to start showing me memories again," said Harry, peering around the tower cell.

"I am generous to those who deserve my courtesy."

"So you knew Dumbledore before the duel?"

"I knew him better than anyone alive except perhaps his own brother."

"What was he like?"

"Albus?"

"No, Aberforth. He taught Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts last year."

Grindelwald tilted his head. "And you were not fond of him?"

"I don't know."

"How is this?"

"It's a long story. He just picked a rough way to go about things."

Grindelwald's lips twitched. "That sounds characteristic."

"I never knew he had a sister."

"I am unsurprised. Albus always liked his secrets. That one was guarded closely." Grindelwald peered out from between the bars covering his window, then looked back at him. "Do you have any more questions?"

Harry chewed his words, trying to choose the right ones. "When you walked up to the door, I could feel magic; it was all over the house."

"It pleases me that you noticed. What did it feel like?"

It suddenly struck Harry how mad this all was. The way they talked, it was like nothing had ever been wrong. *Get over it; if he wanted to kill you, you'd be dead. Think how much you'll learn.* "It felt... thick, maybe heavy. I don't know how to explain it."

"Oppressive."

"Yeah, that." There was a pause. "So what was that all about?"

Grindelwald interlaced his fingers. "There was a collection of wards. I had mastered the ability to sense magic --- you experienced that in the memory."

"Sense magic?" Harry remembered feeling waves of something rolling off the Mirror of Erised. *Was I doing it then without realizing? Like how I made things happen before Hogwarts?*

"The craft is invaluable but immensely complex. You will master it in time."

Harry perked up. "Will I?"

"You will."

"How?"

Grindelwald smirked. "I intend to help you master many things now that we are on such open terms."

***July 11, 1993***

***The Burrow***

***9:12 AM***

Ron nearly slammed his head against the kitchen table, his mother's scream echoing inside his skull. He grimaced, shutting his eyes against the noise. *One of these days, she'll break a window.*

Something did break. Percy flinched, slamming his hand against a cup and sending it tumbling to the floor. Ron's elder brother flushed. He would be able to fix things like that with magic in just over a month, but not quite yet.

"Arthur!" Molly shouted. His father was moving towards the door to leave for work. "Arthur, come back! We won!"

Ron heard his father's footsteps halt. "Won?"

"Yes, Arthur! Won! The galleon draw! We won!"

Ron suddenly realized that his mother was crying. He exchanged uncomfortable looks with the twins as the sound of their father's footsteps returned. *Galleon draw?*

"Did we really?" he asked once back, moving behind his wife's chair and reading that morning's *Daily Prophet* over her shoulder. "Merlin, we really won."

Ron watched as his mother leapt up and hugged his father, sobbing into his chest.

*This is nice and all, but do they have to do it here?* A grin spread across his face regardless.

Smiling felt odd. That expression had been so scarce since leaving the Chamber of Secrets that Ron had almost forgotten what it felt like.

The only times he had smiled were when Cedric was over, much like last summer. *If only he knew what really happened.*

Thinking about that just made him remember blonde hair pooled around an innocent face, crimson fingers reaching from her chest, spreading across the dark stone floor.

His nightmares made those memories worse. Ron wasn't alone in his suffering, though regret tugged so hard at him that he felt it in his stomach. Luna had been one of Ginny's oldest friends. Never had they been thick as thieves, but he still heard her sobbing from her bedroom the first few nights and knew how it felt to lose a friend. He ought to have gone to her, but what would he say? *I can't even figure myself out; it's not like I could help her.*

*Idiot! Snap out of it! First good thing that happens all summer and you're ruining it.* "What are we going to do with it?" his mother was asking.

"We need to save," his father said, scratching his balding head. "Merlin knows we can't let ourselves get so low on gold again."

His mother tutted. "Yes, but it's seven hundred galleons! We can save half and still do something special."

"Let's think about it; there's no need to do anything rash." His father looked out the kitchen window while he straightened his robes. "I really must be off."

"Yes, yes, get to the ministry."

Something special? *Weird. Mum's always nervous about spending money.* Then he looked across the table and saw the shadows beneath Ginny's eyes. The pain in his stomach returned, tenfold now. *It's because of everything that's happened... Merlin, why is everything my fault?*

***July 17, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***8:53 AM***

Harry was fond of the dining hall at Black Manor. Probably because it was the opposite of the one he'd grown up with on Privet Drive. Vernon and Petunia\'s was bright, flanked by white walls. The one at Black Manor was set before towering windows made from black stained glass dimming any light that entered.

Harry sat waiting at the table, lit by a handful of floating candles. The loud crack accompanying Kreacher's appearance no longer startled him. "Can Kreacher be making Master Harry breakfast?"

Harry smiled, still bemused. *Merlin*, he thought, *we've come a long way in a month.*

***Earlier...***

The train slowed, King's Cross Station looming up ahead. *No kidnappings this time; I'll take that as a win.* The entire journey felt like a dream. Tension still remained between Harry and Draco, but being able to talk with Pansy and Theodore made up for that. *I can't believe how natural it feels after so much time.*

The platform was full to bursting. They all filed behind Crabbe and Goyle, who forced a path through the crowd of bodies.

Draco went to his father the moment they found him, but Theodore placed a hand on Harry's arm. "I might not see you for a while."

Harry raised an eyebrow. "Why not? Are you and your father travelling again?"

Theodore's face was unreadable. "No, I don't think so. Father just wants my help with some things."

Images flashed behind his eyes. Tiberius Nott sitting at a long table, curtains drawn across the window behind him. The world bathed in billowing steam, blissful air tickling chalk-white skin.

A shiver ran up Harry's spine. *What was that last one?* "Hopefully he doesn't keep you busy all summer," said Harry, feigning a smile.

"I'm sure I'll slip away for your birthday." Theodore held out his hand and Harry took it, shaking firmly. "Take care, Harry."

"You too, Theodore, have a nice summer."

Not until Theodore and the Malfoys left did Harry remove a raven-shaped pendant from his pocket. "Toujours Pur."

Something tugged behind his naval. His heart raced, breath caught in his chest as the world blurred around him. *Get a grip! This one was planned; you're not being kidnapped!*

Harry's feet slammed against a well-polished floor. *This must be the entrance hall.* Obsidian pillars flanked towering windows obscured by dark curtains. A mosaic sprawled across the floor; a field of blooming roses beneath a star-filled sky. Plinths were interspersed around the hall's edge, each topped with a raven carved from stone.

*CRACK!*

The oldest elf he'd ever seen appeared. Wispy white hair sprouted from its ears, its teeth past rotting and its grey skin hung in places.

"Kreacher's new master is here, and what a master he is, tainted by muggle filth. They say he lived with them. What would my mistress say?"

"Something foul if she was sensible." The elf looked up, wide-eyed. Harry almost laughed. "Did you expect me to defend them?"

Kreacher's ears perked. "Master doesn't seem tainted to Kreacher."

Harry scowled. "You can't live with muggles and not be tainted."

Kreacher frowned. "Kreacher is confused by his new master."

***Back in the present...***

"Yes, please. I'll take some eggs with bacon and toast."

Kreacher bowed so low his nose scraped against the floor, then he was gone with another loud *CRACK.*

"I don't know how you've won him over so quickly," said Regulus, sipping at his tea.

Harry shrugged. "It wasn't that hard. I just acted like a pureblood and let him know I hated muggles."

"That does go a long way in this family, yes."

"Your mother's portrait probably didn't hurt."

"No, I imagine not." Regulus chuckled. "My dear old mother would die another death if she realized she was teaching a halfblood."

Regulus said his mother had gone insane, but her portrait here was done long before that happened. Harry could see the seeds of madness, but she was relatively sane. There had only been a few outbursts whilst she taught him the finer points of wizarding etiquette, and none about him. The moment Regulus introduced him as a pureblood heir and the best friend of Narcissa Black's son, all had gone smoothly.

Regulus had still been concerned, warning him before that first meeting. *"So long as you don't bring up muggles, muggleborns, Grindelwald, the Dark Lord, or my brother, you should be fine."*

*"Is that all?"*

*"Probably not, but those are the important ones. Best not mention that you're a halfblood, but we've covered that already."*

"What are you reading?" Harry asked as he took the chair nearest Regulus, who held something too thick to be that morning's paper.

"I ordered you a copy --- here." The Black Lord withdrew his wand and gave it a flick, summoning a rectangular box. Harry frowned and opened it.

His breath caught. An auburn-haired teenager stared out at him from the cover with familiar blue eyes, arm in arm with a blond-haired youth who could only be Grindelwald.

Harry removed the book, turning it to read the back cover.

*Stripping away the serene facade of silver-haired wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals all. A disturbed childhood and lawless youth, lifelong feuds forming from a suspicious demise, guilty secrets leading to the death of millions --- all of this and more is uncovered in the riveting* Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore*.*

***July 18, 1993***

***The Headmaster's Office***

***9:00 PM***

A strong summer wind blew outside, rattling panes of glass. Fawkes lifted his head and peered at Severus, then out the large window. The sky was a deep shade of purple and the light was fading fast.

A clock chimed and Dumbledore looked up from a heaping stack of papers. "I apologize for my tardiness. Thank you for coming, Severus."

Severus inclined his head. "I am here to serve, Headmaster."

"A fact for which I will always be grateful." *His smile is too strained. His news is dire.*

Severus curled his lip. "I presume you have not brought me here to offer the position I have long thirsted for?"

Dumbledore smiled a sad smile. "I'm afraid not. You are much too valuable; I would not leave you to the mercy of Lord Voldemort's curse."

Severus suppressed a shudder at the Dark Lord's name. *He says it with no regard for those around him.* "What of your brother? He is safe and whole; I see no obvious signs of a curse."

Dumbledore opened a desk drawer and removed a thick book, his own face smiling up from the front cover. "Have you paid Miss Skeeter's work much mind?"

"I have read some. My faith in her writing is low."

Dumbledore sighed. "She has done well this time around. I fear how she learned these pages' secrets, but many are true."

Severus studied him. "You fear how she learned them?"

"She writes about things only three living people know of. I told her nothing, nor did Aberforth."

"Who is the third?"

"Bathilda Bagshot. A delightful woman who is well past her age and vulnerable to the whims of youth."

His lip curled again, bile rising in the back of his throat. "Have you not reported her?"

"Not while Lucius Malfoy holds such a tight grip on much of the ministry. Reports may be seen as flustered defences. That is the last thing I need after the school's recent fiasco."

"What does any of this have to do with your brother and the curse?"

Dumbledore put the book down on his desk. "This book taints Aberforth as well as I. He knew it would when it was announced and resigned. Had he stayed, the parents and governors would have forced his hand."

Severus narrowed his eyes. "Does it not slander you more fiercely?"

"It does."

"And you intend to remain at Hogwarts?"

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "I have advantages Aberforth does not and am not so easily replaced, if you will pardon my arrogance."

*The two greatest wizards I have ever known and the difference between each is so stark.* "If you wish to blame the curse for Skeeter's writings, then very well. What is it you summoned me for?"

"I wished to ask if there were any signs pointing to Lord Voldemort's return?"

Severus crushed a flash of shock and kept his face schooled. "Signs?" Something nagged at him, but it slipped through his fingers each time he reached for it. *Strange.*

"Yes. I think it is suspicious his evil has touched Hogwarts two years in a row. That is saying nothing about Tiberius Nott's newest accessory."

Severus paused. "Newest... accessory?"

"Tiberius wears a glove any time I have seen him in public. It is a queer choice that I consider suspicious."

*Why must the world's greatest wizard be so utterly mad?* "I fail to see a connection between the Dark Lord and a glove."

Dumbledore's smile returned, bitter this time. "Do you? Answer me something, Severus. If you were to concoct a ritual that might return Voldemort to his powers, how would you do it?"

*Ah... ominous.* "There would be blood," he admitted.

"Sacrifice, yes, one of the few things powerful enough to achieve what he seeks. I suspect many might be surprised if they looked beneath that glove."

His pulse quickened. *Bloody hell.* "So you think the Dark Lord has returned?"

"I am unsure. The ritual could simply have returned him to a rudimentary form. When I faced him in that corridor more than a year ago, he was scarcely a shadow."

Severus cleared his mind; he had bargained for none of this. "I have heard nothing. None of the old guard trust me completely. People like Lucius remain amiable, but many consider me a traitor."

"Yes," said Dumbledore, scratching at his beard. "I had hoped for other signs, though I don't know what they would be." That nagging returned, but Severus ignored it. *My mind is playing tricks, how strange.* "Do keep your eyes peeled and watch out for Harry."

Rage built inside him. *How am I to watch a boy who cares nothing for himself?* He sneered. "I hope only that Potter has heeded my warnings."

Dumbledore shoved the book back into the drawer it came from. "Is that what you call them, Severus? I have heard you were most unpleasant this past year."

"If the boy would read between the lines, he would know that I am advising caution and responsibility. It is all good so long as Lily's magic protects him, but there are others to consider. I hoped that pairing him with the Crabbe dolt would prompt greater consideration for those around him."

Dumbledore's lips curved down. "You have strange ways of making your point. Regardless, watch him for me?"

Severus stood, bowing before he left the room. "Always."

**Book 3: The Looming of Shadows**

**Chapter 2: Black Tidings**

***July 24, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***4:13 PM***

Heavy black curtains were pulled shut over towering windows, plunging the Black family library into darkness except for the candles and torches burning throughout the room. The shelves reached up so high that some of them were lost in shadow. They reminded Harry of the tunnel leading to the Chamber of Secrets. *This place is probably about as dangerous.*

Regulus had warned him about the Black family library the first night of summer. *"It might be the country's largest collection of books on twisted magic."*

Most of his time here hadn't been spent reading any of the Blacks' books, but *The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.*

The book had divided public opinion. Rita Skeeter had droves of devoted readers who took everything she said as gospel. They were a raging mob, shouting for Dumbledore to relinquish his positions of power.

*"Do you think they'll get their way?"* Harry had asked Regulus over dinner.

Regulus just shook his head. *"Not a chance. Dumbledore has too much power and support. It would take something catastrophic for him to lose his positions unless the ministry or Wizengamot actively pushed for it."*

*"And neither of them are?"* Regulus shook his head again, chewing his steak. *"I would have thought people like Lord Malfoy would take the chance to try weakening Dumbledore's base of power."*

*"You're learning, but slowly."*

*"What do you mean?"*

*"Plenty of idiots believe everything Skeeter says, but plenty more have functional minds and think for themselves. Skeeter has spouted off too much nonsense over the years for people to believe all this. It's a start. If something else happens, Dumbledore would have a hard time fending off the masses. He might still give up a position for the sake of public appearances, but no more than that. People like Lucius will be hoping for something bigger to happen while Dumbledore is more vulnerable than he's ever been. That's when they'll pounce. Not over a book full of rumours."*

*If only people realized most of the rumours might actually be true.* Dumbledore really had been friends with Grindelwald. How far that had gone, he did not yet know, but there had been something there.

***July 20, 1899***

***The Dumbledore Family Home***

***6:22 PM***

"Believing any trail to them remains here is foolish."

Days had been spent together since that first dinner. The two of them had bonded from the moment his aunt mentioned the Deathly Hallows. Gellert's obsession had reignited with another believer onside, and they had talked of little else since.

Now they sat in Albus's living room and rehashed the old debate. It never ceased to frustrate Gellert. *Never have I met anyone so controlled by their own closed-mindedness.* A fire swirled inside his chest, purpose unlike anything he had ever known. *I must break these barriers --- for him and the world.*

"Why are you so insistent on this?" he asked. "This is the resting place of the most successful Peverell. Surely you do not mean to tell me you believe the tale's fancies about Death after all this time?"

"I've found the same sources and drawn the same conclusions you have about the Peverells."

"Then why would this not be the beginning? Ignotus once called this place home. The others might have for all we know. There must be traces."

"I have told you already that I've known of the Hallows for longer than you. I heard the story years ago."

"As did I."

"But I didn't wait. Patience has never been a virtue of mine. I searched everywhere I could. You don't think I've scoured Ignotus Peverell's grave? You don't think I've searched every corner of this infernal place?"

Gellert smirked. "Perhaps I just think I'm more gifted than you are and believe that I can do something that you could not."

"Then you're more arrogant than I took you for."

"What one man calls arrogance, another calls confidence. It has always served me well; I see my paths and speak them into being."

Albus's lips thinned. "I have never been fond of Divination."

"Why not? There are records that prove its power."

"A small number of records over thousands of years. My point isn't that Divination doesn't exist. My point is that so few have the gift that the subject is all but obsolete."

Gallery smirked again. "How shortsighted of you."

"I prefer to call it pragmatic."

Gellert laughed, a cold and wild sound that poured from his lips. *I never realized how rarely I laughed; the sound has changed since I was a boy.*

"Do you, Albus?"

Gellert's head snapped around. The voice came from the sitting room's entrance.

Standing at the threshold was a boy who looked remarkably like Albus; he had the same long face, auburn hair, and the same piercing blue eyes, but he was shorter and not quite so thin. A girl hung from his arm. Gellert thought for a moment that she was a partner, but then he looked closer and remembered her sitting beneath a canopy of dying leaves.

"Your siblings?"

"Yes. Aberforth, Ariana, this is Gellert Grindelwald. He is Bathilda's nephew and has become a dear friend of mine."

"That explains a lot," snarled Aberforth, scowling. "I've never seen you so neglectful."

The air grew frosty. *Neglectful? What nonsense is he speaking?*

"Aberforth, there is a time and a place---"

"That time is now. Look at her!" He turned the girl towards her older brother. *Frail is not the half of it; Albus understated.*

"Ariana, what's wrong?"

The girl trembled, tears welling in her eyes. Gellert watched as his friend deflated. *There is more here than I realized.*

*"Tell your aunt that I, at least, will attend. My sister is sick and I'm unsure whether she or my brother will make it."*

Gellert's pulse quickened, anger boiling beneath his skin. *Another wizard made a slave to lesser beings. When does it end?* Albus agreed about the muggles. Those talks always made him uneasy, but he agreed. *Why let them control him? He must know there's nothing he can do for her.*

Gellert formed tendrils of magic and reached out towards her. The gesture was small and subtle; just enough to brush her mind.

Flaming daggers descended inside his skull. A short breath escaped him and his hand drifted towards his wand. Albus must have noticed; he would attack at any moment.

Nothing came. The girl was looking at him with wide, fearful eyes. The boy beside her still stared at Albus. *Impossible; she's a child.* There was no other explanation. *A natural occlumens? How can she possess such skills but be so broken?*

"I'll leave." There was nothing to be done. Albus would see reason in his own time; he had to. "It was a pleasure meeting you both." He smiled at the youngest Dumbledore. "I hope your health improves, Ariana."

"You don't need to leave," said Albus. Gellert almost grinned at the look on his face. *Yes, he will learn soon; he resents it already.*

His stomach twisted. Thinking of Albus like he did others always made him feel sick. He was better than them --- the only person who ever made Gellert feel whole. *It will be better for him; you act for the greater good.*

"It's all right. I'm sure we'll talk soon."

"I'll owl you this evening; our discussion is unfinished."

Gellert threw a careless grin over his shoulder. "I look forward to your letter."

***Back in the present...***

*I'd ask him to speed the memories up if it wasn't letting him win.* Giving Grindelwald inches worried him. Giving him the chance to take a mile was almost unthinkable. But Merlin, he was curious. *How did they go from being so close, to the greatest duel of all time?*

Skeeter wrote about Grindelwald fleeing after Ariana's death, but he hoped that was untrue. If Grindelwald had been the one to kill her... that did odd things to his mind when he considered how similar they were, often surfacing another memory.

*"We're similar, you know. Both halfbloods, both orphans raised by muggles unfit to lick the hems of our robes. We were both sorted into Slytherin House and quickly became prodigies in our own right. We're probably the only two Parselmouths who have come through this school since the great Salazar Slytherin himself and we even look somewhat alike."*

*Shut up, Riddle! I'm nothing like you! I'm better --- I'll prove it!*

***Meanwhile, in Cairo, Egypt...***

"I dunno how you put up with it," Ron told Bill as the two of them trudged through a sea of sand that smouldered under a blistering sun. "That portkey was awful."

"International ones are never pleasant, but getting paid to take them helps."

"Guess it would, yeah," Ron grunted, wiping sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand.

Bill had greeted them an hour ago, waiting at their point of arrival. Having spent the past handful of years working here, he knew the land well and had taken time off work, sans a few low-risk expeditions he said would take little time.

Bill had been staring a hole right through him from the moment they'd arrived. *The hell did mum tell him?*

"Is it always this hot?" Ron asked.

Bill pushed sweat-soaked hair back from his eyes. "You lot chose the hottest time of the year to pay me a visit, but it's never exactly like back home."

"Somewhere in between would be nice."

"Funny how things usually don't end up that way. How have you enjoyed Hogwarts?"

That was a trap question if he'd ever heard one. *Blimey, Bill's the one I always got on well with.* "Snape's as big a git as any of you said, and Quidditch is great."

Bill snorted. "Youngest seeker in a century they've taken to calling you?"

Ron blushed. "They did in first year. The nickname died a bit when I lost to Potter."

"I heard about that too. Something about a cursed bludger?"

"It wouldn't leave him alone. Chased him no matter what he did. Fred and George have never let me live that down; the fact I lost to someone who was busy flying away from a bludger the whole game."

"Not your finest moment, no." Bill came to a stop and withdrew his wand, conjuring a blanket and taking a seat, gesturing for Ron to do the same. "We've been walking for almost an hour. It's best to rest in this heat."

"I'm fine," Ron defended, wiping more sweat from his face.

Bill gave him a hard look. "Poor choice of words."

"What---"

"You're a lot of things, but I doubt fine is one of them. Not after how your last two years at Hogwarts ended."

Ron's cheeks burned. "Have Mum and Dad---"

"No one's put me up to anything. If you must know, they did write to tell me what happened, but nothing more than that." He gave Ron a pointed look. "I first saw a friend die during an expedition *after* I graduated."

Ron sobered. "Sorry," he muttered. "I never knew that happened."

"Every cursebreaker sees it. We got too close to a violent ward; he was the closest." Bill removed two flasks of water from his bag, handing one to Ron and taking a deep pull from the other. "That day popped up in my dreams for months, and I wasn't eleven."

Ron hunched his shoulders. "That was more than a year ago. It was really hard, but I've had time."

Ron shifted beneath his brother's gaze. *Did I mess up?* "I was under the impression that Neville Longbottom fell down a flight of stairs."

Cold seeped through his veins despite the blazing sun. *I definitely messed up.* "What---"

"I said that I watched someone die and you implied you went through that same thing after his death."

"I didn't mean---"

"Didn't mean to tell me? No, I imagine not." Bill took another sip of water while Ron fussed with his robes, heart pounding against his ribs. "Since you've been bottling it up for a year, do you care to actually tell someone how Neville Longbottom died?"

"I didn't see it. Honest, I didn't."

"So you were proxy to it; it's close enough."

*Why does he have to be so bloody smart?* "I can't."

"Why not?" asked Bill, lying down on the blanket and peering up at Ron. "You know I'm not the type to run off and tell Mum or Dad."

Ron wrung his hands. "I promised Dumbledore I wouldn't say anything to anyone --- even my family."

"Did you now?" Bill asked with a frown. "Serious business, then. Is it at least safe to say what happened was no simple accident at school?"

Ron nodded. "It wasn't, no. I... wish it was."

Bill scowled. "Then you're a fool."

Ron's eyes widened. "What---"

"If it was no accident, then it meant something. Some stupid fall down a jinxed set of stairs is meaningless. It doesn't do the person justice. I don't know how Longbottom died, but your reactions tell me it had more purpose than that."

Ron swallowed a lump in his throat. "It... yeah, it did."

"There you go. What about Lovegood's?"

Ron blinked back hot tears. "I saw that one."

It was so close. Ron could feel the truth on his tongue. The moment was perfect, but something gave him pause. The last thing he wanted was for Bill to think him some sort of fool. *And that's if he doesn't think I'm a killer.*

"And that's the worst part for you?" He nodded. "There's no easy advice to help with this one. All I can say is that you'll work through it and that you should learn from it."

Ron swallowed hard again. "What do you mean learn from it?"

Bill shrugged. "It's hard to say without knowing more. I know that you were in the Chamber of Secrets with that supposed Heir of Slytherin. It must not have been a pleasant thing to see, but there was probably a lesson to be learned. Something that can be taken away from it that will make you better."

Another lump formed in Ron's throat. "I'll think about it," he rasped. "I just don't want to think about it all that much."

"Distractions are nice." Bill took his longest sip of water yet, but his eyes never left Ron. "Do you remember what you said when I first told the family I wanted to be a cursebreaker?" Ron shook his head. "You said that you were going to become one, too." Bill grinned. "If professional Quidditch didn't work out, of course."

Heat flooded his cheeks again. "It sounded cool."

"Does it still? Even after I've told you about colleagues stumbling to their deaths?"

"That doesn't make it any less cool. It just means it's more serious than I realized as a kid."

Bill chuckled. "You're still a kid whether you like it or not. You'll tell me I was right in two years, then again in another two, then again two years after that."

"Yeah, yeah, whatever. So, what were you saying about cursebreaking?"

"The sites I'll be off to whilst you lot are here have already been examined. It's simple work. Go in, take down some wards, and remove whatever they're protecting."

"So?"

"If you wanted the distraction and any of those expeditions landed on days the family wasn't doing anything interesting, I was going to offer to take you along."

Ron's jaw fell open. *Merlin...* "You'd take me?"

"So long as you promised to listen at all times and stay back until told otherwise."

His heart sank. "Mum would never---"

"I'm sure I can talk her around."

"Are you?"

"I am. You need it and she knows that."

The two boys sat in silence for a long time. "Thanks, Bill. I need all this."

***July 25, 1993***

***Malfoy Manor***

***1:07 PM***

It felt strange being back at Malfoy Manor. Nearly a month of summer had passed, but finally Harry's friends were all freed up from whatever had been keeping them busy.

Harry was the first to step from the fireplace and was fawned over by Narcissa until Pansy's arrival not long later. The dark-haired girl was practically vibrating with excitement as she chattered away at a hundred words per minute.

Crabbe and Goyle arrived just seconds apart, but the arranged meeting time came and went before Theodore finally stepped from the fire.

*He looks different.* His skin was a touch too pale. His eyes too looked wrong, too blank and guarded.

"Summer taking a lot out of you?" Harry asked, quietly enough so only Theodore would hear whilst they all walked outside.

"Just tired is all." Theodore fidgeted. *He doesn't look tired to me...*

"Quidditch?" Draco asked Harry, Crabbe, and Goyle. *Guess he figures the others won't be interested.*

Harry shot one last glance back at Theodore before agreeing. Theodore must not have expected it because his expression slipped. *Something really is wrong,* Harry thought as he mounted his Nimbus. *I've never seen him look so worried.*

***July 28, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***9:04 AM***

Theodore's expression plagued him those next few days --- mixed with his worries about Grindelwald and half a dozen other things. A string of beautiful days all dawned, bright and vibrant, but none of them washed his worries away.

Those worries were strong this morning, so Harry made his way down to the sitting room to eat breakfast with Regulus, who usually said something interesting to take his mind off things.

This morning, that thing was Quidditch. "I just don't really know anything about professional Quidditch," Harry admitted.

Regulus sipped his tea. "You enjoy the game, though?"

"Yeah."

"You'd love watching professional Quidditch."

"Probably. I've just never had the chance. I don't even know all the teams."

Regulus smirked. "You hardly need to know all the teams. Teams like the Chudley Cannons haven't been relevant in a century."

"Aren't Chudley the orange ones?"

"That's them." Regulus grinned. "See? You know more than you realize."

Harry shrugged. "Not really. Draco just mocked Ron Weasley loads for supporting them."

"Probably one of his better reasons for mocking someone." A shadow passed across Regulus's face. "Your father and his group of friends sometimes went around the halls loudly supporting Chudley for the sake of being contrarians." Regulus shook his head. "That and starting fights."

Harry laughed as Kreacher popped into the room with that morning's mail. Harry's laughter ceased the moment Regulus glanced down towards the *Prophet's* front page.

It was like all the blood vanished from his body for how quickly he paled. His hands trembled so badly he was forced to set down his cup of tea.

*That's not good.* "Regulus, what---"

"I'm sorry, Harry. I'll be in my study. Call for Kreacher if you need anything."

Never had Regulus dismissed him so soundly. It stung worse than expected, but he ignored it and reached for the paper while Regulus rushed off. *What the hell could make him react like that?*

A handsome face stared out at him with eyes so much like his brother's. Long black hair tumbled past his shoulders, grinning like he knew some secret no one else did.

***July 28, 1993***

***Malfoy Manor***

***8:44 PM***

It had been a strange day. Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban had rocked the nation and Regulus remained shut up in his study.

Harry knew who Sirius Black was but found himself feeling disconnected. He had never grown up fearing his name and could not make himself hate a man for killing a dozen muggles. *Maybe I am like Voldemort.*

*No!* he told himself. *There's nothing wrong with hating muggles; you're no Voldemort, you'll be better.*

The day grew stranger when an owl from Narcissa arrived that afternoon. Harry frowned as he read, something felt off. She wanted to meet with him that night. *Why does she sound so worried? It's like she's afraid something big will happen before we meet tonight.*

He was no less perplexed by the time he stepped through roaring green flames and into the Malfoys' opulent manor.

*CRACK!*

Harry's hand drifted towards his wand when he saw the familiar, filthy pillowcase, but he relaxed when he realized this was not Dobby.

"Master be here to see Mistress Narcissa?"

Harry nodded. "She told me to come and talk to her after I was done with everything for the day."

"I be taking you to her now."

They walked through a maze of winding halls that gave way to a large sitting room. Setting sunlight streamed through windows stretching from floor to ceiling, pooling around Narcissa as she paced back and forth. A nervous prick pierced Harry's confusion. *I've never seen her look nervous before.*

"I be bringing the young master to you, Mistress Narcissa."

Harry's nerves hardened when she spun a fraction too fast. *She's jumpy, too.* "I see that. Begone; ensure no one interrupts."

"Is everything all right?" Harry asked once the elf was gone.

"I wish I could tell you that it was."

*She sounds like she expects an explosion, or something.* "What's wrong? Does this have something to do with Sirius Black?"

It was like the fatigue of a long day caught up with her all at once. "Everything."

*Why is she so worried by Black? He's on the same side as her husband.* "What is it? I wouldn't have expected you to be so worried about him."

"It's not him I'm worried about, it's you."

Harry hesitated. *Me?* "How much of what we talked about in the hospital wing did Lord Malfoy tell you?"

"I am aware of the conversation. You know that Lucius faithfully serves the Dark Lord in whatever way he can."

Harry studied her. "He said that the Dark Lord doesn't want me to fear him."

"That's true as far as I know."

"Then why would I need to worry about Sirius Black? Everyone says he was the Dark Lord's lieutenant."

Narcissa twirled a lock of hair around her finger. "Everyone says plenty about situations they know nothing about." Her voice lowered.

"What is there to know? Black killed a wizard and a dozen muggles in broad daylight."

"So did most of the Dark Lord's followers. My own sister did worse before being sent to Azkaban."

"Your sister?"

"Bellatrix Lestrange."

"Oh, right. She was a Black."

Narcissa gazed back out the window. "She was."

"Wasn't she the one arrested for torturing the Longbottoms?" Harry had researched the Longbottoms after Neville's murder in his first year. The story had filled his nightmares until Grindelwald took them over.

"Along with her husband, his brother, and Barty Crouch's son, yes."

His pulse quickened. *She must be using Occlumency. No one looks that calm a few seconds after being so panicked. Merlin, what's going on?* "So what is it about Black that has you so worried if it isn't what he did?"

"Not to the muggles or to Peter Pettigrew." She lowered herself onto one of the couches, hands folded in her lap. "I think it's best if you sit." Harry sat with bated breath. Whatever made her speak so gently must not be good.

"I've told you that your father was part of an infamous group of delinquents whilst at Hogwarts."

Harry nodded slowly. "I remember."

"What I haven't told you was who his friends were."

Dread coiled in the pit of his stomach. "Black was a Gryffindor, wasn't he?" Narcissa nodded. "So Black was friends with my father?"

"Him and Peter Pettigrew, along with another boy named Remus Lupin." She appeared to chew her words. "The reason I didn't tell you is because Black's allegiances in the Purity War were more complicated than most would have you believe."

Harry tilted his head. *Complicated?* "They seem obvious."

"Black wasn't always loyal to the Dark Lord. He was driven from his parents' house as a teen and spent the next few years living with your father."

"So he joined Voldemort after school even though he was friends with my father?" There was something else. This was all new but meaningless. What did he care if his father once lived with a madman who may not yet have been mad?

"The first group Sirius joined was a vigilante organization run by Dumbledore. They were more effective in fighting the Dark Lord than the ministry for most of the war."

"What changed?" It was the only question left, but he dreaded the answer. What could have turned Black away from his best friend and into the open arms of Voldemort?

Narcissa wrung her hands. "No one knows. I'm sure the Dark Lord did before he attacked you, but it's not as though anyone has been able to ask him."

"So he just joined him?"

Narcissa's mask cracked. *Here we go...* "It wasn't that simple."

Harry scowled. *Get to the point.* "None of this seems to be simple."

"I know, but it's going to get worse."

"Just say it."

Narcissa closed her eyes. She looked like a porcelain statue as she pondered. "Have you ever heard of the Fidelius Charm?"

Harry opened his mouth to answer no, then remembered something Dumbledore had once told him.

*"It was much more complicated than that, but yes. It was first sent to Gringotts while I ensured certain protections were in place at the castle. Other things were considered, too. The Fidelius Charm was taken under strong consideration, but I dismissed it. Nicholas has participated in the charm's casting as many times as a person can and I confess, I wanted to save my available usages of it for a later date."*

"I've heard it mentioned. Something about available usages?"

"It's a very complicated spell. It involves two people --- the caster and the secret keeper. The caster casts the spell and it's bound to the secret keeper. Anything the spell is cast on will be hidden so completely that it's impossible to find."

Harry's suspicion rose. *That seems like it would have been a better protection for the stone.* "Why isn't that used all the time?"

"The available usages factor you mentioned plays a part."

"I don't actually know what it means. I just heard someone say it."

Narcissa toyed with her hair again. "It means that no one can be the caster or the secret keeper more than once."

"Wait, what?"

Narcissa shrugged. "The theory is beyond me. Very few witches or wizards have ever successfully cast it."

Harry hated that his first idea was to ask Grindelwald about the spell. He shivered. *Stay on-topic, this is more important right now.* "What about Black? What does this have to do with him?"

"Have you not guessed?" Harry shook his head. A pained look crossed Narcissa's face and unease slithered in his stomach. *This won't be good.* "Your parents went into hiding under the Fidelius Charm. Your mother was the caster and Sirius was the secret keeper."

Numb shock washed over him. It all made sense. Why Narcissa had been so worried, why she had wanted to be the one to tell him, and even why there was so little information about Sirius Black as a Death Eater. This meant...

Heat stirred beneath his skin. "So he betrayed my parents?"

"Yes."

Something was building in the pit of his stomach. Something hot and vile that threatened to burn straight through his flesh and spill out across the floor.

"Why?" was his only question.

"The only one who ever knew was the Dark Lord."

"This was why you wanted to tell me. Because you were afraid if I learned from someone else, I would think... something."

"I don't know what you're thinking now or what you would have thought, but this is a family matter. It should be handled with family, and it should be family who support you."

Harry ran a trembling hand through his hair. His Occlumency wavered. How he craved for the power to suppress his emotions.

"Is there anything else?"

"Are you all right?" Narcissa asked, moving closer.

*No! There's nothing worse than a traitor!* "I just... I need time to think."

"I think it's best if you're not alone."

"We can talk again, I just... is there anything else? I need to go."

"Harry---"

"Tell me!"

Narcissa pulled back. Guilt tried forming in his stomach --- he should never have yelled at her --- but the anger burned it to ash. It was winning, chipping at his defences brick by brick. Soon they would crumble and he would explode; he had to leave.

"Some people think that Black had personal reasons for betraying your father. It would explain why he went after Pettigrew and I've heard it said he would have killed you when he got to the house had Dumbledore's man not beaten him there."

Dumbledore's man had been Hagrid. Harry remembered the giant telling him how he had carried him across the sea the night his parents died.

Then it struck him what Narcissa was saying and he almost exploded right there. This was all too much. First Voldemort, then Grindelwald, and now this? It wasn't fair! None of this was fair! *When will everyone leave me alone?*

Tears stung the corners of his eyes. Every part of him trembled, rage seeping from every pore. "And now Black might come to try and finish the job, whether the Dark Lord wants him to or not."

"He will fail. We're here for you. Me, Lucius, Regulus, Diana, Draco, all of us. No one is going to hurt you --- no matter how hard they try." The tears were no longer silent. It was overwhelming.

He almost leapt from his skin when he felt her touch him. Harry leant back, but Narcissa was faster. She snaked her arms around his back and held him close. He stilled, shivering when cool fingers stroked his hair.

*It's too much.* The shaking worsened as weakness crept through him. His body collapsed and he buried his head in her shoulder, wracked by furious tears.

***July 30, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***The Library***

***2:33 PM***

It had been a long two days.

Harry had not returned home that night, instead sleeping at Malfoy Manor in the room he had occupied the previous summer.

The dreams had been awful.

Dreams of waking to that face looming over him, smiling the way it had in the *Daily Prophet's* photograph before everything vanished in a flash of green light.

Black had consumed his thoughts that next day; angry thoughts that boiled his blood and sent raging shivers up his spine.

*Why?* he'd thought. *I don't get this mad when thinking about Voldemort. Why does Black bother me so much worse?*

Both had played their parts in killing his parents, and both together had doomed him to a decade of hell on Privet Drive. The differences in how he felt about each of them confused him for a time, but it began making sense the longer he pondered.

Voldemort had acted to preserve himself. Harry's existence had been a threat to his own. *I can understand that.* What would he have done had he held the power to kill the Heir of Slytherin when his life was so threatened down in the Chamber of Secrets? *I can't blame him for being paranoid.*

Black's crimes felt more personal. *He betrayed them; he was their friend and he betrayed them.* The thought made him sick. How many times had Harry been betrayed? The Dursleys, Gemma, Draco, Daphne, the list went on and on. Each betrayal cut deep and left scars harsher than the ones carved by his parents' death. *I'll never forgive a traitor.*

Duelling lessons had resumed with Lord Corban Yaxley and he was improving fast. *Not fast enough --- I need to be ready when he comes for me.*

He looked around the library, considering the shadowed shelves with a frown. "*It might be the country's largest collection of books on twisted magic."*

*CRACK!*

Harry's head whipped up as violent fancies faded. "Kreacher?"

"There's a letter, master."

Harry leapt from his seat when he saw the bright orange envelope. Something so lurid could only have come from one man.

*Good day, Harry,*

*I'm afraid I've been quite inundated by letters these past few weeks, so I must apologize for the tardiness of my reply.*

*I will not claim my youth was savoury, nor even shout of blasphemy from the rooftops. Miss Skeeter's book is well-researched, just know that some things have been dressed up for public consumption.*

*Ariana's death was a tragic accident born at the end of a strife-filled summer. I wish Miss Skeeter would have let the dead rest --- there is no honour involving them in politics like this --- but there is certainly some truth in what she writes.*

*Thank you for your concern and I look forward to seeing you back at Hogwarts.*

*Kindest regards,*

*Albus Dumbledore*

*So it's true --- all of it is true.* Dumbledore meant to avoid the question, but he had given enough. *I can't blame him. It's not like he realizes I've already seen the start of that summer and can put the rest together.*

He closed his eyes but opened them the moment Sirius Black's face swam before his vision. *Damn him! I need a distraction!*

A tragic accident, Dumbledore had said? What sort of tragic accident could kill his sister and end a friendship he had once cherished? It was true, then --- it had to be; there was nothing else that explained everything so succinctly.

Grindelwald's pendant felt heavy against his skin, its metal cooler than usual. Or maybe that was just the cold that crept through him any time he considered leaning more on Grindelwald. If there were any doubts the memories were fakes, this disproved them, but giving the once dark lord an inch still unnerved him.

High, cold laughter filled his thoughts. His grip on the letter became vice-like as he closed his eyes. *Grindelwald might not have driven me mad, but thinking about Black for long enough will.*

"I did not expect you."

Harry opened his eyes and stared unblinkingly at Grindelwald. "I want another memory."

Grindelwald studied him. "Another memory?"

"Yes." He hesitated. "There's been a book published. It's about Dumbledore and it talks about what happened that summer."

"And you wish to know whether what it says is true?" Looking at Grindelwald suddenly became much harder, so Harry stared past him and out over the waters of Lake Königssee far below. "I must arrange flowers for the author if her work is what has piqued your interest."

Harry scowled. *Dumbledore is right; she should have left things alone.* "She's probably drowning in them already. Dumbledore has a lot of enemies and people are talking."

"I'm sure it means little to them compared to what it means to me. Their squabbles are petty, your interest might change the world. It is precious beyond anything they will ever own."

The room faded.

***August 4, 1899***

***The Dumbledore Family Home***

***3:21 PM***

Albus watched him for any sign of doubt as he so often did, but he would find none. "You truly mean to do everything you say? To unite the Hallows and then the world under a single banner."

Gellert trembled, excitement coursing through him. "Under the banner of those fit to rule. You have said it yourself. We are ruled by creatures who are made inferior."

"And you understand how difficult that will be?"

*Of course it will be difficult. There would be no need if it was easy.* "Of course it will be difficult, but you know my plans."

Albus gazed out the window. "You can't believe that old tale."

Gellert scoffed. "I think we've both made it clear that we believe the tale."

"But to believe possession of all three Hallows makes one---"

"The Master of Death? No, we both understand how foolish that is."

"Then what---"

*Why does he play these games? He understands this all himself.* "It is not about becoming the Master of Death. Think. Think what we could do with the Death Stick under our command, or with a stone powerful enough to raise armies of the dead."

"It would take decades if it was possible at all."

"Alone, perhaps."

"We've been over this before. You know I can't---"

"Then don't."

Albus blinked. "I beg your pardon?"

"You cannot leave your sister behind because she is too broken by what those muggles did to her." It had been days after first seeing Ariana when Albus explained the truth. All it did was make him surer that Albus would join him. *He must crave it just as deeply --- anything else is impossible.*

"You are correct."

"Then don't. Take her with you. She will be safer with us."

Albus laughed without mirth. "Safer whilst we oppose everything those with power believe in?"

Gellert sneered. "I scoff at their power. Political prestige will mean nothing when the systems that value it are torn to the ground. Magical prowess will mean nothing against us. We are better and you know it; the two most gifted sorcerers in the world. One of us will control the Death Stick whilst the other leads an army of the dead. No amount of might will save them then!"

A faraway look crossed Albus's face. "The cloak."

Gellert frowned. *What?* "What of it?"

"The cloak never fit into our plans."

"Why would it? It grants an ability we already have."

"An ability my sister lacks."

Gellert's chest swelled with glee. "Yes! That's it! See? You have no reason to turn down fate. We are destined to rule; everything fits so smoothly in place."

"Does it?"

Albus leapt from his chair. "Aberforth! What have I told you about entering uninvited?"

The foolish boy glared. "You want to lecture me, Albus? You talk of neglecting Ariana and you want to lecture me?"

"When did I ever---"

"Who would care for her whilst you two chased fame and glory? What would happen when she had an episode? Would the cloak hide her from her own disease?" Gellert clenched the arms of his chair so tight that his knuckles paled. *Fame and glory? Does the boy understand nothing? There would be no need to hide --- his sister would have justice!* "Admit it, Albus! You can't answer."

"There is no question to answer!" Gellert raged. "Think before you speak, boy. Think before you accuse---"

"Gellert, no!"

He glanced to his left and saw that Albus was tense and glaring. His stomach writhed. *How dare he choose that fool!* "Fine. I will leave you to quarrel with this lackwit yourself. Good day, Albus."

"Gellert! Wait!" Gellert had already left the kitchen and was most of the way to the door. He strode from the house without a backwards glance, pausing only when he saw her sitting cross-legged on the front lawn.

She looked up at him but shrank back from his glare, teary-eyed. *How is she so weak? How could such pathetic creatures break her so easily? They tested me and I grew stronger. She's gone through so much less and is frailer than a child.*

***July 31, 1993***

***Malfoy Manor***

***8:36 PM***

Grindelwald's memory had not provided the distraction Harry had hoped for. No longer did he obsess over Black and how he could work towards his destruction, but he was consumed by a new question. *Is it more dangerous to want Black dead, or to sympathize with Grindelwald?*

Harry walked the lawns of Black Manor the morning of his thirteenth birthday, hoping the fresh air and bright sunrise would lift his mood. It helped some, but he was aided more by Regulus, who was waiting for him in the dining room by the time he came back inside. The Lord Black had hidden away since his brother's escape from Azkaban, but today he was all smiles. *It's almost like it never happened.*

The day and its festivities did a better job still at taking his mind off things. A heaping breakfast greeted Harry and his friends at Malfoy Manor, followed by an afternoon out on the grounds playing Quidditch, chasing each other around the lake, and finally lounging near the water's edge.

The water had darkened and become split by a line of fading sunlight by the time they were summoned inside for dinner, joined now by the respective parents and their partners.

The feast left Harry full and sluggish, but presents stirred him just moments later. Books and trinkets dominated the haul, but all that changed when he opened the Malfoys' gift.

"The World Cup?" he asked, his heart fluttering.

"Britain is hosting next summer," Lucius explained. "These were devilishly hard to get ahold of, but I thought you might enjoy attending. I purchased tickets for us as well," he gestured to himself, his wife, and his children.

Harry grinned, glancing at Regulus, who looked a fraction too pleased. *I bet that talk about professional Quidditch was him gauging my interest for Lucius.*

The final gift was from Regulus and it was no chain this year; the box was much too large.

"Open it, then," said Regulus.

Draco gasped aloud when something red and gold rolled out. A second passed during which Harry wondered whether Regulus had pranked him with a Gryffindor-themed gift, but then he saw it.

"What is this?" he asked, running his fingers along the smooth, polished surface of a racing broom with red-coloured twigs. All he knew was the name, printed on the handle in golden letters.

"State-of-the-art racing broom," Regulus said with a grin. *I've never seen him look so happy*. "Some of the top World Cup teams will be using these next year. They're supposed to be miles ahead of any Nimbus and aren't technically in stock yet. Getting ahold of this one was a nightmare."

*Merlin...* "How much did this cost?"

Regulus waved a hand. "I was a seeker. No one is willing to spend more money on a broom than a seeker."

One awkward hug later, he found himself reacquainted with his friends' parents. *Thank Merlin for that portrait's lessons. They must have thought I was an idiot last summer.*

He finally extricated himself and slipped from the room, making for the nearest balcony. *I need some air.*

"Harry!"

Harry's hand drifted towards his wand. He might have jumped had he not recognized the voice. "Draco?"

"Something's wrong."

Harry's eyes narrowed. *I'm too stressed for this right now.* "What do you mean?"

The blond began fidgeting. "Father... he keeps looking at you. I don't know, it's just wrong."

*What is he on about?* "Looking at me?"

Draco wrung his hands. "Yes! It's like... I don't know. It just... I don't know. Something's not right."

Harry's heart fluttered. "What's his expression like? What makes it look wrong?"

"I don't know! He looks exhausted every time and my mother just left about ten minutes ago. They were whispering together when she stormed out. She didn't look pleased. Something's going to happen, but I don't know what."

Harry shifted from foot to foot, his hands on his wand. "What could happen? It's a birthday party."

"I don't know, just... Harry. I'm scared."

"I beg your pardon, masters." The squeaking voice made Draco jump and draw his wand, but it was only a house elf.

"What?" snapped Draco.

"It be Mistress Narcissa, sirs. She wants to see the young master." The elf bobbed its head at Harry. *It looks nervous, too.*

Harry looked from Draco to the elf. Could this be another betrayal? Had Lucius planned this whole thing with his son? *I don't think so. I believe him; he's never been good at hiding things.* Which meant that if Lucius and Narcissa had argued, this summons may be against Lucius's will. *I trust Narcissa more than him. She might be leading me away from whatever trap her husband set.*

"Where is she?" Harry asked.

"I be showing master if he follows me, sir."

Draco grabbed his arm once the elf moved away. "Be careful!"

Harry faked a smile. "Always."

Harry was led down the familiar path of corridors leading to the same room he had met Narcissa in earlier in the week. His nerves calmed some when they reached the room's entrance, but his head had begun aching.

"S-she be inside m-m-master." *What is it with the Malfoys' elves being so nervous about everything?*

Black curtains were drawn across the windows Narcissa had paced near the last time Harry was here. There were no torches or candles; the room was so dark that Harry could barely see the sofa. *This headache isn't helping anything. Merlin, it's getting bad.*

"Narcissa?" he asked as the pain swelled. He shook his head but no relief came, nor did it grow worse. Harry closed his eyes against the pain... the pain that came exclusively from his scar. Oh... *fuck!*

"I'm afraid she won't be joining us."

He clasped his hand over his scar as it exploded with pain. Suddenly he could see better and his head loomed higher, watching the boy shrink back. *Strange. Does my presence pain him?*

Harry forced his mind clear and the pain receded some. He removed a shaking hand and raised his eyes, staring across the room.

A pair of red eyes fractured the darkness, illuminating a chalk-white face that began moving closer...

**Chapter 4: Face to Face**

***July 31, 1993***

***Malfoy Manor***

***9:03 PM***

Harry drew his wand but knew it was hopeless. Days had been spent lamenting how he was not yet ready to face Sirius Black, and Voldemort was an entirely different monster.

The Dark Lord chuckled. "Do you mean to kill me, Harry?"

"You killed my parents." He was surprised how calm his voice sounded. "Why shouldn't I?"

"Such childish words, should and shouldn't. Who is to say what you should and shouldn't do? The Ministry of Magic, the most corrupt magical organisation in the country? Is that who you defer to in times like this?"

Harry took a deep breath. "You don't always need to be told---"

"You never need to be told. Not those of us with power. Should and shouldn't, right and wrong; they are cut from the same cloth of lies. Why *should* someone with power bend to the whims of those who are weak? Why *should* they not do what is best for them and instead do what they're told?"

The pain in his scar was still blinding. Harry clamped down harder on his emotions and the pain receded, still present but less violent. It was like he had unblocked a river; his mind was moving again. *Not that it's helping. How can I answer a question I've asked myself before?*

"Lucius Malfoy told me I have no reason to fear you."

"And what do you think?" Voldemort asked, his voice soft and quiet.

*I can hardly think at all.* "It doesn't make any sense."

Harry heard Voldemort move but could still see nothing. *Enough of this; if I'm going to die, it won't be in the dark.* He lit his wand, shocked and horrified by the sight before him. Scarlet eyes stared out from a chalk-white face, bald and noseless. *It's like he's half man, half snake.*

Voldemort spread his hands; skeletal things with long, pale fingers that were like spider legs made only from bone. "Do you see what you have accomplished, Harry?"

"A-accomplished?"

"I have conquered death, yet my defeat still haunts me. This body reminds me every day of what happened that night."

Every nerve screamed for him to run, but he held his ground. Fleeing would result in nothing but death; surely Voldemort would never take that chance. "So why are you talking instead of killing me?"

Voldemort spread his hands. "Magical blood is precious, every spilled drop is a tragedy."

Harry forced down the urge to scowl. "That's never stopped you before. Why should it now?"

"Is that what they've told you?" Voldemort's voice remained quiet but he might as well have shouted for how hard his words hit home. *It's like what Grindelwald said the first time we met. The* Dark Lord looked angry for the first time as he stood, waiting. "Answer me."

"I don't---"

"Is that how they label me? A tyrant who killed for sport and pleasure?"

*He wants the answer, and something tells me lying would be a bad idea.* "Sort of," he admitted.

"Explain," the Dark Lord demanded.

Harry forced himself not to muss his hair. "People's stories are different. No one seems to say the same thing, but most people think that. They say you wanted to kill anyone who wasn't a pureblood."

"Do they now?" Voldemort moved towards the window, pacing back and forth. Harry watched his every step and realized that Voldemort wasn't even looking at him. "Do you remember what I told you the night we met at Hogwarts?"

*How could I forget? That's the night that started everything, the night I started thinking for myself.* "You talked about muggles and how they fear what they don't understand. You mentioned that they were dangerous and that the Statute of Secrecy would fall. You've said it's come close before."

The words were like chalk on his tongue. They had kept him up for days back then, but he had ignored them. Now it was impossible. *How can I ignore them after what I've seen?* A broken girl lay in a pool of snow and blood, disfigured past recognition. Flames crawled up dry wood, licking at the hem of dark robes as a crowd of muggles cried for blood. *He's right --- everything he said about them was right.*

Bile rose in his throat. Why was the world so broken? Why did it make him agree with men like this? Harry wanted it all to go away. Voldemort, Grindelwald, all of it...

*Do you?* a small voice asked. *Do you really want them gone? Look what they're making you.*

"Muggles," hissed Voldemort. "The operative word is muggles. Where in what I told you did I mention the purity of blood?" Harry opened his mouth, but closed it. "Speak your mind," Voldemort commanded. "Now is the time to ask your questions. I will strike you down for none of them."

Wariness remained, but he decided to ask anyway. *Not that I have much choice.* *Sod it, Grindelwald surprised me, maybe he will, too.* "Tell me the truth, then?"

Voldemort ceased his pacing and turned his crimson stare on Harry. "The truth?"

"You seemed upset over what I'd heard about you and the war. Tell me the truth. What should I know? Convince me."

Voldemort's misshapen lips curved into something Harry thought was supposed to be a smile. "I have told you already what I want."

"Tell me more clearly." It was a mark of how far Harry's Occlumency had come that he was able to speak like this. *One wrong word might mean death.*

Voldemort considered him. "I wish to eliminate muggles and the threat they pose. That has always been my goal."

Harry's heart raced, but his voice stayed level. "What about your followers? Most of them were famous blood supremacists."

"What of them?" asked Voldemort.

*He sounds so casual.* "You say that you don't care about blood supremacy, but then you keep them around."

"Why should their opinions matter to me? All I care about is how well they serve. Those witches and wizards pledged themselves to me. I don't track every step they take because I have nothing to fear from them. If the job is done and done well, why should it matter if they go the extra mile?"

*This doesn't add up. Everything I've read says he's a tyrant. At least some people argue Grindelwald meant well.* "What about people like my father?" Harry asked, scrambling for anything to throw at Voldemort. "He was a pureblood and you killed him."

"I did." Voldemort's voice was calm and casual. *Should it bother me how easily he talks about killing them?* Harry had never known their faces back on Privet Drive. *Am I a monster because I don't cry for people I never knew?*

"Why?" he asked, unsure what else to ask.

"They opposed me. There was no malice, only purpose."

*I still think of Privet Drive anytime I look at him, but I can't hate that answer.* How could he hate someone for trying to survive? Harry wondered what he would have done in Voldemort's place, but thinking about it made his skin crawl. "So you only killed them because it helped your cause?"

"Yes."

"And you would do it again, wouldn't you?"

"Of course."

"Then why am I different?"

"Why would you not be?"

"I know about the prophecy." Voldemort's expression remained unchanged. "It said that a child born as the seventh month died would be the one to vanquish you. Dumbledore says you thought it was me, which is why you killed my parents and then attacked me."

Voldemort spread his hands. "And I was right, was I not? You were born as the seventh month died, and just as the prophecy foretold, you vanquished me. That is the end of it; the prophecy has been fulfilled and we are free of its bindings."

Harry's mind blanked. "We're... what?"

"Vanquished, not destroyed. My powers were shattered by magic I never considered. I was weaker than a ghost, scarcely a shadow drifting through distant lands. Does that not sound like I was vanquished? Did the prophecy not already come true?"

"Dumbledore made it sound---"

"Like there was more? Like it was your duty to throw yourself between him and I?" Harry said nothing. "Dumbledore has always been content letting others die. Grindelwald broke Europe while he sat comfortably in an office and marked my essays. I rose up years later and challenged everything he stood for, yet he never fought me. His servants died, but did he ever lift a finger?" Voldemort smiled again --- an image of cruelty that chilled Harry to the bone. "Why would Dumbledore fight now when he has the perfect pawn? One who has already taken a king off the board?"

*That's impossible, Dumbledore would never use me like that...*

*He did leave you with the Dursleys,* a dark voice whispered. *Even now he's admitted that he's not telling you everything. Why not? Does he not trust you, or does he not trust what you would do if he told you?*

*"The Malfoys might view you as a tool, but that doesn't mean all of us do."*

*I won't be used again, not unless I'm getting something out of it.*

"So you still want me to join you?" asked Harry. Thinking of that was easier than contemplating his own paranoia.

Voldemort smiled. "I want it more now than ever."

Harry forced himself to remain calm and ignore the blood rushing in his ears. "Why should I believe you? Why should I believe that it isn't just some plan to kill me?"

Amusement danced in Voldemort's eyes. "Think, Potter. We have been alone in this room with you at my mercy. If I wanted to kill you, you would be dead."

"My mother's sacrifice---"

"Is not all-powerful. There are always ways. I cannot touch you --- fine. I doubt that blessing would stop me from conjuring a storm of fire and burning you alive."

*Stop using logic that I can't just disprove.* "What about you manipulating me? How can I trust you're not doing that?"

Voldemort smiled. "That's better. I have no use for fools." He spread his skeletal arms again. "Ask anything of me and you will have it, so long as it doesn't weaken myself or my cause."

Harry's mind blanked. *He can't be serious.* He cleared his mind at top speed. "So you're bribing me to join you?"

"I am offering you a compromise and giving you a reason to take it. I'm not demanding your loyalty, I am asking for a chance to earn it." *That has to be a lie; Voldemort would never want to earn anything he could just take.* "We want the same things. You will see that soon."

*This sounds too good to be true.* "What if I refuse? What if I run back to Black Manor and write a letter to Dumbledore?"

"Then you die and waste the opportunity of a lifetime." His red eyes gleamed. "There are things I can give you that no one else can, not even Dumbledore."

Harry felt like his breath had frozen solid. Muscles ached each time he breathed. Could he do this? *There's no way he'll just let me take the offer and* *hang around forever. He'll demand my loyalty eventually. How long will he give me?*

He thought of his parents again and what they would think. He imagined their disappointed faces and expected to feel sadness. Instead he felt rage. *If they were worth anything, they'd want the best for me. But is this best? The risk is so high...*

A broken corpse lay in reddening snow, surrounded by discarded rocks and screaming mobs. Wood snapped beneath his feet as white-hot flames licked at the hems of his robes. The world faded, lost to the unimaginable pain of the Cruciatus Curse. A cupboard door slammed and darkness swallowed him, bitterness clawing at his chest.

That was when he decided. *The risk is worth it --- anything to never feel helpless again.*

***August 3, 1993***

***Egypt***

***1:48 PM***

Ron had expected it to be cooler underground, but it was just a different kind of heat. His skin no longer burned, but the air was so thick and stuffy that it was difficult to breathe.

"We're getting closer," said a tall man with dark skin and long black hair.

Bill had kept his word and convinced their mother to let Ron go with him on this job. Ron had half-expected that her mind would change, up until the moment he portkeyed away with Bill. *I still don't know how Bill convinced her.*

They had met up with the others and taken a flying carpet to their excavation site. Ron had never been on a flying carpet and remembered his father complaining that they were illegal back home. *Doesn't beat a broom, but I'd buy one if I could.* A sea of sand spread out beneath them, dotted with small towns and scarce mirages that were there for a heartbeat, then gone.

Bill had rolled up the carpet and shoved it into the bag slung over his shoulder when they'd landed. "Can't you just shrink it down?" Ron had asked.

"No," said Bill. "Altering its properties like that would disturb the runic array. We wouldn't be taking it back with us if I did that."

*I didn't even know what that meant a few weeks ago.* Percy asked Bill runic questions often and Ron had taken to listening in. Most of it was beyond him, but he had gathered some basics. *Wonder what Hermione would say if she knew I was going out of my way to learn stuff.* His bubble of pride popped when he remembered the electives he'd chosen. *Stupid, stupid!*

"It's darker than hell down here," Ron complained in a whisper, squinting through the black void ahead. One of the cursebreakers' wands was lit, but Ron hardly noticed.

"That's typical," Bill explained. "One of the most common wards we deal with is one that blocks light. It's a nightmare to cast, but the Egyptians were *good*."

"Couldn't you, like, I don't know, break it?"

One of Bill's colleagues laughed. Another --- a quiet, older man --- was more serious. "It's not worth the risk. If it's tied into a larger scheme, we could trigger much nastier traps."

"Left or right?" one of the men asked when they came to two branching paths. Sand made up the floor while rough stone of the same colour comprised the walls and ceiling.

"Left," said the man who'd assured them they were getting close. How he knew any of that as they sloped further down into the darkness, Ron knew not.

***August 7, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***10:32 AM***

Harry could hear his robes flapping in the wind as he soared in a great circle around Black Manor. He swerved hard to avoid Regulus, who had been flying the same circle but in the opposite direction.

Harry righted the broom; he had swerved too hard and flown off course. *I thought my Nimbus was responsive. It's like this thing reads my thoughts.*

Regulus signalled for them to land, so they swooped down, touching down just feet from the manor's front door. Both ran hands through windswept hair and grinned.

Few grins had crossed his face these past few days, so lost he was in troubled thoughts. Voldemort's red eyes and pale skin haunted his nightmares, whilst Harry dwelled on that final choice and how it made him feel in his waking moments.

*Not enough... I should feel more, more than just worry it will backfire.* Maybe Grindelwald's visions had done more than he realized. *I still don't want them to stop... oh, Merlin, what's happened to me?*

"What are you thinking?" Regulus asked once the pair stepped inside. Harry made a face; the inner conflict must have shown in his expression.

*If he wants to know, then fine.* "Did you know?"

Regulus frowned. "Know what?"

"Did you know that Voldemort planned to trap me alone on my birthday?"

Regulus paled, but his expression remained calm. "No."

Harry wrung his hands. "You serve him, don't you?"

Regulus stared past Harry and out the nearest window, a far-away look in his dark grey eyes. "I think you knew that already."

*I want to believe him... everything he's ever said seems so honest.* Black Manor was the first home he'd ever known outside of Hogwarts. *I just want this to work out.*

Harry shrugged as casually as he could. "I wanted to see how you answered."

"Clever. If I lied about one, then I lied about the other." Harry nodded. "May I ask whether the Dark Lord asked for your loyalty?"

Harry met his eyes, his stare unblinking. "You swear you didn't know?"

Regulus stared right back. "I swear it."

**Book 3: The Looming of Shadows**

**Chapter 5: Daunting Paths**

***August 6, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***9:33 PM***

Wind rattled the windows, raindrops pounding against the glass. Thunder boomed and Harry looked up from his book. Towering shelves cast long shadows that crawled through pools of flickering torchlight. He had once mistaken those shadows for movements in the corner of his eye, but he had grown used to them.

Until tonight, when all the old ticks returned.

Harry looked out the window to take his mind off things. He could see nothing through heavy sheets of rain but for the tops of distant trees.

He glanced down at his book but grimaced at the first spell. He had stayed away from the more gruesome tomes for over a month, but Voldemort's return changed everything. *I have to be ready. It's the only way I'll ever be free; the only way I won't always be afraid.*

Harry had done well that night and really did believe that Voldemort had no plans of killing him, but he knew that plans could change. The longer he pondered, the clearer his path became. His heart raced just thinking about it --- a long, treacherous path cloaked in death and shadows.

*It's not like I have better options. I could go to Dumbledore, but what would it get me?* House points and less time, he guessed. Would the headmaster still take time to teach him while busy combatting Voldemort? And if he did tell, Voldemort would know... *I hate feeling trapped. I hate being afraid.*

Harry's choices were two pits of vipers, but at least one offered prizes for taking the plunge.

He glanced back down at his book, steeling his nerves.

*Ossio Exploso*

Harry looked from the spell to its diagram, face unchanged by the shifting images of exploding blood and gore. *It doesn't bother me like it would have before.* Harry thought back to a cold, winter's day, stood atop a mountain overlooking Lake Königssee. Gone were the fear and worries about sliding down a slippery slope. All that remained was anger and an iron purpose. *I never want to be like her... I'll never feel helpless again.*

***August 13, 1993***

***Egypt***

***5:57 PM***

Ron looked around one last time. A small village lay behind him, whilst in front, the sand appeared to stretch on forever, covered in long shadows as the sun began setting. A hot breeze blew, kicking up sand that broke against his cloak.

Ron wouldn't miss the sand. It got everywhere and was impossible to clean without magic, but it and the heat were the only things he looked forward to leaving behind.

This trip had been the happiest he'd been since Neville's death. People like Cedric had tried to help, but Bill had done more in three weeks than any of them had in more than a year. Ron found talking with Bill easy. Bill listened and never treated him as if he were made of glass. *I'm gonna miss him.*

A hand landed on his shoulder and he looked up. "You don't look thrilled to leave," said Bill.

Ron swallowed a lump in his throat. "I'd have liked to go on another job or two."

Bill smiled. "Those don't come around all that often, not ones like the last. Most of them would be too dangerous to take you on."

Ron wrung his hands. "But I actually learned stuff this trip --- important stuff, stuff that'll actually help me."

"Study," Bill told him.

Ron grimaced. "It's not the same. I like doing things, not reading about them. I'm good with that sort of stuff and it feels like I was just getting the hang of runes."

Bill raised an eyebrow. "You know you could take them at Hogwarts?"

Self-loathing gnawed at him as he looked down towards the sand. "I can't. We picked our courses ages ago and I chose Care of Magical Creatures and bloody Divination. I just wanted easy classes, I never thought of how useful stuff like runes is."

"You can always ask McGonagall if she can change your timetable."

Ron looked up. "I can?"

Bill let out a long sigh. "She's your Head of House; things like this are exactly what she's there for."

Ron had never thought of it like that. McGonagall had always just been their Transfiguration Professor. *Guess she just doesn't feel like our Head of House compared to Snape running around and giving Slytherins points for breathing.*

"What about Arithmancy? Should I take that, too?"

Bill pursed his lips. "Why do you want to take Ancient Runes?"

Ron scratched his head. "Well, they're dead useful, aren't they?"

"A lot of things are useful. What about their use appeals to you?"

Ron wiped sweat from his forehead. "Wards are important, and you said runes can be used in duels, right?"

"It's an unusual approach, but I've seen it done."

"There you go. I want to take care of myself." His eyes fell back towards the sand. "I want to take care of my friends."

Bill squeezed his shoulder. "Then stick with runes. There's plenty of use for Arithmancy, but it's not the weapon of men who want to fight."

"Ron, hurry!" called his mother, beckoning for him to come back over to where the others gathered around a weathered old saddle.

"Go," said Bill. "Just remember you can write. I'll try and make sure I reply whenever I can."

Ron hugged him before walking off towards the rest of his family, jumping when a hand landed on each of his shoulders.

"Ancient Runes, Ronikins?" Fred asked in a low voice just before they reached their mother.

***Diagon Alley***

***12:04 PM***

Harry stepped through emerald flames and into a dimly-lit room. A well-dressed waiter rushed over. "Welcome, sir, we..." he trailed off, eyes lingering on Harry's forehead.

*Why does everyone stare? It's just a scar.* "I should be under a reservation made by Lord Lucius Malfoy," he said, ignoring the man's stare.

The waiter swallowed. "Right this way, sir."

Draco and Diana were already waiting for him, as were Crabbe, Goyle, and Cassie. Theodore, Cassius, and Pansy had yet to arrive.

"Pass along my thanks to your father," Harry told Draco when he sat down between Diana and Cassie. Draco smiled, but there was no hint of his usual smugness. *Weird. His father probably spent a fortune on this place, I was sure he'd be insufferable.*

Theodore arrived next. Harry watched him closely. *His smiles look strained.* The Notts were notorious blood supremacists and close with the Malfoys. *Is it Voldemort? Is that why he looks so awful?* Harry shuddered at the thought. Surely Theodore's father would keep him away from all of that.

His eyes flicked towards Cassie. She was the oldest in the room, plus the best duellist. *If anyone in our group's gonna be involved, it's her.* The Yaxleys had never been linked to Voldemort, but that meant little, especially when most of Lord Yaxley's friends had been.

Cassius entered, calm as still water. Pansy too looked normal, if a bit flushed.

"I never thought I'd meet anyone less punctual than Cassius," Diana said when Pansy arrived.

Her nostrils flared. "I was being lectured by my parents."

Theodore smirked; it was the most normal he had looked all summer. "That sounds like a convenient way of saying that makeup took longer than you expected."

Pansy rounded on Cassius. "How long were you here before me?"

He shrugged. "About five minutes."

"See? That's not that bad. What was your excuse?"

Cassius grinned. "Flying."

"Flying?" Pansy asked, whirling back to Diana and Theodore. "You have the nerve to give me grief after his excuse was flying?"

"Flying is a perfectly good reason to be late," Draco said with the hint of a smile, turning his grey-eyed stare on Harry. "Don't you agree?"

"Completely."

Pansy huffed. "You're all menaces. No one's safe from the lot of you."

*Oh, Pansy...* His eyes went from the Malfoy siblings to Theodore, and then to Cassie. *You have no idea how right you might be...*

***Hours later, in Knockturn Alley...***

The day was spent shopping and gossiping.

*"Father thinks it's different than last year,"* Draco had said when asked about their next Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor. *"He doesn't think Dumbledore's playing any games at all; he really does think no one wants the job."*

*"Can you blame them?"* Pansy had asked. *"No one's made it the full year since the late sixties."*

*"Skeeter didn't help anything,"* Diana added. *"She brought even more attention to the curse last year, and I bet her book on Dumbledore hasn't helped."*

*"They say he's going to resign as Chief Warlock tomorrow,"* said Theodore.

*"Do you really think any of it's true?"* Pansy asked. Harry forced down a lump of cold. *More than you know.*

Diana nodded. *"Some of it must be. The details are too fleshed out for them all to be fake, but it's Skeeter, so I'm sure plenty of it is nonsense."*

*"Do you think he was really friends with Grindelwald?"*

Harry schooled his features. He alone knew the truth but would say nothing. Those were questions he wanted no part of.

*"It wouldn't surprise me,"* said Cassie. *"Gifted people connecting is pretty normal. Father's been trying to convince me I should start writing to the Romanov heiress. She's apparently a duelling phenom at Durmstrang."*

*"I've thought about trying to write Viktor Krum,"* Draco admitted.

Harry seized the opening to change topics. *"He's the teenage Quidditch phenom, isn't he?* *The one who got subbed in for Bulgaria's World Cup qualifying matches back in June and hasn't missed a snitch?"*

*"That's him,"* said Cassius. *"He's brilliant --- one of the best I've ever seen."*

Pansy's throat clearing halted their conversation before they could get too carried away. *"And what about Dumbledore and Grindelwald?"*

*Damnit, Pansy.* Harry chewed his words. *Careful. "We know Dumbledore had connections. Wasn't he in contact with Flamel before graduating?"*

*"That much has been known for years."*

The sun had begun setting when Cassie proposed a stroll down Knockturn Alley. Harry's heart had missed a beat. His stare became suspicious. *It's like she waited until it was almost time for my meeting there...*

It was the first time Harry had been to Knockturn Alley without an adult, and the first time at night. The buildings looked ugly and grotesque in the light of day, their displays odd but unimpressive. That changed at night, when most of the alley's light came from its larger and more well-lit neighbour. Things that looked comical before lost their humour and made hairs rise on the back of Harry's neck. He fingered his wand, ready to draw at a moment's notice.

No need had come by the time the sun dipped below the tops of nearby buildings. Harry looked around, heart racing. Most of his friends looked unsurprised when he excused himself. Only Pansy asked after him whilst Crabbe and Goyle looked confused. The others were all hard to read.

Harry moved down the dark and deserted streets alone. Briefly he had considered wearing his cloak, but he had dismissed the idea. *If I can't handle walking down an alley, how will I ever be ready for someone like Black?*

Harry stopped in the shadow of a tall building that looked fit to collapse. Plaster peeled from rotting walls and mould crept across grease-stained windows.

"A charming place, isn't it?"

This time he had warning --- Regulus had given him the invitation days ago --- but still the voice made Harry shiver.

"You look different," he said, turning to face the man he knew was Voldemort. Gone was his chalk-white skin and gleaming red eyes, replaced by a strong jaw and carved, handsome cheekbones.

"Coming here would be ill-advised if I looked the same as when we last met."

"You have a good memory. I doubt I could remember what I looked like years ago well enough to recreate it."

If the comment surprised him, Voldemort showed no signs. "You would be surprised by the things a man remembers."

"Occlumency, right? Something about improving memory recall?"

The Dark Lord smiled. "Or maybe you would be unsurprised. Has Dumbledore begun teaching you Occlumency?"

Harry knew his expression had given him away and saw no reason to lie. "It was the only way he'd tell me the prophecy."

"The old man always liked his secrets." Voldemort raised a hand and Harry could feel... something change. *Weird. It's like the wards in Grindelwald's memory, but I can't sense magic like him.* "Occlumency can be used to recall memories perfectly."

*Bloody hell, that sounds useful.* "Passive Occlumency, I'm guessing?" Voldemort nodded. "I haven't learned any of that yet."

"What would you say if I pointed out that you were using it as we speak?"

*What?* Harry frowned. "Probably that I don't know what you're talking about."

"Any time you force yourself calm or inspect your own emotions, you're using a form of Passive Occlumency." Riddle's blue eyes sparkled. "The form is just less interesting than others you could use."

"What would you do if I asked you for that? If my one request was for you to help me master Occlumency."

Voldemort spread his hands. "I would see you become among the world's best."

A bitter taste coated his tongue. *He and Grindelwald talk the same way. It's like they already know their goals will happen just like they plan.* It was hard not believing them.

Voldemort leant forward. "Is this what you're asking of me?"

"I don't know yet," Harry admitted. "I'm still thinking."

"So you have not yet come to a decision?"

"Not yet." The path looked clear, but that last step was daunting. There was still one thing he planned on doing before taking that leap.

"You have until the summer's end," said Voldemort, turning away from him. Harry watched him step into the shadows and vanish without a sound. *Why does everything have to be so complicated?*

***August 18, 1993***

***Black Manor***

***8:56 PM***

Harry sat atop his bed and peered out the nearest window, lost in thought. *Thinking so much about dark lords can't be healthy.* First it had been Grindelwald with his memories, and now it was Voldemort with his return.

The worst part was that, by now, his thoughts just went in circles. *One choice makes Voldemort an enemy and gives me nothing, the other gives me almost anything I want.* He pulled a face. *So why is choosing so hard?*

Could it be his parents? *I never knew them.* Harry tried imagining their disappointed faces and felt naught but anger. They would want the best for him. *If they turned on me for making the smart choice, then they're not worth thinking about.*

No, his parents\' memory wasn't holding him back. *I'm paranoid and don't know what to ask for. I don't know what could be worth the risk.*

Grindelwald's pendant burned beneath his shirt, yet still it felt icy cold against his skin. *This is mad,* he thought, fingering the pendant.

Long hours had been spent lamenting his lack of freedom. Grindelwald wanted to use him more than anyone. *Why doesn't that bug me if I hate being used so much?* Grindelwald had the decency to be honest, which was one thing, but there were other reasons. *He wants to use me for something good, not just so he can be powerful again.*

It was the one problem he had with Malfoy's manipulations. Harry had gained and would say nothing so long as that continued, but he saw what was really going on.

"I wondered when you would next come."

"But you knew I would." Harry looked across the tower cell, watching the man staring at him from atop his battered cot. *I'm not nervous anymore. The memories are working. That should bother me.*

"I expect your return each time you leave, but always I wonder whether I may be wrong."

Harry swallowed a lump in his throat. "I don't think you'll be wrong any time soon."

A smile split Grindelwald's face. "It gladdens me to know you have considered what I have shown you and that my time has not been wasted." He steepled bone-thin fingers and let his smile fall. "I presume you have something for me to consider tonight."

Harry mussed his hair. "I know you can get things out of the cell if you want." Grindelwald remained still and made no attempts at lying. "If I tell you something important, will it stay a secret?"

"You are my last chance to change the world. I would not throw away that chance and your trust for the sake of gossip."

*Merlin, he's telling the truth, I can feel it.* Harry took a deep breath. "Voldemort is back."

"Back?" Grindelwald asked.

"Back," Harry repeated. "No one knows except a few of his followers."

"And you. How is it you came to know his most treasured secret?"

Harry shifted from foot to foot, a cool breeze blowing through the bars and splaying hair across his forehead. "It's complicated. I'm friends with Lucius Malfoy's kids and he's one of Voldemort's followers. There was a party at his manor, but he set up a meeting between Voldemort and I without me knowing."

"Yet you live."

Harry chewed his lip. "I don't think he wants to kill me."

"Explain." It was the sternest he'd ever heard Grindelwald speak.

Harry drummed shaking fingers against his thigh, deciding where to start. "I met him at the end of my first year. He was a wraith or something---"

"A wraith?"

"Or something. He lost his powers when he couldn't kill me. All he could do was possess people or animals. He possessed a professor and tried stealing the Philosopher's Stone."

Grindelwald took it all in stride. "So be it. What was he like?"

Harry frowned. "Kind of like you, but not. He gave me a speech about how awful muggles were and how the Statute of Secrecy was gonna fall. He could have killed me, but he wanted me to join him."

"And I presume he offered something similar upon your recent reunion?"

"Kind of. He wants a chance to win my trust, sort of like you did, but he's offering me anything I want as long as it doesn't go against any of his plans."

Grindelwald's face was unreadable. "A generous offer. Tell me, what do you think of him?"

That was a very loaded question. "What about him?"

Grindelwald closed his eyes. *He looks sad.* "You have not considered the things I asked you to."

Harry blushed, knots tightening in his stomach. *Why do I feel guilty?* "I have," he argued, "I've just been busy with the chamber and now this."

"You must consider things more closely. What is it you dream of? What differences do you plan to make in the world? Answer those questions and judge the merit of others against your own ambitions." Grindelwald waited for that to sink in. "So I ask you again, what is it you think of Voldemort? What does he intend and what do you think of his plans?"

Harry considered. *He really doesn't make it easy.* "He told me that muggles were dangerous and that they should be feared."

"You have no love for muggles. Less, I imagine, than when we first met." Harry scowled and nodded. He thought he'd known evil on Privet Drive, but now when he thought of muggles, he thought of punctured corpses and burning flesh.

His anger boiled and his hands curled into fists. "But they don't scare me."

"Don't they?"

"No," he insisted. "I just wish we weren't hiding. If they find us, everything that happens will be our fault."

A shadow flashed across Grindelwald's face. "Not ours. I have done everything to ensure us a position of power and, in time, I think you will too."

"Do they scare you?"

Grindelwald scowled. "They scared me the day I stood upon a burning pyre, but scarcely since. They are a threat to our existence and must be treated seriously, but the threat can be handled if only we act."

"I think Voldemort's afraid of them. He talks about the Statute falling like it would be a huge disaster. I think he wants to make sure it never happens."

"He is a fool. Someone so powerful should not be so defeated. Does Slytherin not house the ambitious?"

"So you don't like his plan?"

"His plan is meek and futile. The Statute will fall."

Harry shivered. "How can you be so sure?"

Grindelwald studied him. "I have foreseen it."

"Foreseen it?" Harry asked.

"You sound doubtful."

"I just don't think of Divination much, I guess." The words sounded weak, even to him. *You know of at least one prophecy that's true, why can't there be another?*

"Divination is scarce and unwieldy, but that does not mean it is without merit."

Harry nodded. *That should have been obvious.* "What did you see?"

"A shadow wreathed in fire, standing over their foe's charred corpse. A single hurdle stands between them and salvation, a hurdle beyond them or the weapon they carry despite its great power."

A shiver ran up Harry's spine. *If he was anyone else, I'd call him mad.* "You thought it was you," he said instead.

Grindelwald nodded, peering out the window. "It fit. I obtained a weapon of great power and knew I would one day face my greatest foe again."

"Dumbledore?"

"It could be no other."

Harry fidgeted. "But he beat you."

"Only fools believe they can bend the whims of fate. My naivety made me unworthy and I paid for it dearly."

*Weird way to describe it, unworthy.* "That's why you're helping me, isn't it?" he asked. "You think that could be me."

Grindelwald just shrugged his shoulders. "You or another, it matters not to me. I have long-since learned not to meddle in the affairs of fate. I shall not work to further the vision, I will do only what I think is best for the world."

*Him and his riddles...* "And you think what's best for the world is helping me?"

"I do."

"Then what would you do if you were me? What would you do if Voldemort made you an offer?"

"I would seize the opportunity with great caution, lustful of its rewards but wary of its giver."

A part of him breathed a sigh of relief. *That's what I've been thinking for ages.*

"You wish for something else of me," Grindelwald said, watching him. "Ask it."

Harry let out a long breath, running a hand through his hair. "I don't know what to ask from him. I feel like it should be something I can't get from anyone else. I could ask how he survived the backfiring Killing Curse---"

"He would not tell you."

Harry nodded. "That's what I thought." Frustration gnawed at him. "There's so much I could ask for, but I can't think of anything good."

A strong wind blew through the open window, rattling the bars. "There is something. Something that only Voldemort could give you if the whispers are true."

***August 22, 1993***

***The Black Library***

***3:44 PM***

Harry's mind calmed some after his talk with Grindelwald, but it remained plagued. There was no doubt how he felt about muggles, but talking of plans and opinions had gotten him thinking. What was the best way to handle them? *Grindelwald's sounds better. It can't be that hard to take them over --- we have magic.*

Harder to answer were the questions about Sirius Black. A dozen old copies of the *Daily Prophet* littered the desk in front of him. Lucius had been able to get him every paper that ever mentioned Black, but none had been helpful so far. *Narcissa wasn't kidding --- him switching sides really* does *feel random.*

*CRACK!*

Harry looked up with a sigh. *A break might not be the worst thing.* "Hello, Kreacher."

The elf bowed low. "Someone wishes to see you, young master."

Harry frowned. "Who is it?"

"They be telling Kreacher their name is Nott."

Harry had yet to talk alone with Theodore all summer, but every time they had met, he looked troubled. *This should be interesting.* "Send him in, but take these papers first. Leave them in my room, please."

Kreacher bowed and popped away; the papers vanished with him.

Harry walked to the nearest window and peeled back the curtains. The sun was drifting westward and towards a distant forest. The trees' shadows lengthened the further it sank.

The door opened soundlessly behind him; he could sense it despite hearing nothing.

"You look tired," said Theodore.

Harry rubbed at his eyes. "I haven't slept much," he admitted.

"I'm not surprised." Theodore stepped up beside him. "How are you handling everything?"

"Everything?" Harry asked.

Theodore glanced around the room then lowered his voice to a whisper. "We both know he's back." Harry tensed. *At least that answers the question whether or not he knows. Figures. If there was ever an obvious Death Eater, it's Tiberius Nott.* "There's no point pretending we don't."

His heart beat hard. "What else do you know?" Harry asked.

"What else do *you* know?" Theodore returned.

"Probably more than you." Theodore said nothing. "Fine." Now it was Harry's turn to look around the room despite knowing it was empty but for them and several thousand books. "I probably shouldn't need to say this, but let's keep this between us."

Theodore snorted. "I wouldn't have said anything if that wasn't the plan."

Harry collected his thoughts. *Here goes nothing.* "I know he's back and that he's keeping it quiet, and I know that a few of his followers know but that most don't." He looked away from the window, instead watching Theodore. "What about you?"

Theodore wrung his hands. "I know he's trying to recruit you and hoping for some kind of answer soon. Nothing else, really, besides that they're planning something."

Harry rubbed his eyes. "I doubt they're ever not planning something."

"Father's been gone more the last few weeks and he looks tired any time he's home."

"What happened to his hand?" Harry asked, remembering the glove he'd worn at his birthday party.

Theodore looked away. "I don't know. I haven't seen it since getting home from Hogwarts."

Something about that bothered him. *It's like the answer's on the tip of my tongue, but that makes no sense.* "Any guesses about the plan?"

Theodore looked away again. "Something involving Black, maybe? I doubt it's an accident he broke out right after the Dark Lord's return."

Harry scowled, rage churning inside his stomach. *And here we go again with Black...* "You're worried about me now that Black is out, aren't you?"

"We all are. Black was dangerous. There's a reason he was given life in Azkaban."

"I doubt V-the Dark Lord broke him out." Theodore's eyes were wide, his face pale. *Way to slip; you'll have to clean that up if you plan on taking his offer.* "If the Dark Lord broke him out," Harry went on, "I wouldn't need to worry about him, not if he wanted to recruit me."

"I don't know," said Theodore. "Azkaban's an awful place; most prisoners go mad."

Harry clenched his fists so hard, his palms grew hot. "I'm not afraid of him." All he felt was rage akin to the night Aberforth had made him kill the lamb, the night he had brutalized Cadmus Yaxley and revealed he was a Parselmouth.

Theodore sighed. "You're going to go after him, aren't you? The same way you went after the Heir of Slytherin?"

Harry imagined himself standing over Black, his wand aimed at the traitor's chest. A hungry beast roared inside his stomach, calling for blood. *Merlin, I'm just a kid and he's a murderer. What chance do I have?*

*None yet,* another voice whispered, *but with Grindelwald's help...* "I don't know."

Theodore screwed up his face and reached into the pocket of his robes. "At least take this. It might help."

"What is it?" Harry asked, scanning the blank cover of what looked like a very old book.

"One of the books from our family library." Theodore's voice became a whisper again. "Only Notts know the spells in here."

*So the rumours about old families and their magics are true?* That made the book priceless. "Theodore... you're sure?"

Theodore only nodded.

***August 29, 1993***

***Knockturn Alley***

***9:00 PM***

Voldemort was waiting in the shadow of the same building they had last met beneath. The Dark Lord was once more wearing Tom Riddle's face and drumming his fingers against the building's peeling wall.

"Was I late?" Harry asked, frowning.

"No," said Voldemort, removing his hand from the wall. "It's just that I have never been a patient man."

Harry took a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heart. "I still have questions."

"Ask them. I have waited long enough."

Harry steeled his resolve. "You once told me that you worried about the Statute of Secrecy. How do you plan to make sure it never falls?"

"The first step is seizing the ministry. I can begin severing ties more easily then."

*Severing ties? Does that mean the two governments work together?* Frustration gnawed at him but he kept it down. It was a well-worded answer. "What do you want from me?"

Voldemort tilted his head. "I have told you already. I would like an open mind and an opportunity to convince you my ways are right. I mean to one day offer you a place at my side."

Harry studied him, watching for any signs of deception. "So if I say yes, all you expect is that I keep in touch and listen?"

"I expect much from you, but I will not ask for it yet. Not until a firmer relationship has been agreed to." Harry looked for traps in Voldemort's words. "This agreement does not obligate you to fight for me, nor to take my mark."

Harry cleared his mind, steeling his nerves. *Here we go...* "Then I agree."

Voldemort's eyes gleamed. "Excellent. What is it you ask of me in return?"

***Black Manor***

***9:24 AM***

Raindrops drummed against the tall windows. It was hard to see much through the stained glass, but every few minutes, lightning would paint the grounds outside in a wash of white. Harry remembered the first day of school last year and how bright it had been. *That year wound up being a mess, so hopefully this is a good sign.* There was Sirius Black to deal with, but better him than Voldemort. Anxiety clamped down hard on his chest. *If he wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already. It's going to work out.*

"It's going to feel different without you," Regulus said, sipping at his tea.

It would feel different; the whole summer had felt different. *It's the first year I wasn't counting down the days until Hogwarts.* "It's gonna be weird leaving." A shadow crossed Regulus's face, aging him ten years. "Is everything all right?"

Regulus put down his glass. "I owe you an apology."

Harry frowned. "An apology for what?"

"The way I've handled my brother's escape from Azkaban."

"I get it," Harry assured him, "you don't need---"

"Yes, I do. You started off wary of me. I felt like I was making good progress, then I handled everything like a brooding child."

"It's all right," said Harry, blushing.

"None of how I've acted was all right," said Regulus. "I'm not your father and I doubt you want me to be, but you are my ward. I had a responsibility and I neglected that." That same shadow lingered atop his face. "Nothing about that is all right. I'm sorry."

*I don't think an adult has ever apologized to me before.* Dumbledore had, but not so plainly. *I think he regrets how the Dursleys acted more than anything. He wasn't sorry for sticking me with muggles.* The thought made him seethe, but the anger cooled while he stared across the table.

"Thank you," he muttered, unsure what else to say.

Regulus pushed hair back from his eyes. "My parents made many mistakes. Neglecting Sirius and I is just one of them, but I won't repeat it. There are things you should know before you leave."

His pulse quickened. "What kind of things?"

"Things that will help you if my brother attacks."

Harry straightened in his chair. "Like how he fights?"

Regulus looked past him and out the large windows, silent until another flash of lightning came and went. "I can't give you much there. Sirius fought for the Order of the Phoenix before I ever joined the Dark Lord."

Harry frowned. "The what?"

"The Order of the Phoenix. It's what Dumbledore called his vigilante group, but that's not important."

Harry made himself nod, quelling a rush of disappointment. "Right, Sirius."

"Sirius isn't the world's best duellist. They say the Dark Lord trained him, and maybe he did, but I doubt that's changed. Your father was better and so was Snape, but my brother could go toe-to-toe with either of them."

"Because he was smarter?" It was the obvious answer.

A sad smile played across Regulus's lips. "Not exactly. My brother was a Black and a Gryffindor. That's a dangerous combination. All our family's ruthless cunning with a stubborn boldness that goes against all of it."

*That just sounds like it contradicts itself.* "I'm not sure what you mean."

"I mean that predicting what Sirius will do is impossible. People like you and I might expect him to lay traps, then he'll jump out and face you in the open before you're ready. Then you'll learn and play on his pride next time, only for him to order a tactical retreat." Regulus pushed away his glass of tea. "My brother was the closest thing I've ever seen to chaos, and there's no predicting that."

*That sounds like a nightmare.* Harry studied Regulus across the table. "I thought you said you never fought him."

"I grew up with him. No one knows him better than me."

Harry remembered what Theodore said the last time they'd talked. "Theodore says Azkaban might have driven him mad."

"Theodore may be right. Sirius might have changed, but not that part of him. Madness can only change a man so much."

*It sounds like he's said that before, or at least thought it.* "So have a plan, but be ready to change it."

"Exactly."

Harry could do that. There had been no plan last year and still he had prevailed. *So what if I had help, I still did it.* There had been first year, but... *I'm better than that now.*

"Is there anything else?" Harry asked, wiping those dark thoughts from his mind.

Regulus's expression grew grim. "Have you ever heard of the term Animagus?"

***About two hours later, on the Hogwarts Express...***

Harry and Theodore made quiet small talk whilst they waited for the others. Draco arrived first, flanked on either side by Crabbe and Goyle. They had grown this summer; Harry had never seen a pair of third years so large.

"You're later than usual," Theodore remarked once Draco sat down.

"Father talked for longer than usual." It was the second time this past week Draco had missed a chance to look smug when talking about his father.

"Bad news?" Harry asked carefully.

Draco looked out the window. "I'll tell you once Pansy gets here."

Pansy arrived just seconds before the train's departure. Harry noticed that her hair and makeup were perfect --- she looked better than he remembered. *Weird, I just saw her in Diagon.* He shrugged it off. His planned meeting with Voldemort had loomed over him all day; he hadn't exactly been at his best.

Draco's lip curled when Pansy walked in. "Would it kill you to be on time?"

She made a face at him then leaned over Harry to place her luggage in the overhead compartment. Their bodies rubbed together. Pansy shifted but it only made it worse. Harry tried leaning away, but Pansy moved again, still fighting with her trunk. *You're over people touching you and she's just putting up her trunk, calm down.* He forced his mind clear and waited for her to finish, fighting down a blush.

"I don't think it would kill *you* not to be insufferable," Pansy snapped back at Draco once she'd finished, now sitting beside Harry.

"Being insufferable is half the fun. Being late just drags everyone down."

Theodore smirked. "Speaking of being insufferable, are you planning anything for Weasley?"

"No."

Theodore raised an eyebrow and Harry too was surprised. *That was a pretty short answer.* "Are you all right, Draco?" Theodore asked. "Do we need to take you to Pomfrey once we get there?"

Draco sneered. "I've grown up, Nott. You should try it sometime."

*That touched a nerve.* "I *still* haven't heard anything about the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher," said Pansy, pouting. *Good timing.*

Everyone looked at Draco. "Father hasn't mentioned anything; I don't think he knows."

"Dumbledore's leaving it late again," said Theodore.

Harry's thoughts drifted towards the memory of two boys and their talks of muggles and Hallows. "I know we talked about it in Diagon, but I bet Skeeter's book hasn't helped."

"That book really is something," Pansy said with a dreamy smile.

Theodore snorted. "You would think so. Skeeter must be your idol."

Pansy clicked her tongue. "I would never pick an idol with such poor fashion sense." She wrinkled her nose. "That jewellery makes me sick, and don't even get me started on the glasses or the hair---"

Harry cut her off. "There was something you wanted to tell us, Draco?"

Draco looked cross. "I'd hoped to wait a bit longer. It isn't pleasant news."

Harry grimaced. "The news I have is probably worse, so we might as well get it all over with."

"If what you have is worse, we're in for a long year."

"The world doesn't have a habit of doing nice things for me."

Pansy swatted Harry on the arm. "Bad joke," she chided.

Harry blushed. "Sorry."

Draco waited for quiet. "There are going to be guards at Hogwarts this year."

"Guards?" Harry asked. "What's so bad about guards?"

Draco grimaced. "I don't mean aurors."

Pansy paled and Theodore looked ill. "You can't mean---"

"Dementors."

Harry picked through his memories. "I don't know much about dementors, just that they guard Azkaban and that the *Prophet* mentioned they were helping aurors look for Black."

Pansy shivered. "They're awful creatures."

"Effective ones, though," said Theodore.

"What is it they actually do?"

Theodore shifted in his chair. "They feed on happiness. Father... well, he was held there after the Dark Lord fell while he waited for a trial."

Harry's eyes narrowed. *That can't be legal.* "They held him in Azkaban to wait for a trial?"

"Don't sound so surprised," Theodore said darkly. "The ministry didn't play fair last war and they knew they'd been infiltrated. Pretty much anyone they thought might be connected to the Dark Lord got that treatment."

"So he's met them first hand then?"

Theodore nodded. "He says the cold is the worst, says there's nothing like it; like your blood turning to icy water."

"I've heard they make people relive their worst memories," Pansy said quietly.

Now it was Harry who shivered. *Bloody hell. I hope Occlumency works against that.* Wylla Nurmen screamed and seeping blood spread slowly across a field of reddening snow.

Draco who nodded. "Father says they've driven men mad."

"But they won't do anything like that to us, right?" Goyle asked.

"That's not how it works," said Crabbe, surprising all of them. He blushed, looking down at the floor. "I like magical creatures."

Theodore made a sweeping gesture. "No, please, go on."

Crabbe's blush deepened. "Dementors don't see. They just kind of feel around and can't tell most people apart."

"And Dumbledore's letting them guard Hogwarts?" *That doesn't sound like him.*

"I don't think old Dumbles had much choice," said Draco. "His influence isn't what it was. That book has done a number on him. He stepped down as Chief Warlock, but some people still want him off the ICW."

"I'm shocked he's still headmaster," said Pansy.

Harry shook his head. "I'm not. Dumbledore would do anything before giving that up." *And Aberforth was right; he has enough titles to give up so people stay happy.*

"I never thought I'd wish that Dumbledore got his way," Theodore said with a scowl.

"Dementors must have a weakness though, right? Like how boggarts can be fought off with the Riddikulus Charm. They'll probably teach us all how to fight them."

Theodore smirked at him; it was a mirthless expression. "I forget how new you are to all this sometimes. It's cute you're so confident."

Dread crept through him. "You mean there's no way to fight them?" *It would explain why no one had escaped before Black, but that can't be right...*

"There's a spell, but they won't teach it. Father mentioned it once and said it was way beyond NEWT-level. Plenty of aurors can't cast it."

"What's the spell?" Harry asked.

"No idea, I just know there is one."

"Do you still think your news is worse?" Draco asked, leaning back in his seat.

Harry winced. "I wish I could say it wasn't, but I think Sirius Black being an Animagus is pretty bad."

Pansy screamed so loudly beside his ear that he smashed his head against the window.

***Meanwhile, in another compartment...***

Ron leant forward, a card between his fingers. The compartment was quiet as he reached out, waiting to see if the pile of cards would explode. Raindrops drummed against the train outside, but Ron focused on the cards. *Come on, come on.*

"Gah!" A small shape lunged, knocking the cards to the floor and pawing Ron's arm aside, rushing towards Scabbers, who tried scampering away. "Get away from him!" Ron yelled, kicking at the cat.

"Don't kick him!" Hermione shouted.

"Then get him the hell away from Scabbers!"

Hermione huffed but scooped Crookshanks off the seat and into her lap. Scabbers trembled beside Ron. Susan hid a giggle behind her hand whilst Hannah looked nervously from Ron to Hermione. Cedric just stared out the window while the cat's large eyes continued watching Scabbers.

***That evening...***

Their mood remained low, unhelped by the view outside. Rain-soaked trees sagged beneath the weight of dripping leaves and grass lay flat against sludge-filled fields.

Only after the trolley lady's appearance and a brief visit from their older friends did the mood lighten.

"What classes are you taking, Harry?" Pansy asked.

"Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, and Care of Magical Creatures."

Theodore raised a hand across the compartment. "I'll see you there."

Pansy pouted. "I'm only going to see you in Care of Magical Creatures."

"You took Divination?" She nodded. Harry had dismissed that class when choosing back in April, but he was less sure now. *Even if Grindelwald's vision is fake, it's hard to argue with him about magic.* He supposed it mattered not; there was no time for him to take a fourth elective.

Draco looked troubled. "I took the same classes as Pansy, but I think I'm going to ask Professor Snape to change my timetable."

Pansy screwed up her face. "To change it?"

Draco nodded, staring out the window. Now they sped beside a muggle road so covered in water that it reflected dark trees and the grey sky above. "I've reconsidered over the summer; Father's had a lot to do with that." Harry eyed his expression. *I'll bet the Chamber of Secrets had more to do with it than his father.*

Crabbe and Goyle were in the same classes as Draco but had no plans of swapping. Guilt twisted inside his stomach each time Harry looked at Crabbe. How could he have known him for two years and only now realized he liked magical creatures? *The most I've ever talked with him is in Potions, and that's just giving instructions.* The guilt sharpened.

The sky outside darkened and their chatter settled down. Dusk fell then gave way to night. The sky ahead was darker; it made Harry feel like they were nearing the mouth of a great, black tunnel.

Draco was sipping his water when the train lurched. It spilled out over the floor and onto Theodore's robes beside him whilst Draco fell into a fit of coughing. Harry paid them no heed. *Something's wrong.*

"We shouldn't be stopping," he muttered, standing to get a better view out the window. "Damn, I can't see a thing."

"Lumos," Pansy slid nearer, pressing her wand against the glass. Harry squinted through the night. It was like the darkness swarmed every ray of light and snuffed it out. It was like staring into the deep sea long past twilight.

*"My brother was a Black and a Gryffindor. That's a dangerous combination. All our family's ruthless cunning with a stubborn boldness that goes against all of it."*

*"I'm not sure what you mean."*

*"I mean that predicting what Sirius will do is impossible. People like you and I might expect him to lay traps, then he'll jump out and face you in the open before you're ready. Then you'll learn and play on his pride next time, only for him to order a tactical retreat. My brother was the closest thing I've ever seen to chaos, and there's no predicting that."*

"Wands out!" Everyone drew their wands. Harry found himself surprised. *I didn't actually think they'd listen.* The words had come unbidden, spoken without thought.

Still he squinted out the window. *Something's out there, I can feel it.* Had Black learned the dementors would be at Hogwarts? Did he think his chances were better now, before they arrived?

Theodore stepped beside him. "It's blacker than Death out there; I don't know how anyone---" he cut himself off; the train's main door had opened.

Harry drew a finger across his lips and silently aimed his wand towards their compartment door. *Let him try; I'll bury him in curses before he casts a spell!*

Someone screamed from further up the train, then there was silence. Harry pricked his ears, waiting for more. Not so much as a footstep came from outside their door, but Harry could sense someone moving outside.

The compartment opened silently and someone stepped across the threshold.

"OSSIO EXPLOSSO!"

The spell slammed against Black's chest. Glee lit inside Harry, burning away all but itself and a sick satisfaction. *Everyone was so worried about him. Azkaban must have made him---*

His mouth fell open. Black continued walking --- no, gliding --- towards him. *It can't be Black,* Harry realized as the pieces came together. A hooded head loomed near the ceiling and its owner moved with inhuman grace.

A long, rattling breath came from beneath the hood. The torches died, Pansy's Lumos charm went out, and cold crept beneath Harry's skin. *A dementor.*

Pansy slumped back into the seat behind her and Theodore stood, frozen and trembling. *Great* --- Theodore had been the most knowledgeable of them when it came to dementors.

Harry looked at the others. Crabbe was slumped on the compartment's floor, his knees pulled up to his chest. Goyle looked lucid but cowered in a corner whilst Draco... *Merlin, he looks bad.* His wand had fallen from nerveless fingers and he trembled worse than any of them.

*"Father says they've driven men mad."*

*Why not me?* Harry stared towards the creature's head. Memories came, but he remained unbroken. Starved nights in his cupboard on Privet Drive, the awful sound when Longbottom's neck snapped, pale snow drinking Wylla Nurmen's dying blood, white-hot flames licking up his legs. His scar throbbed, but he felt little else. *Maybe Grindelwald really did drive me insane and I just didn't realize.*

Harry threw another spell at the dementor. It winked out against its chest, but the monster turned its head towards him. "Leave!"

The dementor cocked its head. It did not retreat, but neither did it advance. Harry stepped forward, brandishing his wand.

The dementor lurched, arms raised wardingly towards Harry. *What the...* There was nothing else for it. "I said leave!"

The dementor glided wordlessly from the compartment. Torches burst back to life and the door slid shut.

Harry sagged back into his seat, wincing and exhausted. Every inch of him felt heavy and his eyelids fluttered beneath his burning scar. *What are the odds? Of course Voldemort just happens to do something big right while I'm in the middle of all this nonsense.*

**Chapter 8: Broken Pacts**

***September 1, 1993***

***Hogsmeade Station***

***9:09 PM***

The train buzzed with students speculating about the dementor. Harry's friends talked too, but their tones were different.

"Merlin," Theodore breathed in awe, "Harry, you just... I've never seen anything like it."

"That was incredible!" Pansy praised.

Draco had only the strength to nod. *The dementor really got to him.* His scar gave another throb, but Harry ignored it. *Why not me?* he thought for the hundredth time. *I've gone through much worse than Draco.*

The rain was falling hard when they stepped off the train. Thunder boomed and lightning lit the silhouette of Hogwarts in the distance, veiled by heavy sheets of rain.

Harry was grateful for the weather. It offered an escape from the praise and questions since his friends could hardly hear each other, even when nestled in the carriages.

They were all soaked and shivering by the time they finally stepped inside. Harry nearly ran head-first into Weasley being led away by Madam Pomfrey. *What the hell is that about?* He looked over his shoulder to watch and saw that Granger was walking in the wrong direction too, following in the footsteps of Professor McGonagall. *Merlin, what have they gotten into this time?*

"Harry, a word?"

Harry smiled and waved his friends on. "Sure, Cassius, what's up?"

Cassius glanced back over his shoulder and Harry took the hint, picking through the crowd and into the alcove beneath the marble staircase. Harry hissed quietly and the doorknob appeared.

Cassius shivered. "Merlin, that's creepy," he said once they'd entered the passage and closed the door behind them.

Harry rubbed at his scar. The pain had largely faded, but a stubborn prickle remained. "What is?"

"You know... the hissing."

Harry shrugged. "All of Slytherin knows I can do it. There's no point in hiding it so long as only you lot are around."

"I'll get used to it, it might just take a while. When anyone like us thinks about Parseltongue..." The rest went unsaid --- they thought about Voldemort.

"Well, I'm not him."

"I know," said Cassius, looking away, "just... there have been rumours."

*So Cassius really doesn't know.* Harry wondered once more just how many of his friends knew what was happening. "I get it, just don't expect me not to use it."

Cassius gave a nervous half-smile. "Yeah, of course. How are you holding up?"

Harry frowned. "Me?"

"Yeah, you know... the dementor. It got me pretty good and I think we've both been through some stuff. I just figured..." he let his voice trail off.

*Cassius might be the best friend I have.* No one else had ever checked on him this way --- no one but Diana, whose loyalties remained unsure. "It didn't seem to affect me," he admitted.

Cassius looked puzzled. "Didn't affect you?"

"I don't know how else to say it. It got to everyone else, but I was fine. Colder than hell until Crabbe told us to eat some chocolate, but that was about it." Cassius looked pensive. "I know Occlumency, maybe that was it."

Cassius wiped stray drops of water from his brow. "Maybe. I've only ever heard of Occlumency, so I can't say much. You figure some of the prisoners would know it, though, and they say dementors get to all of them in the end."

*It makes no sense.* "It was only in the compartment for a minute. Maybe it would have gotten to me if it stayed longer."

Cassius nodded, but he was still frowning. "We should get to the feast. No good to miss the sorting and all that."

They slipped silently into the hall partway through the sorting. A thousand plates and goblets gleamed beneath the cloud-filled ceiling. The ghosts appeared brighter than usual against the bleakness outside; all except the Bloody Baron, who stood silent as ever.

"Did I miss anything interesting?" Harry asked, sitting between Theodore and Pansy.

Pansy yawned. "A few new first years, but no one that interesting. Millicent's younger brother, Arthur, the Avery heir, and one other. Daphne's---"

"Greengrass, Astoria!"

Pansy cut herself off; there was no need to finish.

Harry watched Astoria's path towards the stool. Her head was high but he noticed her shoulders shaking and saw that her hands were in her robes. Her hair was darker than her sister's and she was shorter than Daphne had been at that age.

Harry felt the stare and turned, meeting narrow, sapphire eyes. Her hand gripped the table's edge, knuckles white against the emerald cloth. *She doesn't like the idea of me being around her sister.*

Harry smiled mockingly then turned back around just in time for the hat to shout "SLYTHERIN!"

*Interesting,* Harry thought, watching Astoria walk across the hall. Daphne's betrayal still weighed heavily in his thoughts. Watching her sister brought all those feelings back. *She probably hates me; Merlin only knows what Daphne's told her.* But if she didn't...

A Macnair, a Rowle, and a Thicknesse joined Slytherin. Harry recognized the first two names, and Pansy mentioned that there was a rising ministry official named Thicknesse working in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.

The sorting concluded when a dark-haired girl named Romilda Vane was sorted into Gryffindor.

Dumbledore rose from the staff table, but the hall did not quiet. A wall of chatter wafted through the hall, breaking against Dumbledore like snow against the castle walls. *I've never seen anyone look so unbothered by something like this.*

"We are a restless bunch tonight," Dumbledore said once quiet prevailed. "I will not try and hold back the tide. Let the merrymaking begin!"

The scents of beef and bacon intermingled with the smell of gravy, fresh fruit, and a dozen other unnamed things. They all wafted through the hall, hanging in the air like the rain-filled clouds outside. Chatter soon erupted, whistling through the room like a gusting wind, taking all decorum with it.

"You never did explain what happened with her," Pansy whispered in Harry's ear, jerking her head towards Daphne.

Harry swallowed a mouthful of mashed potatoes. "I'd rather not."

Pansy made large, puppy eyes. "Please?"

Harry sighed. He had planned to keep his friends out of it since he doubted Daphne would involve them, but Pansy talked with her often. *She has the right to know.* "She tried poisoning me in November, then rigged an exploding statue later in the year."

Pansy clamped a hand to her mouth. "What? Why?"

Harry scowled. "She thought I was the Heir of Slytherin."

"Then why was she still glaring at you? She knows that isn't true now."

That was an interesting question, but Harry thought he knew. *She's so sure she's right, just like Voldemort and Grindelwald.* Daphne would never be their equal with a wand, but she was probably the smartest witch at Hogwarts. *Anyone that smart is always so sure they're right.* Harry had learned that while dealing with the two dark lords.

"I guess you'd have to ask her," he said instead, sawing at his steak.

Pansy huffed. "I don't think I will."

"You're friends, aren't you?" Harry asked without looking up.

"We *were* friends, but not anymore." She smiled. "You were always better than her."

"That girl could be the world's greatest spy if she learned to hold her tongue," Theodore said while Pansy visited with other friends further up the table.

Draco set down his goblet. "I don't think she could. She's too emotional."

Theodore laughed. "Look who's talking, Draco."

Draco sneered. "I told you already, I've grown up. She hasn't yet, and neither have you. You learn from your mistakes once you do."

Theodore sneered right back. "Some of us don't need to transform ourselves to be decent human beings."

Harry ignored them, focusing on the food. *I feel like a fat slob or something.* No one around him was eating half so much. Then he remembered the dementor and wondered again why he had been so unaffected.

Pansy soon returned, vibrating with excitement. "Have you heard?" she asked them.

"Heard what?" asked Theodore.

"About Weasley?"

Draco yawned. "Which one? There are about a dozen of them and I don't expect that woman's done making more."

"Oh, cut it out, you know which one I'm talking about."

"King Weasley?" Theodore asked, smirking. Many Slytherins had taken to calling Ron that after his fumbled catch during their Quidditch match last November.

"Yes, him."

Draco scowled. "I can't say I've cared enough to pay attention. Why? Should I have heard something?"

Pansy giggled. "He had a fit on the train; he fell off his seat and everything! The big, bad Quidditch star was afraid of the dementor! Someone even told me he wet himself!"

Harry ignored them again. Never before had he played these games and he would not start now --- certainly not whilst remembering a night sitting out near the Black Lake. *I don't remember them being so cocky when the dementor walked in, and Weasley has a better reason to be afraid.*

The food vanished, replaced by desserts of all names. Harry smelt chocolate, cinnamon, and a dozen other things that he could name. The hall grew louder in the minutes to come, reenergized by the sugar. Crabbe had limped through dinner all night, clearly still plagued by the dementor's effects, but he burned through dessert with a fervour that Dudley would have envied.

Harry looked away. *No one should have that much in their mouth at once.* He looked up at the staff table and noticed only one difference. A man in tattered robes sat beside Professor McGonagall, his hair streaked with grey. Harry frowned. *Is he the new professor?* The man looked like someone he would stumble across in Knockturn Alley.

Harry tapped Pansy on the shoulder. "Who's that?" he asked, pointing.

"He must be the new Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor."

"I gathered that. I was wondering if you knew who he was."

"Oh," she blushed. "I don't think I've ever seen him before."

"It doesn't matter," said Theodore, who must have been eavesdropping. "Dumbledore will tell us soon enough."

The desserts vanished not five minutes later, taking the gilded plates and goblets with them.

This time the hall quieted more quickly when Dumbledore stood. "Welcome! I sense you are wearier than usual, so I shan't keep you long.

"First years should note that the forest on the edge of the grounds is called the Forbidden Forest for a reason. It is not a place to be trifled with and anyone caught sneaking through it will be punished.

"Those interested in playing for their House Quidditch teams should present themselves to their heads of house by the end of next week. Tryouts will be arranged by your respective captains sometime this month. I look forward to a full and exciting year of Quidditch after its forced cancellation last May."

One of the Weasley twins whooped from the Gryffindor table and soon the hall was filled with raucous applause.

Dumbledore smiled. "I hope you're as enthusiastic for your new professor." Quiet muttering replaced the cheers and Dumbledore waited for silence before continuing. "This year, Professor Lupin will be taking on the daunting prospect of teaching you all Defence Against the Dark Arts."

There was polite applause, but nothing like the stir Aberforth's hiring had caused last year.

"On to less pleasant news. As you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are here on Ministry of Magic business." *He really isn't happy; he went out of his way to make sure we know it wasn't his fault.*

"They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds," Dumbledore continued, "and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises --- or even invisibility cloaks." Harry kept his expression still.

"It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors."

Ringing silence rang through the hall. Not even the Weasley twins stirred.

Dumbledore smiled again. "Now, you are all weary and I fear that I have troubled you. Off to bed with you all."

Harry stepped up beside Draco whilst they moved towards the stone steps leading down into the dungeons. "You actually respect him, don't you?"

"Who?" Draco whispered back, glancing around them. The only ones nearby were the rest of their friends, but they had fallen several paces back.

"Weasley."

Draco sneered, but it looked half-hearted. "Something like that," he muttered, looking away and slowing his stride so that the others caught up.

"Excuse me?"

A tall girl blocked their path. *Not that tall,* Harry realized, eyeing the Head Girl badge on her chest, *just older.*

"Yes?"

"You're Harry Potter, right?" *As if she doesn't know.* He nodded. "I've been told to give this to you." Harry took the offered parchment, wondering why she, of all people, had been sent to pass it on.

*Harry,*

*It would be my pleasure to speak with you this Friday evening if you would indulge an old man and his whims. We have much to discuss with such a chaotic year ahead of us and I think it would behoove both of us to do so promptly.*

*Yours truly,*

*Albus Dumbledore*

*PS: After many years of procrastination, I have finally tried and taken a liking to Fizzing Whizbees!*

Harry nearly snorted. Someone as brilliant as Dumbledore was bound to have some quirks, but Merlin, did that man ever have his.

***August 19, 1899***

***The Dumbledore Family Home***

***11:33 AM***

That morning dawned brightly. Leaves bathed in warm sunlight beneath a deep-blue sky and the grass was soft underfoot. Everything appeared starker in this sunlight; the grass was greener, the trees more lush, and the sky a perfect shade of blue.

None of it made Gellert regret their plans. They would leave on the morrow and head for France, where Nicholas Flamel had arranged Albus a meeting with the French Minister for Magic.

The man knew naught what Albus planned to say, nor that a friend would accompany him. That had been when Gellert knew he'd won. *Albus would not risk that connection if he was anything less than devoted.*

*"There is no better place to start,"* Albus had said. *"We must try to win world powers to our side with words."*

Gellert would have agreed to anything. It had taken time to convince Albus this was their only course. The world would be better for it, but Albus thought too often of the smaller problems that their pursuit would fix in time.

Everything was decided. Albus's siblings would stay with a friend he'd met at school --- a strange fellow named Elphias Doge. Aberforth had raged, but Albus had not wavered. Gellert had smiled at Aberforth just before he left the room. *Foolishness never wins.*

"I can't believe we're leaving," Albus muttered, looking up and over the tops of distant trees.

"The time has come," Gellert said with reverence.

"Part of me still wonders how you convinced me."

Gellert smirked. "You knew that I was right. Little convincing was needed." It was untrue, but better to let Albus believe. *His recent decisiveness does him credit.*

A door slammed behind them. Gellert tensed but kept his eyes forward until Albus gasped beside him.

He turned his head. The fool boy was back, but that was not what stilled Gellert's heart. *No! This can't happen!* The girl hung limply in his arms, mouth ajar and pale strands of hair splayed across her forehead. Panic seized him, but not for the child. *No... not now, not this close.*

"Aberforth!" Albus rushed forward and took the girl from his arms. "What happened?"

"Your plans are dead, you won't be running off with him." Aberforth spat the last word like it was something foul, glaring at Gellert over his brother's shoulder. *The mounting anger pours from him in a last-ditch attempt.* Nothing scared him worse than the idea that it might just work.

*He cannot be allowed to ruin this.* "You watch your tongue, you hear me?" Gellert spat back, his blood pumping. "Do not ever---"

"Gellert! That's enough!" Gellert growled then fell silent. Albus looked up, still kneeling over his sister. "Explain yourself, Aberforth."

"Explain myself?!" the boy raged, spit flying. "Look at her! Does she look prepared for the care of your dim-witted friend?"

Albus took a deep breath. "Elphias is sharper than you realize. You will speak of him with respect---"

"I will speak how I choose!" The boy was shaking now, soundless tears rolling down his cheeks. Gellert's stomach nodded, but not for the boy.

"Aberforth, listen to me---"

"No, Albus! I've listened long enough. Look where it's gotten us! LOOK AT HER!" Albus's eyes fell towards his sister and Gellert watched his shoulders sag. "You know I can't control her during the fits. This is your fault. You must stay behind and care for her. Her death will be on your hands if you leave."

"You go too far!" Gellert roared, drawing his wand. "Your incompetence should shackle no one."

The boy's own wand appeared in his hand. "It isn't about competence, Grindelwald! Albus has practised, I can't---"

"Excuses!" Aberforth's hand trembled and his wand's tip sparked. *Give me a reason, you worm.*

"Excuses? Is that what you'll tell your victims' families?"

Albus looked up. "Aberforth! You will hold your tongue!"

"No," said Gellert, "go on."

"You would watch my sister rot if it got you an ounce of what you wanted. No one means anything compared to your goals. You know nothing of love; all you know is greed and dominance."

"Aberforth!" snapped Albus. "I said that's enough!"

"No," said Gellert, his voice low, "he's right."

Albus's eyes swivelled towards him. "Gellert... you can't mean that."

Gellert banished the last of his restraint. *I can't believe this is happening.* "If love is what shackles you and blinds your brother, then he is right, I know nothing of love."

"See?" Aberforth shouted, brandishing his wand. "He admits it!"

"Not to all of it. You think I wish death upon your sister? Her state means more to me than you will ever understand. It represents our failure. Every fit she has pulls at my heart and makes me wonder why I wait here and do nothing."

"You don't care!" Aberforth hissed. "It's all about you and your ambitions."

"My ambitions dwarf all; everything I do is for the greater good."

Half a dozen curses leapt towards him, but Gellert cast wordless counters and they sparked out before reaching him. Another spell built in the boy's wand, but Gellert flicked his hand and knocked him flat against the grass.

"Stop this!" cried Albus, his voice cracking like weathered stone.

Aberforth sucked in a long breath, rising from the grass. "No! He dies here!"

Gellert neutralized the boy's next spell. An invisible whip cracked and the child went sprawling again. *Pathetic.* Gellert readied his wand.

The boy lunged. "AVADA---"

"CRUCIO!"

He cast without thinking, unprepared to hear the Killing Curse's first verse. The Unforgivable plucked Aberforth from mid-air. For a moment he hung --- suspended and thrashing --- before falling to the grass, writhing like a snake with its tail caught beneath a hunter's boot.

Blood thundered in Gellert's ears. *Let him suffer; let him learn what it is to play with the Unforgivable Curses.*

A rocky spire jutted up between them, breaking his concentration.

Gellert turned slowly, facing a familiar face whose wand was trained on him. "Leave."

Ice seeped through his veins. *He can't take his side.* "Did you not hear the spell your brother---"

"I said leave, Gellert. You've done enough."

*You bastard!* Something shattered inside his chest. "Our plans---"

"Can wait --- if they still go on at all. Just... go."

Silence hung between them but for their robes flapping in a late-summer's breeze. "You would abandon our ambitions?"

Pain slashed across Albus's face. "They are my family, Gellert. I can't just leave them."

"And what of the muggles who did this to your family?"

"Ariana's accident was our fault. If we had been more careful---"

"YOUR INCOMPETENCE IS NOT THE POINT!" Gellert hated him! A hundred daggers buried themselves hilt deep in his chest. *Why does it hurt so much?* He took a deep, shuddering breath. "I loved you." Silent tears stung his eyes and blurred his vision. "We were to unite the Hallows and become Masters of Death. My life's work, Albus; I was willing to share this with you."

Gellert saw the pain in his best friend's eyes, saw Albus steeling himself for what would come next. "I was mistaken to agree. I will no longer be part of your plans, Grindelwald."

The knives burned inside his chest. "Then we duel."

"No!"

*You've made your choice.* "Fight me!"

"NO!" Albus slipped his wand back up his sleeve. "Go!"

Gellert studied him, the heat still eating at his chest. "You would let me leave, knowing what I plan?"

Albus stared back at him. "Yes."

His hands curled into fists. "The weaklings will ask for your aid. We will meet again."

The wind blew strands of auburn hair across his friend's forehead. "Perhaps."

Gellert closed his eyes and snuffed the building heat. "We end this now."

"No."

"Yes." Aberforth crawled out from behind the jutting stone, clutching at the hem of his brother's robes. "Albus, listen to what he's saying. We should take him. Together, we could do it."

"No."

Gellert levelled his wand at Albus, his sister's slowly stirring body the only thing between them. "Arm yourself, Dumbledore!" Albus remained still. "Arm yourself now!"

Albus looked away. "I will not fight you, Gellert."

His heartstrings tugged. *Must I do this?* "Fine; have it your way." Gellert let his wand's tip fall, now aimed down at Ariana. "Crucio."

The girl screamed and Albus drew his wand. Gellert ended the spell. The spire exploded. Shrapnel intercepted Gellert's curses then burst into flame, pelting back towards him.

Gellert banished himself a dozen feet back and thrust his wand above his head. The fire streamed skyward, now a single molten sphere that fell towards Albus like a shooting star.

Grass burned and stone smouldered, giving way beneath the fire. A flaming tornado surrounded the spot where Albus had stood, sending waves of heat rippling out in all directions.

Gellert lowered his wand, wincing as his skin stiffened against the heat. Something panged inside his stomach, raising bile to his throat. White-hot needles prodded at his cheeks. He turned to leave. "No!" Aberforth screamed. "You bastard!"

"It is finished." Sweat rolled down Gellert's face.

"Like hell it is!"

Gellert spun and batted away the first curse. Spells flew back and forth until Aberforth was blasted back again. Gellert sneered down at him, this creature who had ruined everything. Green light seeped from the end of his wand, the curse building.

The blazing twister broke apart, sent skyward for a second time. Gellert whirled just in time to see it vanish in the waiting maw of a dragon made entirely from water, looming higher than the houses or trees. The dragon collapsed, rolling towards him in a single, destructive wave. It slammed against a silver shield that wavered. Gellert strained and grimaced.

The water reared back, once more a roaring dragon preparing to strike.

*This is no animation. This is Drochuisc*. Fear gnawed at him for the first time that day. *One of the four elemental incarnations of hatred --- I thought them no more than myths.*

Gellert grunted and slowed time.

*Thump, thump!*

Not truly, but close enough. His mind processed things inhumanly swift in this state so that everything around him appeared to crawl. It was a perilous trick and he dared only use it in times like these; when eye-blinks could be the difference between life and death.

*Thump, thump!*

*Five heartbeats --- I dare not risk longer.* His shock ebbed. *Better.* Never had he expected something like this. *If one exists, they all must.* Four meaningless incantations, or so he'd thought. *Albus has greater control than I; my counter must be swift.*

*Thump, thump!*

The world sped back up. "TALAMHOLC!"

Stones cracked with a sound like thunder and a hundred monsters crawled from the earth, made of stone and clay.

The dragon lunged but was met halfway. Gellert's face twisted with pain. It was like the spell was tearing him apart.

Gellert snarled and swept his wand outwards, forcing the spell into a solid mass of earth and stone that absorbed the dragon's strike, then curled around it. Both spells broke; sopping earth crumbled like sand at high tide and water sloshed out across the yard. Tree-sized stones hit the ground so hard it trembled, but Gellert looked past all of that.

Albus stood facing him, wand outstretched. Both of them were flushed and gasping, but Gellert attacked; a simple barrage of curses fired off in quick succession. *I cannot win a game of control; I must beat him this way.* The two exchanged curses so fast that Gellert lost track of whose spells were whose.

Footsteps pounded near. His earlier fear returned. *I must end this quickly; I cannot beat both of them.*

"AVADA KEDAVRA!"

Green light leapt hungrily from the tip of Gellert's wand, but the nearest wall split off and intercepted the spell. The stone shattered into a hundred shards that hung --- momentarily suspended between him and Albus --- some of them blazing.

Gellert dilated again, seeking gaps in the stones through which to fire curses. It was imprecise work; there was no telling whether the stones would fall faster than his spells could move.

He let the world speed up again and fired at the same time as Albus. His aim was true and sailed through a pair of stones that obscured his rival's view. A single spell slipped through a different pair of stones, hissing towards Gellert, who raised his wand.

A shrill scream filled the warm, summer air and a small body slumped against the sopping grass.

The duel ended with her heartbeat. Albus dropped his wand and lurched forward, cradling his sister's lifeless corpse. *She's dead; I saw that spell.* Albus knew it too, though Gellert knew he had not seen it. *I should kill him; he might wonder if I did it, his wrath would be fierce.*

Gellert raised his wand, aiming past the spot where Aberforth sat gaping and towards his brother's back. He could hear the words inside his head, but they melted on his tongue each time he tried saying them. *He could die never knowing that he killed her; there would be mercy in that.* Still his hand shook and now tears stung his eyes again.

*I'm sorry, Albus, for your loss and for the future. It will be harder this way.* The blue sky faded as he whirled, leaving Godric's Hollow far behind him.

***The Great Hall***

***8:36 AM***

Harry was accustomed to being the first awake, but Theodore had risen first that morning. Harry ignored his stare as he hurriedly dressed, preparing for breakfast. *At least he woke me before the others noticed I was still asleep.*

Harry cast his mind back to last night's vision as they moved up towards the Great Hall. *How did Skeeter get so much right?* Some of the details might be wrong, but it was incredible. *No one's known any of this for almost a hundred years, but she just fished all of it up in a few months?*

Harry moved on; some mysteries would never be solved. The duel had been incredible and he could hardly blame Grindelwald for snapping. *Merlin knows how good an agitator Aberforth is.* The only thing that bothered him was the one thing Skeeter had gotten wrong.

***The previous night...***

The pockmarked grass and sun-kissed sky faded. "You look well."

"You didn't expect me to, did you?" Harry asked, opening his eyes to see a familiar tower cell.

Grindelwald tilted his head. "I was unsure. You have changed these past months."

"It would have made me sick a year ago," said Harry, walking towards the barred window and looking out. It was a long way to the mountain's peak and further still to the waters of Lake Königssee far below it.

"And what does it do now?" Grindelwald asked, watching him, hands folded atop his chest. *It reminds me of how Dumbledore stands sometimes.*

"The Cruciatus Curse on Ariana... that was the bit I didn't like." *Only one bit that bothered me... I really am changing.* All he could do was hope it was for the best.

"It was regrettable." *He sounds like he means it.* "I administered a small fraction of the curse's power and only for a heartbeat. It was impulsive and immoral, I was not thinking clearly."

Harry shook his head. "You recovered fast. That duel... I've never seen anything like it. I wish I could fight that way. I wouldn't have to let other people control everything and just go along with it."

"You will learn." Harry nodded, still peering out the room's lone window. "You doubt me?"

His face twisted into a grimace. "Some of that magic... it just feels impossible." Harry turned back towards Grindelwald. "What is Fiendfyre?"

Grindelwald stood still. "What inspired this question?"

"You compared the water Dumbledore conjured to something you thought of as Fiendfyre, but I've never heard of it."

"I am unsurprised. It is among the most evil of magics."

*Evil? Weird word for him to use.* Harry chewed his words. "I didn't think you considered any magic evil. Haven't dark lords in the past always said magic is just magic?"

"I am no dark lord, I act for the world." Harry nodded; it's not like there was much else to do. "Their words are true, when taken in most forms. I generally believe it is the application of the thing which can be morally categorized and not the thing itself."

"But you called Fiendfyre evil?"

"I did."

"Why?"

"Fiendfyre is unlike other magic. It is autonomous. It is hatred given form; its only purpose is to destroy."

"You thought something like that about the spell you used to counter the water. Something about how much destruction it would cause if you couldn't control it."

Grindelwald rubbed at his temples. "Its function is the same. Fiendfyre, Drochuisc, Talamholc, and Sgriosàile --- the four elemental incarnations of hatred. I call them evil because, in their purest forms, they are manifestations of blind malevolence."

Harry found himself leaning forward. "But they can be controlled?"

"Only by the exceptionally skilled. They were called myths for centuries due to their scarcity. It takes a uniquely gifted magician to master any of them."

Harry imagined roaring winds buffeting wine-red fire and water surging up through broken earth. "What about all of them?"

"It is impossible."

Harry frowned. "Why?"

Grindelwald chewed his words. "Aristotle believed everything was made from elements later named for him. This is, of course, untrue, but his beliefs are not unfounded."

"What do you mean?" The best way to get answers from Grindelwald was to ask a leading question, then listen.

"It is the belief of many that magic found its roots in the creative mind. Some believe that things once sprung into being to match how we perceived the world. Those who support this idea often cite that the creation process is the root of all magic and claim that what we use today is the same force that has been weakened by time and stagnation."

Harry took that in; it was a mad idea. *It all sounds nuts.* "What do you think?"

"There is merit in the idea. Magic and its capacity to create may well be linked to the beginning of all things. I am more sceptical of the idea that it once worked so fluidly, subconscious thought brought concepts into existence, but the truth matters very little. What is important is that the Aristotelian elements are often linked back to this concept."

"Why?" Harry asked again, not yet seeing a connection.

"Because it is said certain kinds of people more often imagined, and therefore created, some elements more than others. None of this matters, in truth. It is commonly viewed as a folktale used to justify our shortcomings. The truth is that one magician can only ever wield two of them. One cannot wield opposing elements."

Harry pondered for a moment. "So if someone could use air and fire, they wouldn't be able to use earth and water?"

Grindelwald waved a hand. "Their use in most conventional magics would be unchanged, but they would be unable to wield them as incarnations of hatred."

"So your two were earth and fire?"

"Yes, my affinities were for earth and fire."

"And Dumbledore?"

"Water and earth, though I suspect that may have changed in later years."

Harry raised his eyebrows. "Affinities can change?"

"I have never known it to happen, but one's Patronus can change and that is the purest representation of the caster one can imagine."

Harry rolled his eyes. "You keep just assuming I know these spells you're talking about."

Grindelwald smiled. "I am using terminology you are unfamiliar with in the hope of fostering further questions."

*Git. At least he's honest.* "Fine. What's a Patronus?"

"A Patronus is the result of the Patronus Charm, the only known defence against dementors."

Harry perked up. "They're at Hogwarts this year."

Grindelwald unfolded his hands. "Dementors are posted at a school?"

Harry took a deep breath, trying to ignore the rage bubbling up beneath his skin. "Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban. He betrayed Dumbledore and my parents in the last war. He sold their location to Voldemort, then joined him. Some say he was his lieutenant near the end. No one knows for sure, but either way, he's dangerous; the only man ever to escape from Azkaban."

Grindelwald's eyes were like blue ice. "You ought to tell me things of this nature."

"Why?" Harry asked. "It's not like you can do anything about it whilst locked up here."

"I need not do anything at all. I need only to prepare you for what may come."

***Back in the present...***

It was hard not being happy with the talk they'd had despite how the image of Grindelwald's wand trained on Ariana made him feel. *That happened a hundred years ago, there's nothing to be done. Focus on yourself.*

The best way of serving himself was working with Grindelwald. The thought still made him nervous, but it was the only path forward. *How else will I ever get free? People using me is helping me now, but it won't always. I need power.*

Harry had said as much to Grindelwald, who had agreed to help him. *"I will help only so long as you continue making the best of my teachings. Laziness will not be tolerated --- lazy men do not change the world.*"

Grindelwald's first lecture had been on non-verbal casting. Harry was to master it by Samhain, which he thought sounded insane. *That's in the sixth-year curriculum and Cassie told me half of them struggle. How am I supposed to do it?* But he had not complained; that was another thing he doubted Grindelwald would tolerate. *At least I know some Occlumency, he said that would help.*

Timetables were soon passed around. Harry looked down at his. It was much fuller than it had been last year. *There's no way I could have taken Divination; it's literally impossible.* That first day alone, they had Transfiguration and Defence Against the Dark Arts in the morning, Care of Magical Creatures immediately after lunch, and then an Arithmancy double to end the day.

Divination would remain untaken. Harry had begun studying some Ancient Runes last year after Daphne demonstrated just how useful they could be. They proved both fascinating and versatile. *Not a subject I'd give up.* Then there was Arithmancy, a fundamental component of magic involved in things like Alchemy and Spell Creation. *I can't give that up, either.* Care of Magical Creatures was the least intriguing of the three, but with dementors at Hogwarts, it felt more important than ever. *Grindelwald can talk about Divination all he wants; I made the right choices.*

When the last of them finished breakfast, Harry and his group began moving towards the Great Hall's exit.

"Potter!"

*Must he do this on the first day?* Harry schooled his features before he turned around. *I won't give Snape any more reasons to make my life a pain.* "Professor?"

"Come." Snape strode off towards the stone steps leading into the dungeons, gesturing for him to follow.

"We'll tell McGonagall where you are," Pansy promised before moving off with Draco, Theodore, Crabbe, and Goyle.

Harry and Snape left the noise-filled hall behind. They walked in silence past the decoy corridor and the Slytherin common room, their footsteps echoing against the stone walls, floors, and ceilings until they reached Snape's office.

It was as dark and dingy a place as Harry remembered. The only noticeable difference was that Snape had acquired several more jars over the summer, each of them filled with a new slimy something Harry did not recognize.

"It is your lucky day, Potter."

*It doesn't feel like it right now.* Surely Snape would only ever say that to mock him. "What do you mean, Professor?"

Snape screwed up his face. *It's like he's trying not to curse me.* "You are an exceptional student --- exceptional enough that you are being bestowed a unique honour." His lip curled. "I personally consider this madness and think it will only inflate your ego further, but choices like these are beyond my authority."

*He's really not happy.* "What honour, sir?"

The professor waved his wand and a desk drawer slid open. Snape withdrew an odd device Harry had never seen before ---something resembling an hourglass hanging from an ornate chain. *It's mechanical though, or something like it. Weird.*

"Do you know what this is, Potter?"

"No, sir."

"This is a time turner. Its function is as advertised. Anyone in possession of this device or any like it will have, at their disposal, a mechanism capable of traversing time itself."

Awe washed over him, all semblances of Occlumency forgotten. "Sir, are you telling me this lets whoever's wearing it travel through time?"

"In a sense." *He really doesn't sound happy. Not that I can blame him --- why would anyone give these to a student?*

"Sir, do I understand right that you're going to give this to me?" Snape nodded curtly. "Why do Hogwarts students get time turners? That seems mental."

Snape's lip curled. "I'm glad to see there is still some sense left in that overinflated head of yours. Rest assured, Potter, that these are not given out lightly. You are one of two Hogwarts students this year being given one. You two will be the first students ever given these devices."

"Ever, sir?"

"Yes, Potter, ever; must I repeat myself so often?"

Harry grasped for control of his mind. *Must you be such an utter twat?* "Sorry, sir, it's just... a lot."

"These are a relatively new discovery made by the Department of Mysteries. There have been several propositions made over the past number of years for Hogwarts students to receive them, but they have all been denied." Snape looked like he was chewing on a lemon. "The Granger girl was granted one this year on the account of her wishing to take extra classes. She was deemed an exceptional student and served as an ideal opportunity for these devices to be tested in an educational setting. I was... displeased by the development."

"Because you don't think students should be given time turners?"

"I am quite correct in saying they should not be, but the bulk of my displeasure came when I heard who would be receiving one." Snape fixed him with his dark-eyed stare. "You are an attention-seeking brat completely lacking in common sense and void of any survival instincts, but it is you who stands atop your year, not Granger."

*So that's why he agreed. He can't stand Gryffindor winning, even if I gain from them not. It's so petty*, he almost laughed.

Snape lifted the time turner, but his grip around its chain remained firm. "It should go without saying that you will be monitored more closely than usual and questioned regularly about your usage of this."

Harry nodded, mind racing with a hundred new prospects. *I can really do it. Between this and Grindelwald, I can work towards being free.* "Yes, sir."

"The time turner may not be used to retake tests or exams, nor in any competitive environment such as Quidditch. If you leave the castle during the spring or winter breaks, the time turner will remain behind with me." Snape stared into his eyes. "Am I understood?"

Harry nodded. "Yes, sir."

"I should dissuade any delusions you may have about bending time to your whims before you try something foolish. The time turner works safely only in one-hour increments. One full turn of the hourglass will transport you back one hour into the past, and back is the only direction you can travel." Harry nodded to show that he was following.

"I am legally bound to inform you that this device should only be used in order to attend extra classes and complete the necessary course material," Snape's lip curled again, "but I am not foolish enough to believe you will follow such restrictions. Instead I will tell you that those who meddle with time rarely find kind fates. No one has travelled further back than six hours. Seven is theoretically possible, but you would be a greater fool than even your father if you tried."

"So only go back a few hours at a time, at most?"

"At most. This is not a toy, Potter, and it has other consequences."

*Here comes the catch.* "What sorts of consequences, Professor?"

"The time turner allows you to be in two places simultaneously. If you travel back in time, two of you will exist before the past version of yourself takes the time turner back, as you did."

Harry swallowed hard. *This sounds like one of Dudley's cartoons.* "I'm guessing I probably don't want to run into the duplicate of myself?"

"Doing so would be ill-thought. You should also avoid others realizing there are two of you. No one is to know of this, not even your closest friends."

*It's weird agreeing with Snape, but he's right about that part. Draco would probably go run his mouth about it.* "I understand."

"There is more than the possibility of colliding with an alternative version of yourself. The time turner does not duplicate you. It instead divides, leaving your mind and body reeling under twice the strain. This is the price you pay for time."

*That could be a problem.*

"I'm warning you, Potter, misuse of this device will be severely punished."

Harry nodded one last time, reaching out as Snape finally handed him the time turner, its metal cold against his skin. "I understand, sir."

***That evening...***

Hermione's eyelids drooped, the scarlet curtains flickering in and out of sight as she scratched Crookshanks behind the ear. Her head lulled and the necklace swung, its metal cold against her skin.

That was what jolted her. She cupped the hourglass and held it up to her face, staring down and battling the storm raging inside her.

*This is stupid! This is so stupid! Why is everything in this world stupid!* The Philosopher's Stone left in a school, aurors uninvolved in fighting threats against children, dementors at Hogwarts, and now this? *How am I ever supposed to be comfortable in a world that makes no sense? Everything is broken!*

Hardly anything worked the way it should. Couldn't they all see that? Couldn't the adults do something about it? Almost everything needed fixing and the world would operate a whole lot smoother if people just slowed down and used basic common sense.

But on the other hand...

A time turner, resting in the palm of her hand. *I can do things with this... so much is possible.* She almost gasped, struck by sudden inspiration. *This is it! This is my chance! I can use this. I'll use it to get ahead --- so far ahead that, by the time I graduate, they'll have to listen*. There was hope yet --- if no one else would fix things, then Hermione would do it herself.

***September 3, 1993***

***The Headmaster's Office***

***8:00 PM***

Harry examined his own emotions as he climbed the spiral staircase. Pleasant memories came with this climb, but so too did knowing long-buried secrets. *Why does what he did that summer bug me more than what Grindelwald did?* It all came back to treachery. *Dumbledore was willing to leave his family... I could never do that.*

"Enter," Dumbledore called once Harry knocked upon his door. The office remained unchanged but for the headmaster's desk, upon which lay the largest pile of parchment Harry had ever seen .

"Busy start to your year, sir?" he asked, taking the seat across from Dumbledore.

Dumbledore shoved aside a sheet of parchment. "You could say that, yes. Dementors on the grounds of Hogwarts come with much paperwork. Funny that the one tasked with said work is the one who opposed their presence from the beginning."

"My friends said you wouldn't like dementors at Hogwarts. They were surprised to see them here at all."

A shadow passed across Dumbledore's face. "They were correct. I have no love for beasts who know nothing but treachery and despair. Cornelius\'s assurances do little to appease me."

"Do you think the dementors are working with Black, or something?"

The headmaster's lips thinned. "No. The dementors will not spare Sirius Black, not now that he has escaped. I doubt even Lord Voldemort could convince them otherwise."

*Careful with this next one.* "But you think Voldemort is coming back?"

Dumbledore looked old all of a sudden. "I believe that his return is inevitable, whenever it may come." He peered out his office window towards the clear night sky. "I fear that day of reckoning may not be so distant. There have been rumblings."

*Dumbledore really doesn't miss much.* Harry hoped he remained ignorant. Things could get very complicated if Dumbledore learned of Voldemort's return. *Caught between the two most powerful wizards in the world... that doesn't sound fun.*

"I believe that's enough talk of dementors and Voldemort," Dumbledore decided. "We have much to discuss. How has your return to classes treated you?"

"We haven't done much except for Divination and Care of Magical Creatures yesterday, plus a double period in Potions earlier today."

"What do you think of your new classes? I heard that Silvanus began his class this year with hippogriffs; such beautiful creatures, they are."

Harry smiled in memory. "It was my favourite class so far. Crabbe thought he might be starting us too fast, but it all worked out."

"Professor Kettleburn has always been fond of grand beginnings. I eagerly await the stories of each new year. What of the others?"

Harry chewed his lip. "I don't know about Divination." That was a lie. *I know it's a complete and total waste of time with that idiot teaching.* All she had done was predict his death by staring into some tea leaves. *Even Grindelwald thinks she's a joke.*

"It has never been my favourite subject." Harry remembered Dumbledore saying that while talking with Grindelwald and suppressed a shudder. "Not many have the gift. Do not take any failures too harshly, and do try and forgive Sybil's eccentricities. She is a kind-hearted woman who means well."

"Yes, sir." There was nothing else to say. *I'll just keep my insults nonverbal.*

"Divination took place during the same time as Arithmancy yesterday, did it not?" Harry nodded. "So you have used the time turner?"

"I did. It was... weird."

"Is it true that those who use them feel no connection to their alternative self?"

"If Snape hadn't told me how it worked---"

"Professor Snape, Harry."

Harry's eye twitched, but went on. "If Professor Snape hadn't told me how it worked, I would never have realized there was another one of me at all." A grimace marred his face. "Until that night. I crashed really hard."

Dumbledore nodded. "That is unsurprising. Professor Snape and I are of the belief that Occlumency can be used to augment your mind in a way that may lessen the strain it undergoes."

"Thought streams, right?"

"Your knowledge has expanded since last we met."

Harry wanted to curse the moment the question left his lips. *Idiot! Voldemort is the one who mentioned that!* "I read about them this summer. There are a few books on it in the Black family library."

"I see." Harry tried gauging Dumbledore's mood, but it was impossible. "I should have known curiosity would get the best of you. Your Occlumency is impressive for one so young. You continued the prescribed exercises over the summer?"

"Yes, sir. They've been helping; I can feel the difference."

"Good. I will no longer keep Passive Occlumency from you, but I do ask that attempted alterations of your own mind be done only while instructed and supervised until you have a grasp on the necessary concepts."

Harry fought a smile. *I'll have supervision, it might just not be what you have in mind.* "Of course, sir."

"I was referring to thought streams, as you guessed. They are, at first, exhausting, but become much less so with time. We believe their usage may reduce the strain caused by the time turner."

"So are we going to test the theory?"

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "You will be testing it later this year so long as you gain proficiency with the technique, though I am afraid I will not be aiding you."

Harry frowned. "But you just asked me not to do those sorts of things without proper instruction."

"And you will have it, just not from me. I will be passing the duty of teaching you Occlumency onto Professor Snape this year."

Harry stiffened. "What? But, sir---"

Dumbledore held up a hand. "Please let me explain." Harry reluctantly sat back in his chair. "Professor Snape is more gifted an occlumens than I will ever be. I feared him too impatient to instruct a beginner, but you are past that stage now. I believe he will be a better instructor than I. It would be selfish of me not to do what I feel is best for you."

"What if I'd still prefer you teach me? Headmaster, you must know that he and I don't get along."

"I am not unaware. It is another reason why I believe this to be wise."

Harry chose his next words carefully. "Sir, I don't mean to be rude, but that sounds completely backwards."

"Does it? We have already discussed Voldemort's inevitable return. Both you and Professor Snape have strong reasons to oppose him. Is it not wise ensuring the two of you can coexist before that trying day comes?"

Guilt clawed at his stomach, but he batted it away. *You're doing what's best for you. That's it. There's nothing wrong with that.* "I guess so, sir."

"Fear not, I won't neglect you this year. We will continue our lessons, they will simply cease being focused on Occlumency."

Harry perked back up. "What will you be teaching me, sir?"

"It is my hope that I will teach you how better to handle yourself in the event that Sirius Black or similarly interested parties gain access to you."

Harry's eyes lit up. "You're going to teach me how to fight?"

"Slowly but surely. We will begin with me teaching you Transfiguration and see how much of the curriculum we can get through. I believe you are ahead already?"

Harry nodded. "I'm probably somewhere into the fourth-year curriculum. I haven't pushed myself as hard in Transfiguration as I have in something like Defence Against the Dark Arts."

"All the better. All it means is that you do not yet understand your potential. I think you will soon surprise yourself."

**Author's Endnote:**

**I can see you all typing away about how foolish it is to include time turners and I understand your concern. They are beyond broken canonically. That is one of the reasons I am including them --- I want to see if I can provide at least a little bit of balance and logic to something so broken. You can see the foundations of that balance in this chapter already. I will promise right now that time turners will not become a major plot device, and that you will not see any moments of import suddenly undone. Their inclusion is a personal challenge to myself; that's really about it.**

**I should also point out that, due to his year-long stay in Azkaban, Hagrid did not get the Care of Magical Creatures position. There's no good way of explaining that in-world since, from the characters' perspectives, him not getting it is normal so they have no reason to ponder it.**

***September 6, 1993***

***The Great Hall***

***12:11 PM***

Harry felt energized at lunch when he entered the Great Hall flanked by Theodore and Pansy. Their last lesson before lunch had been Charms and Harry had stayed behind to ask some more advanced questions. Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle had gone on ahead, but Theodore and Pansy had waited.

Harry and the others had entered that morning to find a blazing sun smiling down at them from the enchanted ceiling far above. It was the first bit of sun any of them had seen since their arrival at Hogwarts. Harry had heard some students muttering about how the dementors had brought with them a perpetual downpour of rain and gloom.

Between the bright weather and their last Charms lesson, Harry was feeling better than he had in days. Flitwick was one of the first professors to let them cast magic instead of slogging through reviews of last year's curriculum, or in the case of Harry's new classes, teaching the basics.

*Or doing whatever the hell Trelawney's doing. What a waste of time. I'd feel cheated if I didn't get a time turner...* Snape had wanted him to take all the classes, but he had refused to sit through Muggle Studies. They had argued, but Harry had won. His four classes were still impossible without the time turner, so there hadn't been much Snape could say. *Guess it means I can't drop Divination, though. Pity.*

Harry's eyes sought out Granger. She was sitting with Weasley and looked unchanged. *Figures, the year's barely started.* It would be interesting to watch the strain on her this year. *She's taking more classes than me and probably doesn't know Occlumency. We'll see how worth it these time turners are.*

"What took you so long?" Draco asked once Harry took his seat.

"I was just asking Flitwick something about a spell we'll learn later this year."

"What was it?"

Harry frowned. *Weird, Draco's never been interested in this stuff.* "I know we'll learn the Cheering Charm this year, so I asked if there was a spell that did the opposite. I think it was the dementors that made me think of it."

Draco pushed away his half-eaten plate. "And what did he say?"

"He said we won't be learning any charms like that."

Draco scowled. "So he didn't answer the question."

"Not really, but I bet there is. He would have just said no if not."

"There is," Theodore said quietly. "It's a curse, not a charm. I'm not surprised Flitwick didn't tell you."

"How do you know that?" Draco asked, his scowl deepening.

Theodore looked around, ensuring others were occupied in their own discussions. "I don't know the incantation or what it's actually called, but Father's always called it the Suicide Curse." Hairs stood up on the back of Harry's neck. *This sounds lovely...* "Grindelwald made it famous in the twenties and thirties. It's how he got rid of a bunch of high-ranking officials who opposed him."

Harry kept his composure, but barely. *Why does that surprise me? Why does every awful thing I hear about Grindelwald surprise me?* Was it because of seeing his past? Had Harry grown too close to him? Had he begun overlooking everything he had done? *I'll get more context soon; he'll definitely show me stuff from the war.*

Draco twirled a fork between his fingers. "I've never heard of it."

"I'm not surprised. I don't recall you having ancestors who fought on Grindelwald's side."

Harry nearly dropped his own fork. *The Notts fought for Grindelwald? Why?* They were among the harshest blood supremacists in Britain and Grindelwald viewed all magicians as equals. *They must have seen an advantage in it somewhere. I'll ask Grindelwald about it; that and the Suicide Curse.*

"If you're all quite finished," said Pansy, sliding back into her spot beside Harry, who blinked; he hadn't realised she had left. "I have gossip."

Draco rolled his eyes. "You always have gossip. No offence, but I personally don't care who was caught in a broom cupboard by the patrols last night."

Pansy sneered at him. "I'll have you know that no one was caught last night, thank you very much, and that this gossip is more up your alley."

"Go on, then," Draco said with a long, suffering sigh. Harry bit his tongue. *He really is a jerk to Pansy. I know he's joking a lot of the time, but he never shuts up.*

"We're going to be fighting boggarts today."

Draco really did drop his fork and Theodore nearly cut himself with the knife he was holding. "What?" he asked, putting the knife aside.

"That's what Lupin has done so far with all the third years. We have his class today, don't we?"

"Right after lunch," Harry confirmed, mind racing.

"A boggart?" Theodore asked, casting his eyes about the Great Hall. *It's like he's looking for a way out.* "Is he mad?"

"He's something," sneered Draco. "I doubt anyone who dresses like that can be sensible."

Harry looked away, remembering the rags he'd worn on Privet Drive. *No. That's over, you're never going back. Think about other things.* The first thing he thought about was fighting a boggart; that was hardly any better.

"How's it going to work?" Theodore asked Pansy. "Are we going to wait out in the hall or something while one of us fights the boggart at a time?"

Pansy chewed her lip. "The others all fought the boggart in the same room, one after the other. They're all talking about each others' fears."

Harry imitated Draco in sneering. *Bloody hell, he really is mad.*

***About an hour later, in the Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom...***

Lupin's classroom was more like Aberforth's than Quirrell's. The walls were bare and his desk was empty but for a stack of parchment. The curtains were pulled back and sunlight spilled through the large glass windows, leaving bright pools on the otherwise empty walls.

Lupin shuffled some parchment then set it down atop his desk. Draco had a point; never had Harry seen a professor look so unfit for the job. His robes were tattered and fraying at the edges, all colour long lost from them. His skin was thin and pale, his hair patched and greying.

Lupin had hardly finished taking the roll when Theodore's hand went up. Lupin raised an eyebrow and pointed to him. "I've heard a rumour that you plan to have us face a boggart."

The professor furrowed his brow. "Whoever passed it along is well-informed."

"So it's true?"

"That's the plan for today, yes."

"Isn't that unsafe?" Greengrass asked.

*Here we go.* Harry sat back and watched. Lupin frowned. "Unsafe?"

"Being thrown at a boggart just seems extreme. What happens if someone reacts poorly? What happens if the experience leads to trauma?"

Harry resisted the urge to glare. *Why must I agree with her? Why can't she just be wrong for once in her life?*

Lupin looked unperturbed. "Boggarts can elicit some strong reactions, but that's exactly why I think it's important to cover them."

Greengrass chewed her lip. "That sounds somewhat counterintuitive, Professor."

"Does it? I would think you'd rather first meet a boggart in a classroom than at random whilst unprepared." Greengrass had no answer for that. "Are there any other objections?"

"I heard you made the others face the boggart in front of the class," said Theodore.

Lupin's lips thinned. "I did."

"I won't do that."

The professor shrugged. "I can't force you to. You may leave if you'd like, but it will be covered on the end-of-year exam and you may want the preparation."

"You really mean to have us face our darkest fears in front of the entire class?" Draco asked with his trademark sneer. "Do you realize how dimwitted that is?"

Lupin appeared frustrated now, fingering the tears along the edges of his robe. "Have you ever thought to consider that I might have my own reasons for overlooking those risks?"

"Did you ever stop to consider that some of us may actually have gone through traumatic experiences we don't want others knowing about?" Greengrass asked.

"I will not have any of you face a boggart alone." Lupin's tone became sharp for the first time. "I understand why some of you may be concerned, but this is the only way I feel comfortable conducting this lesson.

"The more of you there are on hand, the more confused the boggart will be." Greengrass backed down again. Draco muttered something about his father under his breath. "Tell him if you wish," said Lupin, "I'm sure he knows that boggarts rarely take the forms of more serious fears." Harry blinked. *How the hell did he hear that?*

"What do you mean?" Greengrass asked.

"Boggarts become a manifestation of fear, but not always the fear itself. It's easy for a boggart to become a spider when faced with someone who's arachnophobic. It's harder for a boggart to match deeper fears like failure because that doesn't have a single form. I think some of you might be surprised at how little your boggarts actually give away."

Lupin offered them all one final chance to leave. When no one took it, he led them into the staff room. It was large, dark with its curtains drawn and empty but for the class and a cabinet that rattled violently when they entered.

Harry eyed the cabinet. *What is my boggart*? The question had plagued him since lunch, but he had no answers.

Years ago it would have been Vernon, but he was past that now. Many children may fear Voldemort, but Harry knew his boggart would not be the Dark Lord. *Wylla Nurmen, maybe? That feels more like what it would have been last year.*

Harry still had no inkling by the time Millicent Bulstrode faced the boggart. It became a bloodless corpse, its eyes dark, chalk-white hands outstretched. Davis's boggart was a pair of dead bodies belonging to two people who could only be her parents, whilst Moon's became a rabid werewolf.

Harry was beginning to realize by the time the first of his friends moved forward that he would face the boggart unaware. *It doesn't matter; I got* *through Privet Drive, this will be nothing.*

Harry had just enough time to see crimson eyes frame a snake-like face before Lupin stepped in front of Goyle and the boggart became something round and silver. *The moon? Why would he be afraid of the moon*. The better question was why Goyle would be afraid of Voldemort. *I expected people would, but not purebloods whose parents were probably Death Eaters.*

The line of students thinned. Pansy's boggart was tame after Goyle's --- herself, but skeletally thin and wearing robes that made Lupin look well-dressed. Zabini was next, faced with the corpse of a beautiful woman.

Theodore hid a snicker. "The Black Widow's son is afraid of his mother's death? How ironic."

Crabbe's boggart was taller and bulkier than he was, but it resembled him so closely that Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was afraid of himself. Then he realized it must be his father. He made fists so tight that his nails bit at his palms.

This he could empathize with. *It would have been my guardians if we did this two years ago*. A sick part of him was glad, not for Crabbe's pain, but for his own empathy. *I'm changing, but not in bad ways. I can still feel sorry for people --- Grindelwald isn't brainwashing me, or anything.*

Crabbe's hand shook so violently that his wand looked fit to fall from loosely clutching fingers. *It's like when the dementor walked in.* Harry wondered how many dementors Lupin had seen in these lessons. *Not that it will be mine... that whole thing still makes no sense.*

"Next!" Lupin called, realizing Crabbe's plight. Harry stepped forward, but Draco was faster. His legs trembled, but his head remained high. *His might be a dementor,* Harry thought, but then dismissed it. *Probably upsetting his father, or something.*

The boggart was at least as tall as Lucius, but its hair and eyes were too dark, its skin too pale.

Harry restrained a gasp --- Draco's boggart was Tom Riddle.

Draco's arm halted, his wand half-raised. Riddle smiled, holding up his hand. A ring gleamed on his finger, etched with something Harry could not read, blinded by torchlight sparkling off a deep, green emerald.

"RIDDIKULUS!" Blue flashed so brightly that, for a moment, Harry could see nothing at all. When it faded, Riddle remained, kneeling at Draco's feet with his head bowed and wearing house-elf garb.

*Riddle... Draco's afraid of Riddle*. What did that mean? Was it just because of how close they'd come to death, or was there more?

*"Boggarts become a manifestation of fear, but not always the fear itself. It's easy for a boggart to become a spider when faced with someone who's arachnophobic. It's harder for a boggart to match deeper fears like failure because that doesn't have a single form. I think some of you might be surprised at how little your boggarts give away."*

*It could mean a hundred things.*

Harry leant forward when Greengrass faced the boggart. It still sickened him just looking at her. If the last year had taught him anything, it was how much he loathed treachery. *Not to mention she tried killing me... I'll get her for that.*

A young girl screamed, pulling out clumps of brown hair whilst her face twisted in agony. Greengrass waved her wand and there was a flash of blue light, then the girl was smiling, the light of laughter in her eyes. *She looks familiar.*

"Her sister," Pansy whispered in his ear. She had come back around after facing her boggart.

Harry could have smacked himself. That was where he had seen her. *So what? She's afraid of her sister being in pain?* Something told him that was wrong and that this was another less literal boggart. *She didn't want me seeing it, that must be why she pressed Lupin so hard.* A smile split his face. *That's it, that's how I get back at her.* It would need more thought. *I won't hurt a little girl, but there must be another way.*

Theodore moved towards the boggart, his footsteps echoing in the otherwise silent room. He was the final student in line aside from Harry. *What is his boggart? He looks awful.*

The boggart changed. Hovering just feet from Theodore was a green skull from whose mouth protruded a serpent --- Theodore's worst fear was the Dark Mark.

*Why? His father's a Death Eater, he admitted it himself. That makes no sense.*

The dark mark contorted and became discoloured until it was a pale cloud drifting through the dark staff room.

Harry drew his wand. *Let's see what it is, then.*

Lupin stepped between him and the cloud. There was a flash of blue light, then the boggart was gone. "It seems that I've misjudged the time," the professor said, his smile strained. "You all did excellent. There will be no homework today."

Harry felt the stares on his back when they left the room. *Let them stare.* Lupin must have thought his boggart would be Voldemort given his past. Not facing it would make the exam more difficult, but he hardly minded. Seeing the livid look on Greengrass's face when the lesson ended was worth it.

*How does it feel when things don't go your way, Greengrass?* Curiosity gnawed at him despite the victory. *I wonder what it would have been.*

***September 9, 1993***

***The Headmaster's Office***

***8:30 PM***

Ron looked around the circular room, hardly believing he was here. *I doubt even Fred and George have been here*. Percy --- perfect, Head Boy Percy --- probably had been, but it was something to rub in the twins' faces later.

A soft squawk drew Ron's attention. He actually jumped when he saw the phoenix lift its head.

Dumbledore chuckled from behind his desk. "Fawkes inspires the most delightful reactions."

Ron blushed furiously. "I thought he was a statue," he mumbled. The bird had been soundless and sleeping not a heartbeat before.

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "That is certainly a first. Thank you for bringing me something unique. I'm so rarely surprised in my old age --- and when I am, the surprise is usually of the unpleasant variety."

Ron grasped for words. "Uh... you're welcome, sir."

"I think we have talked enough about birds and surprises. Come, take a seat." Ron obliged him, suddenly wary. *What does he want? I haven't done anything.*

"You aren't in trouble," Dumbledore said as if reading his mind. "Quite the opposite."

*Huh?* "The opposite?"

"Quite. I have heard some worrying third-hand accounts involving you and wanted to ask after you."

Ron screwed up his face and thought. The answer came fast. "Lupin told you?" he asked. "He said he wouldn't, he swore no one else..." Ron trailed off when Dumbledore raised a hand for silence.

"It is Professor Lupin. Always address people by their correct names, Master Weasley."

Ron's blush returned. "Sorry."

"It is a lesson many young people must learn; you are not the first and you will not be the last. You can take solace in knowing that Professor Lupin did not tell me about the events of your first practical lesson in Defence Against the Dark Arts."

Ron wracked his brain, trying to think of who may have told Dumbledore. The possibilities were disturbingly numerous. Most of Gryffindor House had been talking about it, sans a few girls who mocked Hermione for her boggart --- herself, puffy-eyed and dressed in tattered robes. That had confused Ron. She said it had nothing to do with being poor but wouldn't explain. *Girls.*

Not that he could judge anyone --- his boggart had reminded him of that in the most painful way possible.

***Earlier that week...***

Ron wondered, not for the first time, what it meant to be brave. Gryffindors were supposed to be bold and courageous, but his knees were shaking and he felt anything but brave.

Thinking about what was coming just made it worse. That horrible cold, those rattling breaths, that slimy grey hand that had protruded from the monster's sleeve...

The boggart began changing and Ron readied himself. *How the hell do I make a dementor funny? I'm not ready! I...*

Someone screamed. Hermione stared up at him through lifeless eyes. Ron stared back, his jaw agape. The front of her robes were drenched in blood, its crimson fingers reaching out across the floor. The wound was in her chest --- a gaping, sword-shaped wound that had already killed her. *Just like it killed Luna... just like I killed Luna...*

Ron gasped for air. It felt like he was flailing beneath icy water while he tried gathering his thoughts. *It's not real! It's not real! It's not real!*

How could one find humour in death? How could anyone think of something to laugh at whilst staring their greatest failure in its lifeless face? Ron's lips moved, but no words came out. His arm began dropping, the room spun past him, torches whirling past his eyes.

"Riddikulus."

Ron stumbled back from the flash of blue light only to find that Lupin had stepped between him and the boggart and was now forcing it back into the cabinet.

The fear was gone, but there was no relief. Ron thought he would rather face the boggart ten more times than feel how he felt now. Nothing was worse than knowing he had failed again.

***Back in the present...***

"I see that you're confused," said Dumbledore, bringing Ron's attention back to the present. "There is no need for you to puzzle out the truth, I intend to tell it to you."

Ron blinked. "You do?"

Dumbledore smiled. "I can hardly expect you to be honest if I myself sit across from you on a throne made from secrets."

Fawkes let out a trill that clawed at Ron's heart. It was cold and unlike the music felt down in the Chamber of Secrets. Guilt twisted at his stomach, but there was nothing to be guilty for. "What was that?"

Dumbledore looked ten years older. "A reminder."

*Barmy, he is. Brilliant, but barmy. "*I, uh, don't mean to be rude, but why am I here?"

"Ah yes, we have strayed from the topic at hand. My apologies. I have never been good at staying topical." Dumbledore slid his half-moon spectacles down his nose and peered at Ron. "I was told about your boggart by Professor McGonagall, who was in turn told by Miss Granger."

Ron jolted. "Hermione?"

"She worries for you. Most children your age fear mundane things they may one day grow out of. What that boggart became is something darker, the root of scars that may never heal. Miss Granger was right to worry."

"So what?" Ron asked, his hands moving restlessly in his lap. "Are you gonna ask me what it means or something?"

"Heavens no. I can guess what it means, but my interpretation matters little and it is not my place to ask such questions. I will listen and offer advice if you ask for it, but I will not press you. I want only to know how you're handling the events of the past two years." His expression soured. "I ought to have had this talk with you long ago. You have my sincerest apologies for overlooking the traumatic end of your first year. That was callous of me."

Ron had been unprepared for this. *What am I supposed to say?* Dumbledore was a mythical figure like Circe or Merlin. "Thanks, sir, but I don't think there's anything you can do. It's just... hard."

"May I ask a potentially invasive question that you are under no obligation to answer?" Ron nodded; what else was he going to do? "What is it that troubles you most?"

Ron's answer was immediate and painful. "That I could have saved them."

Dumbledore closed his eyes; he looked even older now. "You could not have saved them."

"Maybe not Neville," Ron admitted, remembering the true tale of his old friend's death --- a tale that Dumbledore thought he knew not. "I could have saved Luna, though."

Dumbledore opened his eyes; they were wet and filled with sadness. "I was not in the Chamber of Secrets, so I will not argue. I will say only this. Those who experience loss often wonder what they could have done. Your mind might conjure a hundred ideas, but they are nothing more than dreams. Anyone who is good and kind must know they did all they could. It is hard, but necessary. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live."

*This is why Dumbledore's so great.* He was wiser than any man Ron had ever known. *I'd be dumb not to ask while I'm here.* "What would you do if you were me?"

"I would not dwell on those dreams, but I would hold onto them and remember what the lost meant to me. Think of them during times of need and continue forward. Light can be found even in the darkest of places. Remember that, Ronald, it is of the utmost importance."

***Meanwhile, in the dungeons...***

Tonight was Harry's first Occlumency lesson with Snape and he couldn't quite decide how he felt. Harry was ready to endure the worst Snape had to offer, but still he was excited. The prospect of reduced strain was becoming more welcome with each passing day --- a night had yet to pass without Harry completely crashing.

Someone moved behind him and Harry turned, wand raised and ready for Greengrass, one of her plans, or even Sirius Black.

"I should probably have warned you I was coming up behind you."

Harry glared at Theodore. "Do that next time."

"I'll keep it in mind." The pair fell into step together. "Where are you off to?"

A sigh escaped his lips. "Snape's office."

"Lucky you."

Harry grimaced. "I'm supposed to learn something interesting, but we'll see."

The two plunged deeper into the dungeons, nearing the dark room Snape called his office. Harry waited. Theodore was pondering something and would speak when he was ready; Harry knew that about him by now.

"Why did Lupin stop you from facing the boggart?"

Harry took a few more steps before he answered. "He never told me."

"But you know, don't you?"

Harry mussed his hair. "I think he expected it to be the Dark Lord."

Silence hung between them. "Would it have been?"

Harry cast a handful of detection charms under his breath, but they were alone. "You think I would have accepted a truce if I was that afraid?"

Theodore shrugged. "It would be a good way to stay safe."

"It would be a good way to get betrayed." Harry forced himself not to shudder. "I guess that might still happen, but here's hoping." *I just need to buy time. One day, I'll be strong.*

Theodore shook his head. "The Dark Lord would be mad to betray you. He understands what kind of ally you could be."

*Do you understand that, Theodore?* Harry wondered. *Is that why you've been so involved lately*? Things had begun adding up. First the book of Nott family magic, then continuously choosing him in small ways over Draco, then his attentiveness to the smallest of Harry's needs.

Harry rid himself of those thoughts. *Don't be so paranoid, you're friends.* "What about yours?" he asked.

"My what?"

"Your boggart. It was the Dark Mark, but I don't understand why."

Theodore's next step was awkward and he nearly stumbled. "The Dark Lord... wasn't pleased with those who used the Imperius Defence," he said. "He saw it as a sign of disloyalty. I still worry that he might snap at Father."

*Liar.* Harry knew not why he was so sure, but he was. *There's something more he isn't telling me.* There was no point in prying; Theodore would reveal no more than he had already. *Add it to the list*, he thought, remembering the other fears he would be investigating.

***September 15, 1993***

***The Ancient Runes Classroom***

***5:30 PM***

Hermione strained to watch him through the crowd, marked by a head of unruly black hair. A first year squeaked when she shoved him roughly aside, but she paid him no heed. "Potter!"

His steps stuttered and he glanced over his shoulder, fingers flexing. "Granger?"

"Can I have a word?"

Surprise passed across his face, but not for long. "Sure. Follow me."

They wove through the bustling crowd on its way down to dinner and around the next bend, through a tapestry Hermione had never noticed and into a secret passageway hidden behind it. The crowd's bustling was still audible, but muffled by the walls and tapestry.

"This good enough?" She nodded. "All right, then. What was it you wanted?"

Hermione reached beneath the collar of her robes and withdrew the golden hourglass. "You have one of these." It was not a question.

She waited for him to fidget, but instead he smiled. "Caught on, have you?"

She narrowed her eyes. *Is he mocking me? I can't tell.* "I noticed the first week, but wanted to be sure." She crossed her arms, frustration mounting when his smile turned anger. Her cheeks flushed with sudden knowing."You knew I had one!"

His smile faltered. Now he ran a hand through his hair, finally discomforted. *Good.* "Snape told me the day I got mine."

*That's horribly unfair!* Professor McGonagall had made no mention of another time turner inside Hogwarts. She scowled; it was just another example of Snape's blatant favouritism.

Her scowl deepened. "How do you look so calm? This is insane!"

His expression smoothed. "Yeah," he admitted, shifting from foot to foot. "That's about what I thought when Snape gave me the time turner."

"That's it? You just thought it was insane and moved on?"

His look made her eye twitch, the look of someone inspecting a slow child. "Granger, what else was I supposed to do? I wasn't going to complain and give it back."

"It doesn't bother you that they'll just give these out to children?" She placed her hands on her hips, glaring slightly up at him. "What about the dementors, or the blood supremacy, or everything else wrong?"

His face twitched but he hid his thoughts well. *Too well,* she thought, resisting a shiver. *That's not natural.*

"It bothers me," he admitted. "Less the time turners and more some of the other things, but we're students. We can't do anything yet."

Her heart quickened, visions of change swimming behind her eyes. "Do you think things can be changed? Do you think people like us can make this world make any sense?"

Potter appeared to chew his words, his face void of all emotion. "There are always ways to change things, but they're usually messy."

**Book 3: The Looming of Shadows**

**Chapter 11: Looming Clouds**

***September 2, 1899***

***Cairo, Egypt***

***8:33 PM***

Gellert appeared surrounded by sprawling sands and blood-red skies. The air was thick and humid, but the burning heat was retreating with the slowly setting sun. Long shadows lounged in the sand as the sun neared the horizon, making the few buildings Gellert could see far off in the distance look like shadowed peaks rising up to hide the glowing star.

Gellert glared up at the sky. Anything resembling blood would set him off. Blood was what he should have shed two weeks ago. *It will be worse now.*

He had fled England following his duel with Albus and slunk around the German countryside whilst deciding where next to go. That part of his plan remained unchanged. *I must be prepared, both for Albus and for conquest. I cannot fail, the greater good dies with me.*

It would be better once that final battle came. *It will be kinder. Albus will no longer wonder and the world will be rebuilt. All I must do is win.*

Gellert recalled the duel for what must have been the thousandth time. His findings were the same. *Albus was more skillful.* Gellert had been more seasoned and a better traditional duellist, but Albus's control over elaborate magic was something Gellert had never seen. *And there is Drochuisc. How did he come to know it?*

It mattered not. They would fight again and experience would no longer be on his side. Age would even out that field. *I must win in other ways, learn magics beyond imagination and come armed with the ultimate weapon*.

That journey started here, amidst what remained of a once-great empire. *No stone will remain unturned. I must win. Everything depends on that victory.*

"Did you really believe you'd win?" Harry asked once the familiar cell came into focus.

Grindelwald's expression remained smooth and unreadable. "Why do you ask this? You experienced my thoughts as clearly as I once did. You know the answer."

"It just seems weird. You admitted to yourself that Dumbledore was more skilled and even that your only real advantage wouldn't matter by the time you fought again."

"One does not chase the things I sought without confidence. My doubts about beating Albus came mostly in those early days. I grew surer of the outcome as the years aged. You will understand this in time."

"But you were never positive. They say you never dared attack Britain so long as Dumbledore lived."

"I never feared Albus. I was wary of him, just as he was of me. You forget that he never pursued me in all the years I reigned. Not until inaction would have shamed him."

Harry frowned. "So both of you felt the same?"

"We knew better than any what we were capable of. I knew Albus had affinities I would never have and he knew the same. I knew that he had once been more skillful, whilst he had heard rumours that I possessed the very weapon we once sought as children."

"The Elder Wand?" Harry asked, suddenly breathless. "You actually found it?"

"It was my life's work," Grindelwald said as though it was the simplest thing in the world.

"Where is it?" Harry asked, eyes wide.

This was what he needed! If the tale was true, then this would be an unbeatable wand! Harry could take revenge against Black, establish himself in the wizarding world, and even match the likes of Voldemort.

"I am unsure what became of it."

Harry's stomach dropped. "Unsure?"

"It is difficult tracing an artifact most believe to be mythology whilst trapped in a cell."

"But Dumbledore would know, wouldn't he?"

Grindelwald's expression was unreadable. "Albus would never have claimed the wand."

"But you two---"

"Those discussions were the fantasies of children. Albus was always more interested in the stone. The wand would have repulsed him by the time we fought. I am sure he discarded it."

Harry's hands twitched. *That would be stupid.* "But wouldn't that be dangerous? That wand is supposed to be unbeatable."

"Yet Albus defeated me."

Harry frowned; his mind had skipped that detail. "How?"

"The wand does not make one invincible. Its long and bloody history speaks volumes of just how vulnerable one wielding it becomes."

"But you still wanted it."

"I was naïve. If I could do it all again, I would leave the wand untouched. I beg you not to make my old mistakes."

Harry nodded, but said nothing. *I never swore I would*. Whether Grindelwald had lost or not, the wand still sounded like just the thing he needed.

"I have something else to ask of you before I field more questions."

*Something to ask of me? He hardly ever asks things of me.* Harry's palms grew sweaty. "What is it?"

"Do not ask Albus about the wand. It would pain him. Let the matter lie."

Harry reluctantly nodded. *It's not like he would answer anyway*. "Can I ask other questions now?"

Grindelwald smiled thinly. "Of course."

"A friend of mine at school is named Theodore Nott. He said one of his ancestors worked with you."

"A Cantankerus Nott worked under me for a time."

Harry recognized the name. *Theodore's great grandfather; the one who wrote the Sacred Twenty-Eight*. "Theodore mentioned a spell a few days ago that you used to get rid of important people. He called it the Suicide Curse."

"Many did. The name was apt. I will show you my discovery of the spell soon. You may ask questions once I have."

Annoyance rose, but he forced it down and remained still. Arguing would not get him what he wanted. *Grindelwald's set in his ways, he won't change his plans for anything*.

"There was something else I wanted to ask you." Harry reached beneath the collar of his robes and brought out the time turner.

Grindelwald stared, leaning slowly forward. "So they have done it, then."

Harry could not help but be surprised. "You know what it is?" *Snape made it sound like a new invention.*

"I am educated enough to guess. Inquiries into the traversing of time are not a modern concept. None had succeeded by the time I was imprisoned. I presume that has changed."

"Yeah, this is called a time turner. It lets me travel a couple hours back in time."

Grindelwald's eyes had not left the time turner. "How did you acquire this?"

Harry nearly sneered --- the whole thing was still ridiculous. "The Ministry of Magic gave two to Hogwarts students to test them for education. We're not supposed to use them for anything other than extra classes and homework, but I don't think they have a way of monitoring us, really."

"And I presume that you will walk the logical path and take the fullest advantages afforded to you by your government's incompetence?"

"Once I figure out how." Harry ran a hand through his hair. "It's draining. It's like you're in two places at once any time you travel back in time. Your mind's working twice as hard and it catches up to you quickly."

Grindelwald drummed his fingers against his knee. "And you wish to ask if I have ideas on how this drain might be circumvented?"

"I've already been given a couple of ideas, but I need to learn Occlumency subskills that I know almost nothing about."

Grindelwald smiled. "Ah, yes. We shall begin immediately."

***September 24, 1993***

***The Great Hall***

***8:46 AM***

Harry noticed the tension hanging thickly in the air when he entered the Great Hall that morning. Whispers wafted from all four tables and hundreds of heads bent low. His own friends were tense when he approached. *Pansy isn't even looking at me. She usually can't stop staring*.

"Something's happened, hasn't it?"

"Black's been sighted here in the Highlands," Theodore admitted. The others shifted in their chairs --- Pansy even glared at Theodore like she wished he had never opened his mouth.

*They expect me to explode*. He reached for the paper, his expression blank.

***SIRIUS BLACK PLANNING AN ATTACK ON HOGWARTS?***

***By Rita Skeeter***

*Sirius Black is perhaps the most notorious prisoner Azkaban prison has ever housed. His dozen murders more than a decade ago were well-documented, as was his status as the lieutenant of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.*

*We all know who Sirius Black is and what he has done, but many of us allowed ourselves to forget about him until this summer, when his dark legacy was furthered by an impossible escape from Azkaban. In doing so, Black became the first prisoner ever to escape and started a nationwide manhunt that has thus far yielded no results.*

*Many witches and wizards all throughout the country have claimed sightings these past two months, but now, it seems that the Ministry of Magic have their first official lead.*

*Some in the community have suspected for some time that Sirius Black may target Hogwarts. It's only natural given his loyalty to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and the fact that his vanquisher dwells within the castle's walls. Some have gone as far as to say that Black's top priority is taking vengeance against Harry Potter for the events of October 31st, 1981, but others have been more skeptical.*

*Those skeptics are slowly losing ground after reports emerged claiming that Black has been sighted in a remote Scottish district and that a team of aurors was deployed to the area.*

*"We've thought for some time now that Black may be in Scotland," said the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge. "We've been prepared for this for some time. There's nothing to worry about."*

*When asked about the validity of this newest lead, Amelia Bones --- Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement --- admitted that this lead is one they are "taking special care to investigate thoroughly."*

The article continued with Skeeter speculating exactly how and when Black planned to strike. *Nothing but useless gossip*.

A fire burned inside him. His stomach ached from its heat. Its smoke coated his throat, choking him. *Calm down, this isn't the place*. He slowly brought his mind to heel. *Black will get his when I'm ready, I swear it.*

"Nothing surprising, really," Harry said, impressed by how calm he sounded. *I doubt my friends buy it, but I've probably disappointed a bunch of eavesdroppers.*

Theodore took back the paper. "The ministry was expecting this. They wouldn't have stuck a bunch of dementors here if they weren't."

"Here's hoping." Harry imagined a swarm of hooded figures descending on Black, imagined the laughter fading from his eyes, replaced by concern, then horror. *I can dream*.

Pansy cleared her throat. "If you boys are done dragging the mood down, I have gossip."

Draco's lip curled while both Crabbe and Goyle sighed. Theodore just rolled his eyes. Harry played along but secretly appreciated Pansy. *She's always been good at reading me and moving things along when they get tense*. He liked that about her; he had never considered how important it was until now.

"What is it this time?" Harry asked, exaggerating a sigh. "Has another couple gotten into the prefect's bathroom?"

"Nothing like that," she said with an evil-looking smile. She dropped her voice to a whisper. "It's about Daphne's sister."

Harry's interest leapt. He had meant to keep tabs on Astoria but had lacked the time. He had thought about the idea more. *She's afraid that I'll approach Astoria*. Between the boggart and the way she'd stared at him during her sister's sorting, it was the only logical answer. *She should have been less obvious*.

"Anything interesting?"

"She's having trouble in classes, but not in the normal way."

Theodore scowled. "Not in the normal way? What is this, a riddle? What are you on about?"

Pansy smirked. "Last week, the first years were learning the Lumos Charm and something went wrong."

"Wrong?" Draco asked. "What could possibly go wrong with a Lumos Charm?"

"She got the spell working, but it was apparently like lightning. The flash was so bright that a few firsties were sent to the hospital wing for headache cures and the person sitting across from her had to have their eyes looked over."

That was odd. *I guess her having trouble isn't that weird*. Daphne's brilliance had never extended to actually casting spells. *Nothing like that ever happened, though. I don't even know how that's possible*. Harry looked down the table and thought he saw her, but it was hard to tell; she was small and surrounded by larger students.

"That's not all," said Pansy. "Flitwick worked with her all of their next lesson and they couldn't get anything different to happen. It just flashed super bright every time."

*That makes even less sense*. A one-off outburst was one thing, but this was something different. *I'll have to ask Grindelwald about it*. He considered what Grindelwald might have done in his place. *He wouldn't sit back and wait for answers --- he would go after them*.

"Pansy," he whispered when Theodore and Draco began conversing about Quidditch, "since I probably won't see her until tonight, can you get a note to Cassie for me?"

***That night, in the Slytherin dorms...***

Harry sagged into his four poster bed. Fridays were always long and tiring. There was Double Potions, midnight Astronomy, and lessons with Dumbledore --- not to mention the use of his time turner.

Harry sighed and laid his head back against his pillows, only for something bright to catch his eye. There was a bluish glow coming from his trunk. *The journal*.

Harry climbed from bed and pulled a sleek, black journal from his bag.

He shivered. *It still reminds me of Riddle's diary*. Voldemort had sworn the only enchantments on it were ones to let them communicate discreetly. *I have to take his word for it; if he wanted to hurt me, he could have done it three times this summer.*

Harry flipped open the first page with trembling hands.

*It's been almost a month.*

He frowned, but scribbled his reply. *I'm not the best at communicating.*

*And you think I am?* Harry could practically feel the amusement in those words, but he ignored it and wrote his reply.

*You're the one who wanted communication.*

*Bold,* came the reply. *It has been a long time since I've spoken with someone so blunt.* Harry's heart froze. *Did I go too far?* he wondered. The words continued. *It isn't something I've ever encouraged in those who serve me, but it suits you and the relationship I hope we'll have.*

Harry breathed a sigh of relief. *I've never been good at holding my tongue. It got me in a fair bit of trouble before Hogwarts.*

This next reply came faster.

*We both know you would have been punished for existing in the presence of those creatures. You wouldn't have denied that even when we first spoke.*

*No, I wouldn't have. I've gotten a bit better at holding my tongue since Hogwarts, though.*

*The education system is quite proficient at quelling children's spirits. I have wondered at times whether that's the reason Binns remains employed.*

*Where the hell did that come from?* he thought, then wrote his reply. *What do you mean?*

*You will not find another magical institution with a ghost in a position of authority. I could overlook this if Binns was competent, but everyone who's passed through Hogwarts in the last century knows otherwise.*

Harry's frown deepened. *What does that have to do with muggles?*

*Everything. Classes in History of Magic are some of the only times the world cannot pretend that muggles have not wronged us. It is the one time during which their evils are exposed. The problem is that those expositions happen in Binns's class, where most students are more concerned with sleeping than they are with paying attention.*

Harry winced. He had stopped attending Binns's class last year and showed up only for compulsory tests and the like.

*It seems a bit much to believe,* he wrote back after considering. It was an interesting idea, but an insane one. *I know you hate Dumbledore, but I can't imagine him doing that.*

*Can't you?* Harry could practically see Voldemort's sneer. *Can you think of no time when Dumbledore has held secrets from you? Can you think of no time when Dumbledore has ever bent or altered the truth? Can you think of nothing that Dumbledore has ever hidden?*

Angry fires burned, fanned by the Dark Lord's words. *Neville's own family doesn't know how he died,* he thought. *I'll bet Luna's doesn't either, plus there's the prophecy. I only know what he says it means*.

Then there were the memories; the friendship with Grindelwald and the death of his sister. *Maybe more. Who knows what I might learn from Grindelwald*.

*No,* he wrote back, *but that doesn't mean I believe you. Dumbledore keeps Peeves around even though he's a menace. Maybe it's not that easy getting rid of ghosts.*

*It isn't, but it is within Dumbledore's capabilities. For all of his shortcomings, he is still the second greatest sorcerer alive.*

*Will I ever be that confident*? There was no doubt when Voldemort or Grindelwald spoke. It was like they knew the outcome of everything they talked about. *I wish I was powerful enough to be that confident*.

*I doubt this conversation will go anywhere,* Voldemort wrote, *so let's try something else. Have you further investigated the events of last June?*

Confusion fell over him and he frowned. *What do you mean?*

This reply came slowly. *I expected better from you.*

That stung. *Why? Why do I care what Voldemort thinks*? Harry scowled and scribbled his next reply. *What do you mean?*

*Two students have their minds altered by a powerful artifact and you're not curious about the after-effects?*

Harry's eyes narrowed. *I never really had much to do with the Carrows, so I honestly didn't think about them.* How had he not considered them?

*An oversight. I would have at least expected you to show some interest in a place so dear to your house's founder.*

Harry read the words again but still missed their meaning. *What is he talking about*? Then it dawned on him and he sat bolt upright, all weariness gone. *The Chamber of Secrets --- I haven't even explored the Chamber of Secrets*!

**Author's Endnote:**

**There really haven't been many good cliffhangers yet this year. This one will have to do for now. Shame :(**

**I will also just say right here that, if you're hoping Harry will find some vast library or instant power boosts down in the Chamber of Secrets, you will be sorely disappointed.**
