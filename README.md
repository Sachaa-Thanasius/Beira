Beira is a Discord bot meant to serve me and on top of that, emulate Discord's own SnowballCog bot from winter 2021.
It facilitates virtual snowball fights between server members, tracks their scores, and displays them in response to
commands.

Credit: Much of this code was heavily based on the discord.py example code and the personal bots of Rapptz, Umbra -
maintainer and major contributing member of the discord.py community respectively - Rakesh, whose code was the first
implementation of this I saw, and so many others.

Shoutout to Ali for making this possible by inspiring me with their own bot development.
