Beira is a personal Discord bot. It handles music, snowballs fights, and more, though it isn't reliable at present.

Credit: Much of this code was heavily based on the discord.py example code as well as the open-source bots of 
[Rapptz](https://github.com/Rapptz/RoboDanny), [Umbra](https://github.com/AbstractUmbra/Mipha), and 
[Pythonista](https://github.com/PythonistaGuild/Pythonista-Bot/).

Shoutout to Ali for making this possible by inspiring me with their own bot development, as well as Athena for 
entertaining my bot on her server.
