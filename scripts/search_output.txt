Previous: From a ways down the street, a tall, well-dressed man with long,
luscious hair watched the retreating forms of a hulking, rough-looking
man and a much smaller, raven-haired boy with great interest. 

Current: Interest that only mounted when his son and daughter exited the same
store that the black-haired youth in question had just left himself.
Interest that swelled still more when his two children cast furtive,
meaningful glances in the boy’s direction while conversing in low,
hurried whispers.

Next: Yes, Lucius would most certainly be inquiring about all of this.

Current: The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the
hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he
was looking at the black inside of the hat.

Previous: They walked for some time before Diana led him through a tapestry and
onto a stunning balcony, of sorts. They stood on a cobblestone landing
with iron railings overlooking the grounds far below. From this
height, Harry could see everything. From the expansive green lawns to
the lake shimmering and sparkling in the afternoon sunlight, to the
seemingly endless forest on the edge of the grounds, stretching
further than the eye could see.

Current: It was probably the single most beautiful sight Harry had ever seen.
The only other that even compared had been his first sight of Hogwarts
while riding across the black lake almost two weeks ago now. And
wasn’t that just mind-boggling? It had easily been the fastest two
weeks of Harry’s young life, even if they had also been without a
doubt the most complicated.

Next: “It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” asked Diana, smiling fondly out over the
grounds, looking more relaxed than Harry had ever seen her younger
brother.

Previous: The sound of two children laughing might have been heard early one
Saturday morning on the Hogwarts grounds had the wind not ruthlessly
taken the noise and ripped it away, carrying it adrift almost as
rapidly as the source of the sound was flying.

Current: Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy soared above the grounds, laughing
exuberantly as they flew a fast lap of the black lake, the wind
sweeping through their hair and the cool, crisp fall air caressing
their skin.

Next: It was what would likely be one of the last decent fall mornings.
Halloween was fast-approaching — or, as Harry’s new group of friends
called it — Samhain. Many of the upper-year students had warned their
younger counterparts that in the Scottish Highlands, the death of
October often meant the end of any chance at decent weather.

Current: Neville faced the black fire before him with a resolute expression.

Next: He still thought Hermione sending him of all people forward was one of
the craziest ideas anyone had ever had, but he hadn’t been able to
come up with a good enough argument off the cuff. He was better at
Defence Against the Dark Arts, and it was true she could probably get
back up to the main castle to search for a professor faster than he
could

Previous: So Neville Longbottom made a choice. 

Current: He drank the potion and walked forward, marvelling at how the black
flames — which completely obscured his vision — did little more than
tickle his skin. It felt more like submerging in a pleasant bath than
walking through ten-foot-high flames.

Next: Soon enough, the sensation had passed entirely, for Neville had
entered what he instinctively knew to be the final room.

Current: “A few,” the man admitted, “though none I will speak on without
irrefutable confirmation. I am certain that it is only through the
blackest of magics that Lord Voldemort survives. Magics that I will
not dare speak of without just cause, even with you. I trust you
explicitly and know you are very far from a pure soul, but there are
some things that men are just much better off not knowing unless
circumstance deems that blissful ignorance to be impossible.”

Previous: Dealing with that vision had not grown a whole easier in the past few
days. He was at least past the point of vomiting and shedding shocked
tears, but he still shuddered and became withdrawn every time the
memories resurfaced. This made focusing difficult, which limited his
success; something Harry was not at all happy with.

Current: “That will do for tonight, I think,” Dumbledore decided after more
than an hour had passed. Harry sighed and leant back in his chair,
opening his eyes and casting his eyes hastily around the room. He
needed something to focus on that wasn’t the blackness of his eyelids;
that only brought forth the images he wanted to avoid so much.

Next: His eyes eventually found the phoenix that had so entranced him upon
his entrance, and he watched it with a vacant expression. The bird,
which had been sleeping just seconds before, raised its head and met
his gaze once more. It seemed to appraise him, tilting its head to the
side before letting out a note more forlorn than any so far. It
actually felt a pang through Harry’s chest, as though it had a
directly physical effect on him.

Previous: Finally, the corridor ended. There was another to the left and right,
but before them was a massive room that they were led into by their
two guards of honour. This room was lit more scarcely than the
corridor outside, though perhaps it only seemed that way because of
its size. There were no windows, but it was a very long room. At its
front was a long table of rich, dark wood, at which sat men who must
have been the professors. Less comfortable tables spread across the
rest of the hall. They were longer than the professors’ and lined up
one behind the other like rows of desks in a classroom. There were
seven of them in total and he knew at once that each of them were for
a separate year. Gellert and the rest of the first years were led to
the back of the hall. Only then did their guards of ice march to the
front of the hall, bow in perfect unison to an old, hard-looking man
who sat in a black, throne-like chair on the other side of the
professors’ table, and leave the hall. There were a number of other
knights of ice all throughout the room; it seemed that the service of
these two was no longer required.

Current: Gellert’s eyes seemed to devour the room as the man who sat the black
throne took to his feet. Gellert hardly noticed. His eyes darted from
one knight of ice, to a magical sphere of light, and back again. He
watched the older students, too. Some of them watched the first years,
and others still conversed in low voices, but these students were
scarce. Most of them sat with straight backs and polite expressions,
their complete and undivided attention fixated upon the tall, old man
who had taken to his feet.

Next: Gellert cared naught for old men. Gellert cared for the castle and the
magic and all he would learn. Gellert cared for all of the dreams he
would fulfill. Gellert cared for one, undeniable truth. He was finally
at the place he had belonged for all of his years.

describe to one as young as you. But I wanted them all. The
Deathstick, the reaper’s stone, the cloak of invisibility… I wanted
them all. Only by possessing all three could one ever hope to master
death.”

Current: “You believe it, then?” Grindelwald raised an eyebrow; Harry could
hardly see it, but the hair was white and stood out in the blackness
of the cell. “I went and found a copy of the book that was translated
into English in the Hogwarts library. It said that by having all
three—”

Next: “That one would be the master of death. Yes, I have heard that said.”

Previous: They walked for some time before Harry realized that the tunnel was
coming to an end. The footsteps had sounded loud before in the
otherwise silent void, but the sound had drifted up and been lost in
the nothingness high above them. The longer they walked, the louder
their footfalls became as something seemed to throw the noise back at
them.

Current: That something eventually loomed out at them from the blackness up
ahead and Harry heard Draco take a sharp inhale as it came into
sight. 

Next: It was a pair of heavy stone doors weathered by the centuries that had
passed since their construction. There was a pair of elaborate and
interwoven serpents carved on them. Their eyes glowed in the darkness
and they seemed to watch Harry’s every move.

Previous: Harry couldn’t see the girl well from his vantage point with Weasley
in the way, but he could see the streaks of blood coiling out from the
girl like an opening fist of crimson. The smell hung thick and heavy
in the air. Harry was surprised he hadn’t noticed before, but he
supposed he had been preoccupied by exhaustion and agony.

Current: Harry tried to blink the black spots from his eyes, but his vision
only swam with more of them the harder he tried. The room began to
move all around him. The flaming torches were suddenly an orange blur
that was spinning around him faster and faster until he wondered if
his vision was just tinged orange because it seemed to be everywhere.
He could feel his body shaking once more and thought the floor seemed
colder somehow as exhaustion tugged harder than ever at his weary
eyelids.

Next: The last thing Harry wondered before succumbing to the pull of
unconsciousness was how Ron Weasley had gotten his hands on a sword
and how it had ended up in the chest of a sleeping girl.

Previous: I didn’t even know what that meant a few weeks ago. Percy asked Bill
runic questions often and Ron had taken to listening in. Most of it
was beyond him, but he had gathered some basics. Wonder what Hermione
would say if she knew I was going out of my way to learn stuff. His
bubble of pride popped when he remembered the electives he’d chosen.
Stupid, stupid!

Current: “It’s darker than hell down here,” Ron complained in a whisper,
squinting through the black void ahead. One of the cursebreakers’
wands was lit, but Ron hardly noticed.

Next: “That’s typical,” Bill explained. “One of the most common wards we
deal with is one that blocks light. It’s a nightmare to cast, but the
Egyptians were good.”
